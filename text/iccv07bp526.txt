ADDITIONAL FINDINGS gg FACT V

The Commission makes the following findings of fact which are
supplenental to the amended findings numbered 1 to hl, inclusivegli
heretofore nade herein;

h2.i The landlwnich the Commission has neretofore determined was ‘A

. held by petitioners under original Indian title as of January, 1879,

consists of the forner Halheur Indian Reservation as it was defined.

and described in the Executive Order ofiJan1iary'ii2i8,l 1876.’ The boundaries of said tract of land are hereinbefore described in Finding No. 3;
and in the amended interlocutory order of this Conission datedi
'February h, 1957; From.the gross acreage of the described tract tnere"I
‘was to be deducted the lands granted to the Délles Military Roads, and,l

the Commission's amended interlocutory order also provided for the deduction of any lands in said tract acquired cy'Snake or Piute Indians

after 1879.

7 Ind. Cl. Corn. 526 527

In a hearing held on the issues of the acreage of the described

tract and the value thereof as of January, 1879, as provided in the

amended order of'February h, 1957, the parties have stipulated that

after deducting 120,019.16 acres in wagon road grants, 17,941.96 acres

in allotments to Indians after l879, and l0,000 acres because of the
question raised by defendant as to the proper location of the southern
boundary of the tract, the correct net acreage ‘to be valued is l,11h9,30h.77
acres. For convenience the lands involved will sometimes be referred to

as the subject tract or subject lands.
143. The subject tract is located largely in what is now Barney

County in southeastern Oregon. The tract also extends on its eastern

border some twelve miles into Malheur County and on its northern boundary p ,

an area in the shape of a triangle extends about nineteen miles north
into County with its northernmost tip at {Strawberry Butte in the
Blue Mountains. Approximately 75 percent of the tract lies Within Harney
County and  balance is about equally divided «between Grant and I-Ialheur
Counties.   extends in its greatest dimensions, east and_ vest  .
about 600 miles,   and south approximately 65 miles. The gross
area is about twice the size of the State of Rhode Island.

1114. The subject tract is at a considerable altitude. With the
exception of the deep valley of . the j_Malheur , River on the eastern
boundary it is all at an elevation in excess of h,000 feet, arising
along the northern border in the Blue Mountains to 6,000 and 7 ,000
feet with Strawberry Butte at the northern tip reaching an elevation .

of more than 9,000 feet.

 

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 526

The mountainous area in the northern portion of the tract is
largely covered with timber. t the present time an estimated 353,976
acres of the tract lie within the boundaries of the Malheur National

f

Forest, however, not all of this area is forested for scattered throughout the forest are open range areas varying in size from a few acres

to hundreds of acres. ihere is also a sizeable area of mountain meadows
and open grassland between the western boundary of the Malheur Forest
and the upper partrof the hilvies River which forms the western boundary
of the subject tract. . _ .

The southeastern portion of the tract is in the eastern part of
Harney Basin which is an area of nearly level land between the foothills
on the north and Malheur Lake at the southwestern corner of the tract.
The Silvies River flows southerly from the highlands through the center,
of’Harney Basin and empties into Malheur Lake. Heither Malheur nor
HarneydLahe:ehich adjoins it has an outlet. hoth lakes are saline, extremely shallow and subject to a uide fluctuation in size fron.year to _
year. ldenerally the area around thelakes is swampv in the spring.‘
Several small streams to the east of Silvies River also flow from the
highlands on the north into Harney Basin but usually dissipate into the‘
land or evaporate before reaching halheur Lake.

The remainder or thetract was, for the most part, open range land
consisting of wide vallevs and rolling hills on which the growth was
largely bunchgrass interspersed with sagebrush. Both the North and
Middle Forks of the Malheur River head in the mountains on the north

and flow south and easterly through the eastern portion of the tract to

528

7 Ind. C1. Com. S25

join the nain Malheur River at the eastern border, with the South Fork
of the Malheur River forming the southeastern boundary.

Q5. The climate of the subject tract is arid particularly in the
non-timbered area. Temperatures at Burns, Oregon, on the western edge
of the tract range from 11 to 88 degrees above zero. The area has a
short frost-free season. For the extreme southern portion the average
growing season is from 100 to 150 days while the balance of the tract
has a growing season of S0 to 100 days. Average annual precipitation
on subject lands ranges from 10 to 12 inches on the lower portion to
12 to 15 inches on the higher elevations. At least half the precipitation falls in the form of snow during the months of November through
February; The rapid spring run-off from snow tends to prevent most of
thelandfrom receiving the maximum benefitof the precipitation with
the ppossible exception of Harney Basin. L 1

b6. The first white men entered the Harney Basin in 1826 ledby
Peter Skeen_0gden. The area was subsequently visited by Ogden in 1828
and 1822; by John Qork in 1830, 1831, and 1832; by Captain B. L. E.
Bonneville in 133k; and by Colonel John C. Freemont andPierson Barton I
Reading in 18h3. In 18hS and again in 1853 emigrantwagon trains passed
through the tract in a fruitless effort to find a shorter route to the
‘Willamette Valley.

H7. Indian hostilities required the area to be closed, in 1858,
to all whites except Hudsonls Bay employees and missionaries. it was

reopened in 1858 and by the end of 1860 southeastern Oregon was explored and reasonably well mapped. There followed the discovery of

I

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 526

gold in several neighboring localities and the rapid influx of miners.
Gold was discovered along Canyon Creek, north of the subject tract, in
June, l862, and by December of that year there were over 5,000 people
mining on Canyon Creek. however, the depletion of the mining grounds
brought a rapid decline in the population of the area. The population
of Canyon City was 2500 in 1865 and within a few years was less than
600.  

A number of military camps were set up in southeastern Oregon including Camp Steele, established in 1866, on the Snake-Piute tract.. Camp Steele was renamed Fort Harney. In 187h the first post office in

Harney County was established at the Fort, and in 1876 the Fort Harney
Military Reserve of 6h0 acres was created.

,,lnpl869,tvo_Calif0rnia cattlemen formed the partnership of Devine
and fgiodhuxgter and moveda herd. of 2 500 to 3000 cattle- to the abandoned
military camp of C. F. Smith, some 75 miles south of the subject tract.
In the following years a number of cattlemen commenced operations in
the Sumunding areas

The Malheur Reservation was created by Executive Order on Sep-1
tembef 13, 1872. The first school district in the territory embraced .
in Harney County was organized in 1875, and the first business house

was established at the present site of Burns, on the southwest border

of the subject tract, in 1878. In 1879 Grant County, which included

the present Barney County, had a population of h,303.
In 1889 Harney County was cut off from.Grant County, and in 1890

Burns became the county seat. A post office was established at Drewsey

S30

7 Ind. 01. Com. 526 0 S31

in 188a and at Crane in the late 188015. In 1957 a little over 22% of
Harney County was privately owned, and the 1950 census listed 6,113
persons in the County. There are today three towns within the subjecti

tract; Juntura with a 1950 population of 107, Drewsey with 6h, and

Crane with 99.

H8. 0n the date in question transportation facilities were
virtually nonexistent. The early settlers made their way to the territory by overland trails. There were, in 1879, railroad facilities at

'Winnemucca, Nevada, 250 miles to the southeast. §rom.l88S until 1916

the Harney Basin area was supplied from Ontario, 130 miles to the east.
In 1916 the Oregon Short Line extended a branch line to Crane, and in

l92h the line was extended to Burns.

i"h9. iBoth parties are in agreement that the highest and best use
for the subject tract was for cattle ranches. ‘This conclusion is clearly

supported by the evidence of record.

50.~ The first permanent settlers in the general area under consid»
eration were cattlemeng and stockraising has remained the principal;“
if not the sole; industry of the area. with the exception or the nore

recent addition of the lunber industry; “A number of big operators hadt'

herds of thousands in the area and there were also small herds in the

region. The cattle population o£'Harney County for successive decades.
beginning with 1890 was:

1890 3h,h62

1900 69.531

1910 97,97lii

Even by the evaluation date of 1879 there were enough cattlemen
in the area to make the ranchers aware of the grouing'competition for
choice range areas for while the region was vast in extent; it was not
inexhaustible.r The two primary musts for a successful livestock op-"
eration in the region were stock water and winter feed. The areas
consisting of swamp, flood and overflow lands, the sub-irrigated natural
meadow regions and small amounts of land susceptible to use through irL“”
rigation were in demand for the winter feed and the areas along thee
streams and about the few springs were sought after as the sources of
water.i

A cattleman who could acquire stock water ind lands for ninter‘feed.
could then control large areas of grazing lands; under the “free range"
practice. Under this principle'an-individual, partnership, or corporation
could run privately owned cattle on_the public domain uithout cost. In
his book, "Harney'County3 Oregon, and Its Range Land,“ deorgeIFrancis
Brimlow'wroteaon page S§:"

i‘“Free range was enthroned; In the frontier history of"

.America, fields not enclosed became common pasture land.

As late as 1890 the United States Supreme Court declared

that from.a custom of 100 years had grown an ‘implied p

license’ that the country's public lands should"be free

to the people who seek to use them where they are left _ 5

open and unenclosed, and no act of gorernment forbids this

use.‘ Restraining laws, honever grew apace with settlement.“

The Supreme Court said in Buford V; Houtz (1890) l33 U. S. 320, 326,

"We'are of opinion that there is an implied license, growing out of the
custom of nearly a hundred years,_that the public lands of the United

tates, especially those in which the native grasses are adapted to the

7 Ind. Cl. Com. S26 % 533

growth and fattening of domestic animals, shall be free to the people
who seek to use them, where they are left open and uninclosed, and no
act of government forbids this use.” The Court went on to point out
that a large portion of t.e beef which had been consumed in this country
was the meat efheattle thus raised, it being the custom.for ranchers to
raise and fatten their herds upon the uninclosed lands of the government.
The Court went on to say on_page 327, “Of course the instances became
numerous in which persons purchasing land from the United States put
only a small part of it in cultivation, and permitted the balance to remain uninclosed and in no way separated from.the lands owned by the

United States. All the neighbors who had settled.near one of these

prairies or on it, and all the people who had cattle that they wished

l,to graze upon the public lands,_permitted them to run at large over the

whole region, fattening upon the public lands o£~the United States and:

upon the uninclosed lands of the private individual without let or

K

hindrance.“

M: In ld79 a correspondent of the Colusa, California, “Sun“visited
the ranches o£'G1enn and French in thesteensmbuntains countrv,just
southeast of the subject tract, and wrote: i l L

“It is a stock ranch, and covers an area of seventy-five
miles long'by twenty miles wide ... The streams rise on the
west side of Stein /3157 mountain and flow in a northwesterly
course, and sinking_or'spreading into broad marshes go to
contribute to the waters of lakes Malheur and Barney.

“The valleys are thirty or forty miles long and from.six Vs
to twelve miles in width. The soil is wonderfully fertile;
the climate is not excessive, and fine grain and vegetables .
are produced in abundance every year, and of the best quality.

 

_.¢—-——-_-—..—._ -.-‘:-q..-1-*7 Ind. Cl Com. 526
The gently sloping hills are covered with bunch grass, and
the

wild grass of the valley will produce a ton and a half
of hay to the acre. Here are rich-and beautiful homes for
500 families with ample stock range for all. Glenn and
French hold this vast body of land by the right of undisturbed possession. 'We were told by his bookkeeper that
no part of the immense track /§ic7 of land over which

25, 000 head of cattle roam nee’ e?.v'er passed any kind of
title. It is true it would be a little unsafe for a
settler to go into this country and attempt to make a
homestead, for all such are treated as interlopers, and
quickly invited to emigrate . . .” Agricultural History,

The winters were mild enough to permit the herds to survive with

little or no shelter and requiring but small amounts of winter feed.

In 1868 J. Ross Browne wrote:

_ “It may certainly be said of the upper Columbia basin,’
considering its altitude and high latitude, its climate

is remarkable for mildness. On the open prairie the snow,
never deep, seldom covers the ground a week at a time; in
the heavy timber and in sheltered places it remains much
longer on the surface.. It is seldom essential to house or
feed stock, though occasional severe winters serve as
‘warnings to provide food and shelter. One or two month‘s
feed is the extent which necessity ever requires in the
heaviest winters.“ Agricultural History, Vol. 21, No. b,
October, 19h? (Def. "'”ax"‘e""““‘T"". 2 3, p. 219     l

51. The stockmen of the 1879 period found ready markets for their
cattle in the immediate area at the mining camps, military outposts and

small settlements. Herds were also driven to markets in the Pacific

. Northwest and California as well as to eastern markets. The lack of ime

mediately'ayailable transportation was not of too great an importance
since cattle could be driven long distances, grazing on the open range

on the way.

52. (a) Petitioners‘ expert appraiser, Henry T. Murray, has classified the land of the subject tract as follows:

_Non-timbered grazing ‘ 870,179.73 ”
Total 1,hh9,3oh.77 “

Mr. Murray's land classification was based on aerial photographs and
checked with a personal aerial flight and by car.

(b) Mr. H;.A. Palmer, who testified for petitioners as to the *
forested areas of the tract, reported that 228,201 acres contained timber.
His estimate was based on the l9h6jEorest Service reinventory of the
forest resources of the area.

(c) Defendant's expert appraiser, C. Marc Miller, reported that
the Use Capability Hap issued bythe Soil Gonservation Service and the

Oregon State Agricultural Experiment Station in 1953 (Def. Ex. 290) indicated then" rc1icwing‘1and" classifications for the subject tract:

I“ Class II I
-5 Class III e _
Classes VI &.VII

  Total i'i 1,h37,362 acres.

However,.it was hr. Miller's judgment that the Classes II and III

estimates based on the Use Capability'Eap_was too low (lD9,72B acres),

535

and he estimated the proper acreage of the natura1.hayaproducing lands; g

sub-irrigated pasture lands and potentially irrigable lands to be approxia

This estimate he based on personal inspection

where he found open areas in the forested portion of the tract and along

the water courses where-several thousand acres were being utilized for
the production of hay and for sub-irrigated pasturage.

Mr. Miller's classification of the lands was:

.7 Ind. Cl. Com. S26 S37

Swamp, overflow, flood lands,
natural meadows and potentially

irrigable lands (Bottom land) l20,52h acres,
Forest lands 3).;6,903
Range lands (Grazing land) 969,935’
9 9 Total ,- 91,1137, 362 acres

The figures after the stipulated adjustments would be:

Bottom land ' 116,201; acres
Forest land 346,903
r- Grazing land ' 9 986,198

1,hh9,30S acres

(d) Since any successful ranch operation depended upon an adequate
supply of water as well as a source of winter feed, the well watered
bottom lands were in substantive demand  1879. In this generally a‘ .
arid area control of the ‘water areas was of prime importance. The choice
localities along streams and the swamps, flood and overflow glands and
sub-irrigated aaaddaa were limited and, having gained title to suah
areas, a cattlernan would be able to control the surrounding grazing land

--n

which was golrernment owned.

IA’etitioner’s' expert appraiser has broken this‘ choice land down * into
two  of bo ttom land, namely the irrigablet  9) su.b-irrigated
(90 acres) and the non-irrigable (39 ,l25 .01.; acres) . This gives a
total of 129 ,léS.h0’.L acres of bottom land by petitioners‘ figures) while Y

the expert appraiser for defendant ‘categorized llé, 201; acres as bottom

land. As compared to the total acreage of the subject tract petitioners ‘

claim.there was 8.91% or bottom land while defendant claims 8.ori o£ r“

bottom land .

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 526 d I _ 0 539

A larger percentage of the tract was in timbered lands which were
mainly composed of.an open ponderosa pine stand permitting forage grasses
to grow among the trees. ‘The trees shaded the ground causing the snow
to melt more slowly and, as a result, provided a fine grass for summer
grazing. The forested area was considered ideal for a summer range.

Petitioners'.expert appraiser placed hS0,000 acres in his.so-called
mountainous and timbered grating while accepting the expert §orester's
estimate that 228,201 acres contained timber.

Defendant's expert appraiser allotted 3h6,903 acres to his forest

C

land category.
The remaining lands of the subject tract were the range or grazing

lands which mere composed of the generally dry areas which mere mainly

covered_with excellent bunch grass. Petitionersl expert appraiser I

classified 870,179.73 acres of the tract inthatcategory and defendant’s L

) .

expert appraiser listed 986,128 acres as grazing land.‘ «a “I
an .53.l The timbared portions of the suhjectltractiwere approximatelp ;

.' O‘.o

91% Ponderosa pine with the remaining 9% of larch, logepole pine, uhite
fir and red fir.’ It constituted an excellent stand of timber both as j.

to quantitf and quality; However; in 1879 there'was a verj'limited"
market for timber products in the area and conseduently little demand.‘
for land to be used for logging purposes.‘

The first 5;. mill in what is now Harneyi2ountp‘was set {p b; A.

H. Robie in l86S on the subject tract just north of Fort Harney. MThat

.mill cut the lumher and shingles used for the construction of Fort I

Harney. In 1877 Samuel C. Dore built a mill on Canyon Creek, just

7 Ind. Cl. Com. S26 ' 539

outside the northwest edge of the tract, and he supplied the mining
communities of John Day and Canyon City with lumber for buildings and
timbers for the mines. There were a number of other small saw mills,
many of them portable, which operated in the area in the late 1800's
and early 1900's. However, none of them out any significant volume
of lumber. They were used to supply the small“local demand, and petitioners‘ timber expert, Mr. M. A. Palmer, testified no records had been

,found that the early mills ever owned or purchased any timber or timber-.

lands. 'They'cut timber off public lands. There was no outside market
for lumber products of the area in l8?9 and there were no transportation

facilities which could be used to get lumber out of the immediate Vicinity;

..As stated in the sale prospectus issued by the U. S. Forest Service inst

1922, "The pine timber on the south side of the Blue.Hountain region, in

east central Oregon has never been operated except in insignificant

amounts for local use." (Pet. Ex. 89, p. 36)
The development of the lumber industry in the area in 193D and the

ioperations of thefamous Edward Hines Lumber Company outside of Burns,
Oregon, were ra§‘£5t remote in time from the valuation date to be con;i
sidered as any basis for computing an 1879 value for timber lands.
Accordingly, the Commission finds that the forested areas in the
subject tract were valuable primarily as a fine summer grazing area for
stock and the timber in itself had a value only to the extent that 1ua.i
her was required in local-construction. This very limited demand for

lumber would not give any appreciable value to the forested areas by i

virtue of the timber thereon.

 

7 Ind. Cl. Com. S26 5&0

5h. There was no‘evidence of known minerals in the subject tract

in 1879, or to this date, and no claim is made for any value to the land

by reason of minerals.

SS. 'ln addition to the use of the choice bottom land for raising
winter feed for the cattle, that land also was useful in raising subsistence crops for the ranch homes in the area. ,However, due to the

short grdwing“season,-the type of crops which could be produced was
limited, and there is no evidence of any commercial farming in the area.S6. Individuals in 1879 could acquire federally owned land under

National Forest. dwhile a large area in Barney County is also included
in the National Forest, it is that County which has thegreatest percentage of privately owned land because itrincludes virtually all of the

58. (a) No evidence has been introduced indicating the consideration
paid for any sale prior to 1879 of a tract comparable to the subject area.
‘while Mr. Millerls appraisal report lists sales in 1877 of 2,000 acres,
hS,0OO acres and h3g36O acres,*the true consideration for the sales
.cannot be determined.

Most of the early ranch operators acduired choice lands from Oregon
under the state's "Swamp Act.“ is George Francis Brimlon writes in his
book, "Harney County Oregon, and Its Range Land":

"Major E. S. Otis, for whom.Otis Creek was named, was

in command at Fort Harney in 1870 when Mace McCoy came

there from Walla'Halla. McCoy intended to take a preemption or homestead claim on what is called McCoy Creek,

8 6l. ?etitioners* expert appraiser, Henry T. Murray, has set forth
in his detailed report (Pet. Ex. 91) his approach to the problem of
evaluating the subject tract as of January, 1879. He has based his report and testimony on the basis that the value of the tract was the
fair market value. _As he stated "the problem.in this appraisal is to.
estimate a price which the hypothetical investor would be justified in
paying, after having acquired full knowledge of the property and of the
market as a one-unit or ‘wholesale’ transaction taking the entire property in one purchase“ (Pet. Ex. 91, p. 86).

Mr. Murray, in his report and testimony before the Commission,

has enumerated the various factors upon.which.he states he has based
his conclusion as to the fair market value of the subject tract. “He

concluded that the subject tract had a January, 1879, fair market value

of $3,000,000 or an average value per acre of $2.07. His computations

were as follows:

The per acre average figures which Mr. Murray used in the above,
computations were calculated from.his analysis of sales of what he

considered comparable land. As detailed in our Findings 59 and 60,g

-the sales data gathered by Mr. Murray are of little value in relating

the prices for those tracts to the value of the subject tract. 1n_addition the process by which the various per acre figures were computed_p
render Hr. Murray's analysis of sales figures and.his ultimate conclusions
of little value in determining the fair market value of the lands in
January, 1879.

Mr. Murray has included in his table of Harney County bottom.land
sales some 2h transactions of tracts ranging in size from.h0 to 161.53

acres at considerations averaging from $h.37 to $1h.86 an acre at dates

up to seven years after the eva1*"tion date. (2 sales in 1878, 2 sales

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 526

in 1882, 3 sales in l883, 2 sales in l88h, h sales in l88S, l0 sales
in l886, 1 sale not shown).- From.these sales he has computed an
average per acre price for the 2b small sales of $6.76 an acre. Of
the bottom land sales listed, 7 were for more than $10.00 per acre,
which Mr. Murray found to have possibly included improvements. However, he still included the sales with a 20% adjustment. His adjustment was unsupported save by his own statement that he found some
assessment records which indicated that improvements averaged 20% of
the value of the land involved. The sources and dates of the assessment records were not given. In any event, the adjustment was entirely speculative as applied to these 7 sales and such use of assessment records is legally unacceptable as a basis for computing fair
market value of property. If thew? sales which Mr..Murray concedes
probably included improvements were excluded, the per acre average of
the 16 remaining sales would have been about $5.72 per acre. Had.
Mr. Murraj included the 10 Harney_County "grazing land" sales which
Mijhwould appear involved bottom.land (see'Finding 60(a)) the average.
per acre figure would be further reduced to $h.ll per acre. ,s

The average per acre price for these small sales Mr; Murray referred to as "retail sales.” Recognizing that the tract in this case
must be valued as a whole,-he then made certain computations to adjust
his “retail sales" figures. ‘Mr. Murray, at page 87 of his report
(Pet. Ex. 91) stated, “It is the judgment of this appraiser that . . .

a buyer would expect-to buy the entire tract at something less than

the market prices shown above. It would appear that this buyer would

Sh?

-49 -u.-n...aw-I-an 7 Ind. Cl. Com. 526 ' s *3;

be justified in expecting that the price he would pay would be such as
to enable him to get some return on his investment in the way of interest and a return of cash outlay, such as taxes paid." Mr. Murray
has assumed that a hypothetical buyer would be satisfied with a return
of 6% on his investment. Mr. Murray estimated that the average length
of time for return of capital in a transaction involving the subject
tract would be 10 years. ‘By multiplying his average per acre figure by
.S53h (the value of a dollar to be returned with 6% interest in lo years}
and subtracting $0.10 (the average amount of taxes at $0.01 per acre for
10 years), he then arrived at his so-called wholesale average per acre
value.

While this Commission does not agree that Mr. Murray*s method of"

 

arithmetically adjusting “retail sales" data to a “wholesale” figure is
3 PT0E8f or realistic approach to the problem ofvaluing the subject
tract; it should be observed that applying his factors to the average
of his Barney County bottom land sales, after excluding the objectionable
a sales of what appearsto beimproved tracts and including the bottom '
land sales which he improperly put in his grazing land sales conpu- "
tations, tould result in an average per acre figure of $i.l9 ($g.ll.x *
~558b minus $0.10 taxes equals $2.19).
The Commission finds that Mr. Murray's "grazing land" sales tabulations include many bottom.land sales and sales of grazing land on

creeks and other sources of water. The few small sales of the choicest

grazing land spots do not establish that all grazing land was as valuable.

-“‘IiO-11""
Q

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 526 551

Another objectionable aspect of Mr. Murray's report is the process by which he arrived at his average per acre value of mountainous
and timbered-grazing land;i He detailed the reasons why the mountainous
and timbered land was valuable for choice summer grazing and concluded
that the mountainous area had a cattle carrying capacity of twice that
of the non-timbered grazing areas although the Commission finds no evidence to support such a conclusion. Since he had computed the average
per acre price for other grazing lands at $2.11 he concluded that the

fair market value of the mountainous grazing would be $h.SO per acre.

.The Commission finds it difficult to follow the logic of this reasoning

especially when it realizes that this method'was resorted to because
there was a.complete lack of any evidence of any sales of the mountainous
and tinbered grazing land. Further, Hr. Murrav has added $0.28 to what
would be twice the $2.11 grazing land figure. 2 N22

Then to rtother boost his estimate Mr; Murray has added another
$5oo,ooo.o for timber potential. on the basis or his estimate of time  
her land.acreage. 228,261 acres. this nould.be'an addition of $2.l9 per
oacre for the timbered area. This figure added to the $2.51 for timbered
grazing land results in an absurd $h.6O average per acre value for thee 2
timbered.acreage. I 2 if 2

The Commission finds that the addition of $100,000.00 to the value

. by virtue of the value of so-called excess waters of the Malheur River

has no basis in law or fact.

of January,“l8'?9. "e has detailed the variety of factors which affected
the fair mar1~:et value of the land as- of the valuation date. The Commission‘ has found hisreport ‘to be most helpful in reaching its gultignate
finding’ of value.

" '  Iii his summary Mr. Filler has stated:

' ' "After a careful consideration of all the factors affelcting»;
-,the value of the lands of the Snake-Piute tract here being‘ ' '
' valued, it is my opmion that a well-informed hypothetical .

_ purchaser of these lands as of January 1879, would have re‘ cognized that the sat , overflow, flood, natural meadow,‘ I
_ and potentially irrigable lands of the Tract there existed '
‘sf substantialdemand and a brisk market... That for the dry
range land there existed no demand and no market, but that
this range land was vitalto the livestock economy-of the _
region and had a very high use value. That the forest lands
"of the regionlhad an equally high use value for grazing purposes but that for the timber growing thereon no market
existed and no present nor foreseeable future demand existed.

The purchaser would have felt that he could dispose of the swamp,

overflow, flood, natural meadow, and potentially irrigable land
L ,without undue delay, and that he could probably dispose of the

‘dry range land, inclusive of the fore st‘ area, -with the hay and

subjirrigated pasture lands in a package deal. But he would

-. also have realized that the additional sum whichhe ' could hope
to secure for the grazing lands (inclusive of the forest area)
would be small. ‘To "the value of the forested ‘land as a range

.area, he could have afforded to add nothing more "than a nominal sum by reason of the timber growing th_ereon.'.': (Def. 

E3. 296, p. "89, 90)

The Commission, however, would take exception to the conclusion

by Mr. Miller that “for the dry range land there existed no demand and

no market." This we believe to be an overstatement of the true situation.
First, an examination of the large area classified as the dry grazing
land reveals a number of small watered areas with springs or small creeks
which were desirable locations and for whichihere was a demand. Second,
the early cattlemen were experiencing difficulties in acquiring legal
title to large areas.for expanding cattle operations. As George Francis
Brimlow wrote in "Harney County Oregon, and Its Range Land," quoting a
pioneer attorney of Harney County, John'W. Biggs:

"At this time this was all Government, State or specially
~ allotted land. The State owned all of the swamp and school
lands, several road companies held large grants, a great
part was an Indian reservation, but none was occupied by
white people. It was the custom for several years thereafter
for anyone to squat and call the land around, upon which he
could settle, his own, and began to use it as his property.
s A short time thereafter outside persons began to purchase
the State lands, and this caused these earliest settlers to
futake notice; and in self defense to try to acquire a legal.
e claim.to the lands which.they had held up to that time, by
right of possession only. .As the laws at that time did not
. allow anyone who was largely interested in livestock to acquire
“sufficient lands to feed and care for a great number of stock,
“it became a custom.among the early settlers to acquire a partr
of their lands through subterfuge, and also another part.r
through a liberal construction, at the very least, of the _~
law." (Pet. Ex. 90, p. 75, 76) . s

The competition for lands was to lead in the l880!s to fights,'both legal
and otherwise, over rights to the range lands of the area. George Francis
Brimlow wrote of the fatal shooting in l88S of Johnny Overstreet over an
alleged trespassing on to another range land. There were many instances

of “dummy” entry on land and there were complaints of unjust actions

 

7 Ind. 0:. Com. 525 L Ssh

taken by the land offices in disposing of lands. Mr. Brimlow reported
that Devine’s vast ranch empire dwindled when patents to the swamp
land were declared illegal by the state and Devine had to rebuy them
from speculators. (Pet. Ex. 90). Had large tracts been available in‘
the area, the cattlemen would have been able to acquire legal title to
desirable ranch areas and, we believe, would have been interested in
such purchases.
The Commission finds that there would have been a limited demand

for the grazing land in the area although no prospective purchaser could
have afforded to pay a substantial amount for such acreage.

Mr. Miller computed his fair market value on the tract as follows:

Swamp, overflow, flood, natural
meadow and potentially irrigable

lands; Class II and III .......... l20,S2h acres @ $2.00/acre
Forest lands ..................... 3hé,903 acres-@‘ .15/acre

Dr§'bunch grass grazing lands .... 969,935 acres @ .10/acre
This resulted in an overall valuation of $390,076.95 or about $0.27

per acre .'

53. Upon the basis of the record and the facts as found above, the
Commission finds that the subject tract, consisting of l,hh9,30h.?? acres,
had a fair market value as of January, l8?9, of $579,722.60 or an average
per acre value of $O.hO.
