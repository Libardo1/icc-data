42 Ind. Cl. Com. 179 180

2. The Petition. On March 22, 1978, Rodney J. Edwards, attorney of

' fee on

record in this case, filed a petition for an award of attorneys
behalf of himself and all other contract attorneys having an interest in
the fee in Docket 18-8. The petition requests the Comission to make an
award of attorneys’ fee in the amount of $851,612.83, being 10 percent of
the final judgment of $8,516,128.32, which was entered in this docket.

3. Notice of Filing to Executive Agencies and Plaintiffs. By letters
of March 22, 1978, enclosing a copy of the petition for attorneys‘ fees,
the Clerk of the Commission notified the head officers of plaintiffs (the
Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, the St. Croix Band, the Red Cliff Band, the
Bad River Band, the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, the Lac Courte O'Reilles
Band, the Lac De Flambeau Band, the Sokaogon Chippewa Community), the
United States Department of the Interior, and the United States Department
of Justice of the filing of subject petition for attorneys‘ fee in this
docket. No response has been received from any of the plaintiff Indian
tribes or bands.

On June 15, 1978, the Comission received a reply from the Department
of Justice wherein it is stated that the Department takes no position with
reference to the amount of attorneys‘ fee in this case. The Justice
Department also forwarded to the Commission with its reply a copy each
of a letter dated June 14, 1978, from the Associate Solicitor, Division
of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, and a memorandum dated

June 5, 1978, from the Assistant Secretary--Indian Affairs, Department of

the Interior.

lg Ind. Cl. Conn. 179 181

The memorandum report of the Assistant Secretary-—Indian Affairs, in
which the Solicitor's Office concurred, found that the attorney contracts
with the Chippewa Tribe and groups and assignments of interest were

accurately described in the petition and concluded, with regard to the

claimed fee, as follows:

While the total fee allowable in the case as compensation

earned by the attorneys is not to exceed $851,612.83, this

Bureau did not participate in the litigation, thus, we do

not have sufficient detailed information upon which to

make a recommendation as to the amount of compensation

earned by the claims attorneys.
