p p A Upper Creek: Chiefs at Tuckazibatchee, and persuaded them to adopt a

 cases two men) was selected from each group to superintend the exe cution of the law in that division. The distinctive functions of

grouped. together, but it was "unanimously agreed that the E-tall-wau,
white towns, should. be classed. as warriors“ in their relation to the
Confederacy. Hawkins also persuaded the Lower ‘Creeks to adopt the same
plan. A general council was held. once a year, and the Chiefs of eafch
town were delegates. When occasion demanded the Lower and Upper
divisions of the nation held their own councils and each division had
speakers who held their office indefinitely. coweta and Tuck-anbatchee,
the two most important towns of the Lower and Upper Creeks, respectively,
alternately as the occasion reqxired, were appointed. the permanent seats
of their national councils where national affairs alone could be transacted. When the national council met at Coweta, Tustunnuggee Eopoie,

the Speaker of the Lower C-reeks, was the Speaker of the Nation; and when
the council met at Tuckaubatchee, Tustdnnuggee Ehlucco (Big Warrior),
Speaker of the Upper Creeks, was the Speaker of the Nation. All matters

were debated and when agreed upon were expressed by the Speaker as the

will of the nation.

The individual town governments were still maintained under this

new‘ plan and each town still controlled its own local affairs as

formerly.

The English, therefore, sent the celebrated. Tecumseh to enlist the

When Tecumseh left to return to Detroit he was accompanied by

been sent by the Creek Nation on a mission of peace and friendship to
the Ghicka.saws. Instead of returning home after his mission was completed, Little Warrior had gone to Detroit with Tecumseh. On his return
the Creek Council convened at Tuckabatchee to hear the report of Little
Varrior, and the nature of the talks he carried from the Shawanese and
British. On learning that the talks were to engage the Creeks in a.
war with the whites the Creek Council severely'reprimended\ Little
Warrior, and ordered him iznmediately to leave the council house as a
man unworthy to have a seat in it.
A 6. On his return from Detroit, Little Warrior and his party

had murdered seven white families at the mouth of the Ohio. Upon
being advised of these murders, Colonel Hawkins, on March 29, 1813,
wrote to the creek Chiefs demanding that they apprehend and deliver

the murderers to him for punishment, stating that ’3The guilty must
suffer for their crimes, or your nation will he involved in their
guilt.‘ The Creek National Council convened on April 9, 1813, at

" Tucbnbatchee, and sent a party of warriors under Colonel William

McIntosh, Speaker oi‘ the Lower Creeks, and Captain Isaacs, of the
Upper Creeks, with instructions to put Little Warrior and his party

to death. T§s order of the Creek Council was fully executed.

.As the strength of the hostiles increased, in an effort to

T.
unite the Creekzhation against the.Americans, the hostiles began a

civil war against the Creek Chiefs, the friends of peacee-the constituted

authority of the Creek.Hation-and the friendly part of the Creek Nation,

destroying their houses, killing or driving off their cattle, and stealing whatever portable property the friendly Indians possessed. The lhostiles stated that

'* ‘ * they would destroy Tuckabatchee and Coweta,
with.every person in them; then kill Mr. Cornells, Tustunnuggee Thlucco, Mr. Hawkins, and the old chiefs who
had taken his talks; after this war among themselves,
they would be ready for the white people. They had
power to destroy them by an earthquake, or rendering
the ground soft and airy, and thunder.

'* ‘ * The prophets are enemies to the plan of
civilization, and advocates for the wild Indian mode

of living. ' * ‘.“

This plan.of the Prophets had been kept secret from the Chiefs
of the Ration, and was so guarded that even Colonel Hawkins was not

apprised of it until it was disclosed by one of the hostile leaders

to a friendly Indian.

8, On June 23, 1813, the Creek Chiefs at Tuckabatchee sent

runners to Colonel Hawkins, stating;

‘The prophets have put to death.two more of our
warriors; we have about 190 here, and expect more.
We are of opinion, if the prophets cannot be crushed,
they will bring ruin on us, and war against the white
people. We have need of assistance, and we wish.you,
Colonel Hawkins, to assist us, by joining the white
'warriors with ours. Yours can come the post road H
opposite to us; we will then join them, go with our
forces united, march on both sides of Alabama, and
put an end to these hatchers of war and nischief. By

showing them they are both feeble and ignorant, they
will be crushed; as neither thunder, quagmire, or the
sun, will come to their aid. They can soon be conquered, and those who support them at the lakes, be
disappointed in their hopes of war. If your troops
are so situated you cannot send them, write to our
friend the Governor of Georgia. We hope he will help
us, and then we shall have peace. Making peace here
in this way, is making peace for our white neighbors
as well. as for ourselves.“

One of the Prophets was present when the above message was

comunicated to Colonel Hawkins, and believing from what he heard.

 the plan was discovered observed, with warmth:

“' "' " the prophets of Alabama had. begun
prematurely. They were to go on with their magic
until Tecumseh arrived, who was to put the plan in
motion, and. he would come when his friends the
British were ready for him.“

9. On June 28, l8l3, Colonel Hawkins wrote the Secretary
of War:

‘The rising of all the Indians was not to have
commenced at all sooner than the beginning of autumn,
nor then unless the British were ready. But it is
probable an order had come on, from Tecumseh, the
Prophet of the lalces, to put to death the persons who

executed the murderers, to prevent the party being
dispirited. They were not to disturb the travellers

"cm the road, as it might give alarm to the white people
too soon. The Alabams have a; pretty good supply of
powder; the other Indians badly armed and supplied with
ammunition.”

10. on July 5, 1313, a runner came from Tuckaxibatchee to
Colonel Hawkins with the following message from the Creek Chiefs:

'&e chiefs have sent me to state to you that
their difficulties continue to increase. Their opponents have killed, in all, nine of their people, one
of them a woman. Fooscehaujo, of Auttossee, is missing,
supposed, to be murdered, as blood was seen in one of his
houses. He was a good m, and opposed. to mischief-were.
The chiefs sent two__ of their great men, Tuskeenohau. of
Cussetah, and Atchan. 'E'.a.uJo, of Coweta, to Hoboheilthle I-Iicco,

projects thrown aside, and repeated their message. But
the oldgman rejected everything, declared his determination _to persevere until he destroyed all who aided
and assisted to put the xmirderers to death. He looked
on__, them as people of the United States. He would mrch
from Tuckaubatchee to Goweta, destroy all of them, and
move on for the white people, and would not stop till he
had marched to Ogeechee. There he would pause and rest,
then put off for the sea coast. All north of this line
of march would be destroyed by the British. He had been
plotting this secretly for some time, and now having
brought it to bear, he was determined not to stop. He
had his bows, his-arrows, and war clubs, and, with the
magic powers he possessed, aided by the British and
Sbawanese, who were now coming from the Northwest, and were
nownore than half way to him, he was able to crush the
Americans, and would do it.

satisfaction for the murders on the post road on Duck

By doing justice to the white people, they are to be

‘punished with death. They have about 30 fit for war,

but badly armed, and without ammunition. They fear not

may expect it. The prophet*s party have burned the

village of Hatchechubbau and several detached settlements,

and destroyed cattle, hogs, horses, and corn. All who are
friends to the United States are doomed to destruction. _i
This is our true situation: We ask for aid from the white
people. If you, Colonel Hawkins, can not afford it from
troops of the United States, who we hear are towards the
seacoast, as}: the Governor of Georgia to aid us. If they
could send from__6OO to 800 mounted men in two divisions,
one on theold the other on the new post road,’ to unite
near the bridges, anUchee Creek, and then along the mail
road, we would join. them with 200 horsemen, point out and
attach our enemies. A mmberof well-disposed Indians
would join. We Imnw, when this is done, we shall conquer
them. we are willing the lands on Alabama should go to
pay our white friends, who, although in aiding us, will
effectually aid themselves. We have sent to the Cherokees
for aid, but know not the success. If we are destroyed
before you aid us, you will have the work to do yourselves,
which will be bloody, and attended with difficulties, as
you do not know as well as us the swamps and hiding places
of those people. He can not find that the Spaniards have
any hand in this, but can clearly trace it to the British
on the Lakes.”

he would write the fanatical chiefs demanding an explanation of their
conduct, and did so.

eriohg the Greeks, it was’ in fact a. ‘branch of the war of 1812-the
hostile portion of the Upper Creeks as the allies of Great Britain,
and the friendly portion of the Upper Greeks, and most of the Lower
Creeks as allies of the United States and none hostile.

13. In the ‘beginning the British had been able to disaffect
one town only, the .AJ.aba1nas-and had well supplied then with arms and
ammunition. , Through fear and the display of power, the Alahamas were

fast bringing over some of the other Upper Creeks to them. The

‘hostile Upper Creek warriors fell upon 23'of their old Chiefs, who

were opposed to war, and destroyed them in quick succession, and then
united under two leaders of the opposition, Peter Hcqueen and
Eohoheilthle Hicco. The surviving Upper Creek Chiefs called upon
Colonel Bat-d:!.ns for the aid of the United States, to preserve their
lives and possessions. t

Hawkins of the plight of the creek Chiefs at i’u.ch.nbatchee, as

follows:

_ 'Dear Friend: I have arrived from the Tuckatxhatchee,
and they are in great distress. I have sent two hundred
a.nd__ somepodd warriors to their assistance. The talk: you
sent on to the prophet man, I sent on with the warriors,
to take it to Tuclcazfoatchee, and try to get it to them
from there. I heard that they were around Tuckaubatchee,
and I sent on my men to get in and save them; and if the
enemy fired on them, to return the fire; and if, they were
for peace, to return again. The prophet‘s men want the
Big Warrior, his son, and the Mad. Dog's son, Tuskanmigee
Hopoie; and if they only give them up, ‘ they would make
peace with the nation. The answer is, what is the reason
they are killing cattle and people when they want only
thesethree men? But they need. not try to fool all of us,
for they say they will battle with all who take the white

-people's talk. °

‘I learn again, that peace is not to be made, until
they destroy Tuclenbatchee, Coweta, and Cussetah. The ‘men
in Tuckauhatchee are bad off for powder, and,-for that
reason, they can not turn out to fight, but keep it until
the war party charges on the fort, to defend it. The war
partyhave taken powder from two men that were carrying it
into the fort. The war party are strong in powder. If they
will not see the talk you sent them, I emect it will be the
worse ior them. The Chattahoochee people have heard the Tame
kingfs talk. William Kinnard and the Wolf Warrior have done
all they can to get’ their people good, when they left them,
and these two are gone to Tuckrauhatchee.

"The war talk is gone to the Seminoles, but I emect
peace will be made with them and the white people. I have
received your talks, and sent them, and you must look for
an answer; and if you do not see or hear of an answer in a
few days you may think it istbad times. I hold you as my
father; I have not forget the talks you gave me; we were
all friends, but it is not so now. I have given all the
ammunition out to go and assist w friends. If they don’t
make peace, they will fight until all of it is gone, and one
party or the other will ‘be conquered. You have sent them a
good and friendly talk, and we have done the same. I am
afraid it will do no good for them to save their country.

I have sent on yours; if they will not receive this talk,
we must look for protection.

‘'Before we lose the Big Warrior, we will all die
for him, or get him from them. Perhaps, when the war
party see all my men, it may put a iright on them, and,
by that means, take your talk. A great many people, who
‘ took the prophet's talk, have since thrown it away. Kialijee,
to a. child, has come to the Big Harrier. The Hillaubee took
the talks, but the Cherokees turned them, by telling them,
take care we do not frighten ycurchildren. And. they are yet

at peace I expect, for I have not heard from them since.

Ibis is the talk that I know, but in a few days I expect

to get more. If they will not take the talks, news will

come day and night." .

Colonel Hawkins immediately sent a force of 200 Lower Creek
warriors from Coweta and Cussetah to Tuclmubatchee which had been
besieged eight days, and under the protection of this force of
friendly warriors, the Creek Chiefs and the inhabitants abandoned
Tuclsaubatcheeuand fled to Coweta, among the Lower Creeks for protection. Soon after Tuckaubatchee was abandoned.-it was destroyed.
with all the property of these friendly Upper Creeks.

Thereafter Coweta, in the Lower Creek Nation, became the headquarters of the friendly Greeks, and all national affairs were carried
on from this‘ place throughout the war, and for some time thereafter.

15, The friendly Indians were almost totally unarmed, while the
hostiles were well armed, and were being supplied with arms and ammunition by the British at Pensacola.‘

15. -A little aid by the United States at this time, to the Creek
National authorities, and the friendly Creeks, which they urgently
requested, might have saved the entire Creek War, and cut short the
activities of the British in this area. However, the United States
gave little or no aid to the friendly Creek authorities. The
difficulties of the friendly Creeks increased, arid the friendly

Chiefs continued to call for aid and assistance from the United

Britain in the War of 1812; and that a group of Greek Indians
made an.attack:upon the town of Tuckaubatchee, the Creek
capital).

17. On.Angust 30, 1813 the hostiles, consisting of about
1000 warriors from thirteen Upper towns, attacked Fort Mime, and
killed nearly all of the inhabitants who had sought refuge there.

l8. Some of the Upper Creek towns did not retreat to the Lower
Creek:Hation, but remained within the Upper Creek country. In Sep—~
tember, l8l3, when the leaders of the hostile party invited thirteen
of the Upper Creek towns to send their warriors against the whites,
stating that their whole number would then be 3000, four Upper Towns—the Fish Ponds, Wewocau, Kialijee, and Hootchoee, answered: “They had
one thousand one hundred warriors, but were not going to fight against
the Americans. The prophets are liars."

19. Colonel Hawkins continued to ask the United States to come
to the assistance of the friendly Creeks.‘ On October 3, 1813, he wrote
Captain.Cook, Commanding Fort Hawkins, that_

‘If the friendly Indians are routed from Coweta,

or, from necessity, constrained to come on terms with

their enemy, the, tter will certainly be on us, and

attempt to verify their threats against the frontiers

of Georgia.“

On October i, 1813, Colonel Hawkins wrote the Secre* “y of

tar as follows:

'Ehe three enclosed letters will -show you the

20. This was the situation when in October, 1813, General

Andrew Jackson, with alarge force, entered the Creek country. On

.'November 3, 1813, General Coffee. fought the battle of Tallassehatchie,

in which he was assisted by a company of friendly Creeks.

On November 9, 1813, General Jackson fought the battle of Talladega,
assisted by friendly Greeks, and relieved one hundred and sixty friendly
Upper Greek warriors, with their wives and children there besieged by
the hostiles.

On November 29, 1813, General Floyd, with 950 militia and friendly
Creeks, fought the battle of duttossee, where the ‘Cox-zetas, under McIntosh,
and: the Tuclsaubatchees, under Mad Dog's son, fought with great bravery.

On December 23, 1813, General Claiborne fought the battle of the
Holy Ground, on the Alabama, no then fell back to Fort Claiborne.

pn January :22, 1811;, General Jackson, assisted by friendly Creeks,
fought the battle of Emckfau, where he was compelled. to retreat.

On January 21%, 1811+, the battle of Enitachopco was fought in which
the friendly Creek Indians again took a part.,

On J'alIL18-1'3’ 27,1811!-, General Floyd fought the battle of Calebee,
and was assisted by 3-100 friendly Indians. 1

On March 27, 1811!-, General Jackson fought the decisive battle of
the Horse Shoe against about one thousand hostiles. A large body of

friendly Indians (600 warriors) tools: part in the action, forda the

stormed the breastworks in front. This battle virtually concluded
% the war within the Greek countr:,r.h

In these battles  of the friendly Creeks were Icilled and o
wounded. They fought with great bravery, L and rendered important
service throughout the x-:a.r._. They were conspicuously brave at the
battles of Anttossee and Ifuo Yaucau.

21.  -April 20, 1.813-I-, Major General Thomas Pinclmey arrived
at Fort Jackson, and, being the senior officer of the southern 
assumed command. General Pinckney had been instructed by the Secretary
of War to make a treaty with the hostile Indians. These instructions

were as follows:
war nemtment, March i7, 1811+.

‘Sir: The policy dictated, as well ‘by the unprovoked, and
unjustifiable conduct of the hostile Creeks, as by a due regard
to the future safety of the Southwestern frontier, may be
brought under the following heads, viz.

_ ‘let. An indemnification (for expenses incu.rred_by
the United States in prosecuting the war) by such cession
,or cessions of land, as may be deemed an equivalent for
said emenses.

. ‘and. _A. stipulation, on their part, that they will
cease all intercourse, with  post, garrison, or
town, and that they will not admit among them, any agent
or trader, who does not derive his authority or license
from the United States.

. _ , 93rd. An acknowledgment ofa right in the United
States to open roads through their territory; to navigate
all waters and streams within the same, and also to establish therein, such military posts and trading houses
as may be deemed necessary and proper. And,

"3-I-th. A surrender of the prophets and other instigators of the war, who will be held subject to the orders
of the President.

‘With these outlines as your guide, you are authorized,
in conjunction with Colonel Hawkins, to open and conclude a
treaty of peace with the hostile Creeks, so soon as they
shall express a desire to put an end to the war.

  have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your
obedient servant, ‘

John Armstrong.‘

Maj or General Pincl-cney.

On March 20, 1813+, the Secretary of War wrote Major General

_Pincl:ney, as follows: 1
‘Sir: Since the date of my last letter, it has

occurred to me, that theproposed treaty with the Greeks

should talce a form altogether military, and be in the

nature of a capitulation; in which case the whole authority of making and concluding the terms will rest \

with you, exclusively, as commanding General. In this

transaction, should it take place, Colonel Hawkins, as

agent, may be usefully employed.”

22. In June, 1811}, the friendly Lower and Upper Creeks were
in a deplorable condition. Many friendly Upper Greek towns had been
burned and the inhabitants were concentrated at Coweta and Cussetah,
where they consumed all of the provisions of the Lower Creeks, they
having escaped with only what was on their backs;

Oil’ the Upper Greeks, the chiefs and warriors of Tuckaubatchee,
about seven hundred, were most faithful to the United States, and the
greatest sufferers; they were the first objects of resentment and
attack from the hostiles; their town was besieged for eight days,
and when removed to Coweta, it was destroyed, with all of their

cattle, hogs, provisions and everything but what they could carry

with them.

of the war having rednced many of the women and children

of the nation to the utmost distress, for want of subsist-ance,

theUnited States will furnish provisions for them at the

Eit. On July 10, 1811!, General Andrew Jackson succeeded General
 in command. He  directed ‘to consummate the arrangements
committed to General Pinckney,' andwas furnished with a copy of the
instructions given the latter. He was to be governed by these instructions, and was given the same power as wasgiven to General
Pinckney.

.25; General Jackson appointed August l, 1811!», for a general
meeting of the chiefs of the Greeks at Fort Jackson. When the time
came, 36 Creel: Chiefs were present-35 friendly Chiefs of both the
Upper and Lower Creeks who had actively aided the cause of the United
States throughout the war, and one hostile Upper Creek Chief.

Jackson presented the draft of a treaty which he had prepared, and
demanded that the Creek Cmefs sigl it. Big Warrior, the speaker of
the Creek Nation, thereafter refused to attend the council, but Jackson
threatened to put  in irons if he did not come. Jackson also told
the chiefs in council that if they did not agree to the terms of the

treaty and the boundaries as prescribed ‘by him, and sign it, he would

furnish the tribe with provisions and ammunition, and they must go down‘

to Florida and Join their enemies, the hostilesand British, and he
would come in a short time with troops and drive the whole of them
into the sea.

The Chiefs asked Jackson that as his powers extended only to ~

retaining as much land conquered from the hostiles as would indenmify the United States for the expenses of the war, upon what

principles he took the lands eastwardly to Georgia, belonging to

the iriendly Indians. Jackson replied that he did it for political
motives -— to prevent intercourse between the Indians and the I
Spaniards and English in ‘Florida, to have a border to separate his
enemies from his friends, which he said was as beneficial to the
friendly Indians as to the United States. The Speaker asked where p
the hostiles were to be placed if Jackson took all their land. He
replied, in substance, “You have room enough to take them among you.“

26. 011 august 7, 18111-', the Speaker of the ‘Nation called upon
Colonel Hawldns for advice stating:

‘We are again in trouble and have need of your
advice; the terms of peace offered by General Pinckney
are disregarded by General Jackson, as we understand.

He loob thro‘-' our country and marks his line, disregards everything we say. He came to treat with the
Hostiles and take as much of their country as would

pay the expenses of the War; this is right, if the whole
is necessary, and he leaves them to starve, it is a thing
‘of their own seeking. The Gene:-al's line takes the hunting grounds of us upper friendly Creeks ‘between Cossaz.

‘ and Tombigbee and between this and Pensacola. It takes
from the friendly Indians the lands between Konecan and
Georgia, eastwardly. His treaty has but one side to it,
and we got nothing. We are afraid of the Hostiles, we are
alarmed at our situation. The Gene@ has done much for
us and we wish to do something for him, he has saved. our
lives, and how can we remse what he demands. This land
of the Friendly Indians is more than enough to pay for
our losses, we are not asking’ him for anything, we only
want as pay for individuals, out of our own funds, and
that on the offer of General Pincicney. One thing we do
not understand, General Pinclcney ranl-cs Jackson, and yet
the latter cannot fulfil the promses of the forms ; you
know the friendly Indians did not half of then lose
property. But some of us lost all. '

‘Washington sent you here; he is dead. and gone,
but you our friend lives, we come to you. You know the
Hostiles are not here, they are gone to Pensacola. How
can the General settle with them, they are not ready
for peace ? You know Cussetau and cowetaw are um-mau-—

.'1?he Government of this nation are here, and have been
friendly and mean to be so. We could settle matters with
the General without the 'Redsticks° , as if they were here,
you know they were not masters of the land to dispose of
it. They have their hunting grounds which every town has.
The General says what he will have, and suppose he will
take it."

Colonel Hawkins advised them to sign the treaty and submit their
protest with it, if General Jackson did not accede to their requests.

27. On August 8, 1813+, the Speaker of the.Hation asked Jackson
to give them back some lands west of the Coosau to accommodate Arbeka,
a friendly Upper Creek town, but Jackson refused this request.

Ethns the friendly Creek Chiefs, composing the Creek National
Council -— _the Government of the Creek Nation -- the allies of the
United States throughout the war, could do nothing but submit to the
demand of General Jackson, which they did u.nder protest. The Chiefs
asked Colonel Hawkins to embody in'the protest the following points:

" "‘ 5 They say in the instrument to convey their
intentions expressed this day, it must be plainly ex.pressed which are the towns masters of the land; that

they have been uniformly friendly to the United States,

and faithful to their engagements in peace and war; that

they consider the extending the line thro“ their lands
in the Lower Creeks, as taking fromsthem more than the

-equivalent offered, and they have claims which should be
attended to, but as the General has no powers about them
they will sign the line with him, it being demanded by
him and advised by their friend Col. Hawkins.“

General Pinckney to Colonel Eawkzins dated April 23, 1811;, and

Colonel Hawkins’ reply of April 2.5, 1811}-, they asked to be forwarded
to the President as their part of the treaty, is as follows:

‘We the undersigned chiefs of the creek Nation

now assembled at the treaty held ‘between the Friendly
and Hostile Indians of the one part , and Major General
Andrew Jackson for the United States of the other part
make known to all whom it may concern, that Gussetau

and Cowetan are the head towns of the Greeks, and with
Toolmnhatchie and Ooseooche the owners of the Creek lands,
and call ourselves, as we are, masters of the land. We
have adhered faithfully in peace and war to our treaty
stipulations with the United States. Finding that General
Jackson in drawing the lines around our country to retain
as much of that conquered from the hostile Indians as he
deemed. just, found it necessary for political motives and
purposes to run a line from Ofocshee through our lands
which commences on the dividing ridge ‘between the waters
of the upper and lower Creeks to Ghattahouchie and thence
eastwardly to the ‘boundary of Georgia, within which there
is a great quantity of lands actually our property, for
which he as an equivalent leaves to the conquered Indians
lands between Coosa and Tallapoosa. We do not deem the
exchange an equivalent. It shall not however interfere
with the running the line, as we rely on the justice of
the United States to cause justice to be done us, and on
these conditions.

We request, that Genl. Pinclmeys letterof the
23d hpril to Col. Hawkins and the answer thereto of the
25th he sent on with the treaty, which we will sign after

; delivering this instrument.

‘let. Wishing to give a" national mark of gratitude
to Maj. G-enl. Andrew Jackson for his distinguished services
rendered at the head of the army from Tennessee - we give
and grant to him and ms heirs forever, three miles square
of land, at such place as he may select, out of the retained

lands.

' '2d. Our nation feel under obligations to Col.
Benjamin Hawkins our agent, and to Mrs. Iavinia Hawkins
his wife, for the unwearied pains they have taken both
of them for a long time, to introduce the plan of civilization among us, and to be useful to us; and as their
children are ‘born in our land, we as a token of gratitude
give and grant to Col. Eau3e:i.ns for himself and his wife
and children, three miles square of land to him and his
heirs forever to be located in such part of the retained
land as Col. Hawkins may select, in one tract, or sul'VC:«’3

to be instigated to violations of their national honor,

and the respect due to a part of their own nation faithful

to the United States and the principles of honmnity, by
impostures (impostors,) denominating themselves Prophets,
and. by the duplicity and misrepresentation of foreign
emissaries, whose governments are at war, open or understood,
with the United States. Uherefore, ‘let. The United States demand an equivalent for all
expenses incurred in prosecuting the war to its termination,
by a cession of all the territory belonging to the Creek
Nation within the territories of the United States, lying
west, south, and southeastwardly, of a line to be run and
described by persons duly authorized and appointed by the
President of the United States —- Beginning at a point on
the eastern bank of the Coosa river, where the south boundary
line of the Cherokee Ration crosses" the same; running from
thence down thelsaid Coosa riv_er with its eastern bani: according to its various meanders to a point one mile above
the mouth of Cedar creek, at Fort Williams, then east two
miles, thence south two miles, thence west to the eastern
bank of the said Coosa river, thence down the eastern bani:
thereof according to its various meanders to a point opposite
the upper end of the great falls, (called by the natives
Uoetumlca.,) thence east from a true meridian line to a. point
this north of the mouth of Ofucshee, thence south by a like
meridian line to the mouth of Omcshee on the south side
of the,Talla.poosa river, thence up the same, according to
its various meanders, to a point where a direct course will
cross the same at the distance of ten miles from the mouth
thereof, thence a direct line to the mouth of Summochico
creek, which empties into the Chatahouchie riveruon the east
side thereof below the EufanJ.a.u town, thence east from a true
meridian line to a. point which shall intersect the’ line now
dividing the lands claimed by the said Creel: Nation from those
claimed and owned by the State of Georgia: Provided, nevertheless, that where any possession of any chief or warrior of the
Creek Nation, who shall have been friendly to the United. States
during the war, and taken an active part therein, shall be within the territory ceded by these articles to the United States,
every such person shall be entitled to a reservation of land
within the said territory of one mile square, to include his
improvements asnear the center thereof as may be, which shall
inure to the said chief or warrior, and his descendants, so
long as he or they shall continue to occupy the same, who shall
be protected by and subject to the laws of the United States;
but upon vol'u_nta_1'y abandonment thereof, by such possessor or
his descendants, the right of occupancy or possession of said
lands shall devolve to the United States, and be identified
with the rights of property ceded hereby,‘

taining to then, by his Secretary Mr. Cassidy, who was
with him, well acquainted with what is done, and is worthy
byuhis intelligence and correct deportnent of the confidence reposed in him, I have but little to add in this
communication. Had it’ not been for the friendly attention
of the Chiefs who call themselves the owners or masters

of the land and are so and who have adh ered faithfully

difficult to execute his commission as there was ‘cut one

 "Fa.naticism which commenced its baneful acts, by destroying the old chiefs and actually destroyed 23 in quick
succession alarmed the survivors and threw them on me for

.-(mthe aid of the United States, to preserve their lives and
possessions. The distinguished bravery of General Jackson
the series of uninterrupted victories obtained by the army
under his command, inspired the Chiefs with a confidence in
the General, which they have endeavored to express by an act
of national gratitude, as sell as the ‘emphatic declaration
he had saved their lives. (Underscoring supplied). t is
due to the occasion, and to truth, to add, that the manner
in which the agency forlndian Affairs has been conducted
for several years, has inspired a confidence in the justice
of our Government not to be shaken by adverse fortune, and I
have cooperated with the General with effect to further the
views of Government. I have advised them and they have
followed it, to accommodate us with the line through the lands
of the Lower Creeks. If General Jackson had had authority it
is not unlikely, a more convenient accommodation would have
accrued to ‘Georgia. I feel that the Chiefs by their confidence in the justice of the U. S. will not have to reproach

Fort Jackson consists of lands in Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi.

Different officials have given the acreage in varying amounts. The
smallest acreage given is that by Indian Commissioner L. Lee. in a
report to the Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs of date

January 17, 1353, as follows:

In Alabama I ll.-l,281L,8OO acres
In Georgia a 7,081!-,80O acres
In Mississippi 1!-00,000 acres

‘over 21-l/_2 millions acres of land.‘ Of these lands ceded he
reports as being occupied exclusively by the i‘riendly Lower Creeks
in Georgia and southeastern Alabama 8,S1¥9,91-10 acres. Ho battles
of the war irere fought in the territory claimed as being occupied
exclusively by the friendly Lower Creeks .i

@311». The lands ceded to the United States by the treaty of
Fort Jackson greatly exceeded in value the total cost of the so-_
called Creek Var to the United States. .

35. The Treaty of Fort Jackson was ratified by the Senate of
the United States and proclaimed by the President on February 16,
1815. No compensation has ever been provided to the Creek Nation
for any lands ceded thereby.

In a Council of the Creek Chiefs at ’l‘u.c3saubatc'nee in September,

1815, the Fort Jackson Treaty was presented and read to the Chiefs,

 ilhe subject of this forced treaty was afterwards frequently

discussed in the Creek Nation, andthe chiefs agreed that their only
remedy was to apply to the President for relief. In 1817 William
Mclntosh, with other Creek chiefs, was sent to Washington for this
purpose but with no result. ‘ I

37. In the year 1832, a. delegation of the chiefs of the Creek
Hation, of which Opotheyoholo was one, went to Washington to hold an
interview with General Jackson, then President of the United States,

in an attewt to obtain compensation for the land taken under the

treaty of Fort Jackson in 1811;. General J ackson told them that he

their people remained east of the Mississippi; that they could

not live peacefully, surrounded. as they were by the white population, and under the jurisdiction of the laws of Alabama; that

as soon as the tribe should, by treaty, cede the lands they then S
held, and move west, their grievances would be listened to, and
all their claims, including this one, should be paid, but that
nothing in the way of settlement could be made until this was done.

38. In the year 18342, and after they had emigrated to the

% vest,Captain Hitchcock, United States Army, as an agent of the

' Government, visited the Creek nation and called _a council of the
tribe for the purpose of ascertaining the nature and character of
their claims. They told him of their ‘claim for lands taken from
them under the treaty of Fort Jackson, which had never been paid for
and gave him a list of various other claims for property lost and
destroyed. in the War of 1812-1811!». However, nothing was done in
regard to the matter.

i.39‘. In l853 the Creek Ration sent a delegation to Washington
for the purpose -of obtaining a settlement of this claim. ‘A. printed
Memorial was submitted to Congress, and the Committees of Indian
Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Senate made a
thorough investigation of this claim, and reported favorably on it.

7-10. (1) The Treaty of August 7, 1856 (11 stat. 699; 2 Kapp.
755) provided in part as follows:

“Article 5. The Creek: Indians do hereby absolutely

(2) The above treaty was executed under’ the following
circumstances; i

Under treaty provisions the United States had moved the
Seminole Ration irom lands east of the Mississippi and located them
on apart of the creek domain in Indian Territory, where they were
to become a constituent part of the Creek Ilationssubject to Greek
Laws. (Seminole Treaty of May 9, 1832, 7 Stat. 368, 2 Kapp. -31s1+;
Cree1r_§ea»ty of January 1+, 18145, 9 Stat. 821, 2 Kapp. 550)., Disputes
-arose, between the two nations, and ‘in December, 1855, the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs directed that both nations send delegates to Washington for the purpose of emencipting the Seminole Nation from the Creek
Ration, and securing a cessiony of creek lands for the Seminoles.

(3) Delegates from both.Ha.tions arrived in May, 1856, and
mbmitted for settlement their claims against the United States. The
claims of the Greeks totaled approximately $14-,UOO,OO0, including
claim for 8,839,911-O acres of land located in Georgia and southeastern

 and claimed by the Creeks to have been exclusively occupied

by friendly Creeks, such claim for said acreage being in the amount
of $1,769,930»

At first the Commissioner refused to consider any claims
other than those having to do with the Seminole controversy. The
Creel: delegates advised the Commissioner that if they should make
another treaty without attempting to settle all their ‘claims, that
such action would meet with great objection on the part of the tribe.
For this and other reasons they insisted that the Commissioner reconsider his decision to consider the Seminole question alone and
consider all their claims. 0

(ll) The Commissioner then asked the Creek delegates what
they would take for their claims. When the delegates submitted
their views, the Commissioner vigorously attacked the validity of
all the Creek claims, referring to them as “alleged claims“ and
‘supposed wrongs,‘ and further stated that the claims were wholly
without merit. He particularly attacked the Fort Jackson Treaty
claim, advising the delegates that there was no merit to it, although
he  before him the report of hispredecessor, Commissioner Iuke
Lea, and the opinions of the Committees of Indian Affairs of both
Houses of Congress, ‘and his own report of two years before, all
favorable to this claim.

 While the Commissioner strongly disparaged their
claims, he offered them $700,000 for a cession of Greek lands for
the Seminoles and for nearly $4,000,000 worth of their claims.

The Creek: delegates rejected this offer as neither fair, nor just,

and much less liberal. The Commissioner then secured an opinion

(7) In submitting the executed treaty the Commissioner of
Indian Affairs advised the Secretary of the Interior that the Creek

claims exceeded in amount $3,700,000 and that in his opinion they

were ‘generally not well fotmded" and that the Creek delegates finally

acceded to the proposition he made them.
