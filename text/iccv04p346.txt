. -‘.Footpaths, formerly Indian traces, criss-crossed most of the New
Purchase Area. These became the lines of subsequent wagon roads and
railroads. Practically all of the New Purchase was readily accessible
to emigrants, and at the.sane time provided avenues of commerce east,
west and south. Because of its location with respect to the Wabash and
Ohio Rivers, and Lakes Erie and Michigan, Indiana was in the direct
path of western commercial growth. .Area 99 was drained by streams
through virtually every township. Many streams were suitable for the
operation of mills.

with the exception of a small area of natural prairie in the northwestern portion and a very small area of marsh and swamp lands, the New
Purchase consisted of wooded lands with occasional "openings" or meadows.
These lands may be classified into six general types, and the acreage in
each type has been estimated. lhree of these classifications--bottom
lands, level to undulatinc uplands, and rolling uplands--were at the

time of the cession considered by prospective settlers the most desirable

categories of land from the viewpoint of fertility and topography. These

ithree classifications comprised approxinately 91% of the New Purchase area.

Most fertile, and most in demand, were the bottom lands, even though

Approximately 5% consisted of hilly uplands, which were considered
less desirable and were settled less rapidly3 but were acceptable.
Approximately 3% comprised the so-called natural prairies. These were
the Wee Plains at the bend of the Wabash River in the northwestern part
of the New Purchase. Unlile the treeless prairies of Illinois and Iowa.
the Wea Plains contained clumps of trees and the soil was not difficult
to plow with the implements then available. The natural prairie lands
were highly fertile and were rapidly settled. Less than l% of.Area 99
were marsh and swamp lands, which required reclamation.

The type of soil, the topography of the land. nd the kind of trees
which it supported were interrelated. The wooded areas abonnded with
oak, hickory, black walnut, beech, sugar maple, elm, locust, and many
other kinds of trees.

The types of land, topograpny, general location, and approximate

acreage of each typej are as follows:

7. Most of Indiana is distinctly smooth and no considerable
part of it is really rugged. All was glaciated except about 6,000
square miles in the southwestern part of the state. All of.Area 99
was subjected to both the lllinoian and Wisconsin glaciers with exception of small segments along the southeasterly and southwesterly
boundaries. Essentially, Area 99 is level with some gently rolling
land along the southeasterly and northwesterly boundaries with a
segment of moderately hilly to rough land on the southwesterly boundary near the southern tip or point.

While much of the land was said to be "poorly drained," the
settlers knew that all forest land in the northwest tended to be
wet in its original state. They also knew that by clearing the forest
the water stored in the leaf mold would be evaporated and run off,
leaving as fine soil as was to be found anywhere in the northwest;
that practically all of the area was tillable, is evidenced by the
fact that 91.7% of the area was settled in twenty years, and its
population outstripped the population of all other areas in the northwest.

Ofcourse, the effort of clearing the land had to be faced in a
typical midwestern climate, which is to say one of fairly severe
winters and hot summers. Averages may be taken and the climate

below zero have been recorded at Lafayette, Paoli and Jeffersonville,
the latter two in the southern part of the state. Defendant‘s Appraiser
tarrett says:

“?he land was heavily forested with good timber and good
soil. In general the terrain was level to gently rolling
w'th about lO% of the area rough and hilly. Each of the
level land was wet in rainy seasons, but in general there
was very little of the area in which there would not be
found ground adequate for home sites, even though such
sites might not be suitable for extensive farming. The
climate was favorable, with no extremes of heat or cold,
and the rainfall was adequate for agriculture. There were
limited roads or trails in the area appraised. The Eabash
River had been a well-used waterway for many years, although
it was apparent at the time that it was not adeqnate for
uninterrupted steamboat traffic. The White River, its
tributaries, and the tributaries of the habash, were usable
as routes of access, but not suitable for commercial trans»
portation."

Other contemporary expressions include:

Samuel Whedon, settler (1817):

"The Indian lands [the New Purchasé7 will be shortly sold
and the best lands in the United States for soil, water, timber,
It will command the lake trade and the southern water trade."

‘William Darby, gazetteer (l8l8):

"It may be doubted whether any state of the United States,
all things duly considered, can present more advantages than
Indiana. Intersected or bounded in all directions by navigable
rivers or lakes, enjoying a temperate climate, and an immense
variety of soil. New two-thirds of its territorial surface is
yet in the hands of the Indians, a temporary evil that a short
time will remedy.”

The Cincinnati Gazette (l8l8):

"To the state of Ohio and Indiana these acquisitions are of
immense importance. In a few years their almost interminable
forests will be converted into flourishing towns and villages
and cultivated farms; the silent footsteps of the savage will
give way to the resounding of the axe, the din of industry, and
the bustle of commercial enterprise.”

The Detroit Gazette (1818):
"With respect to Situation, climate, and fertility of soil,
the country n n acquired is probably equal to any in the world,

Q

and will settle with great rapidity."

Caotain James Riley, Government surveyor (1819):

&

"These lands are charmingly situated in point of climate,
their soil is mostly of the very first gnality—~the country is
well watered and well timbered, and lying on or near the Wabash,

has been esteemed by intelligent men, who have often
traversed it in all directions, in point of rural scenery,
a copious supply of pure water, fertility of soil and
security to health, equal to any part of the western

William Forster, minister (1822):

"% % % I think I have not seen in the course of my

9. Other land in the Public Domain in 1818 in the vicinity of
the tract here involved are the following: The so-called Twelve Mile
Strip being Royce Area 72, lying immediately east of.Area 99. It is
a strip of land approximately twelve miles wide from east to west and
sixty-two miles long from north to south, and contains SS8,lh9 acres,
Area 72 was ceded to the United States by the treaty of Ft. Eayne,
September 30, 1809, 7 Stat. H9. It was opened for settlement in
1811. Area 72 and the Greenville lands hereinafter described were
sold through the Cincinnati Land Office, and comprise what is known

as the Cincinnati Land District.

Also what are known as the Greenvillc lands of the Cincinnati
Land District lie immediately east of Royce.Area 72 and twelve miles
east of.Area 99, the land involved herein. The Greenville lands
contain 3,151,299 acres in western Ohio and southeastern Indiana which
were ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Greenville, August 3,
1795, 7 Stat. b9. The Greenville lands were opened for settlement in
l800. The Indiana portion of the Greenville lands. sometimes referred

to as the Gore, contains 651,298 acres.

August 21, 1805, 7 Stat. 91, and was opened for settlement in 18085

Also Area 26, the Vincennes Tract, which lies immediately south»
west of the Harrison Purchase and is some distance from Area 99, It
contains 1,202,262 acres, ceded to the United States initially by the
Treaty of Greenville; its boundaries were confirmed by the subsequent

10. In 1818, when the New Purchase was acquired by the United
States, there were no other lands in the vicinity, or in that section
of the United States, of the Public Domain, which could effectively
compete as to desiraoility with the lands of the New Purchase for prospective settlers.

Southern Indiana, which was below the glacial belt, was on the
whole more hilly and inferior in quality to the lands of the New

Purchase. Much of the better land had been taken up by previous

J.

settlers; in 1818 half ofVArea S6 and a fourth of.Area 71 had been
disposed of. Settlement of the Vincennes Tract had long remained
static, in part because of the presence of the existing French settlew
ments.

The lands of the Cincinnati Land District in Sastern Indiana and
‘Western Ohio, while excellent in quality, had largely been picked over.
In 1818, the Cincinnati Land Office had sold 73.3% of the Greenville
lands (including the Gore), 86.3% of the Gore and S9.h% of the Twelve
Mile Strip. Good lands were available only'frcm prior settlers and
at very high prices.

The more easterly lands of Ohio were inferior in quality to the
lands of the New Purchase. Their settlement was impeded by exploration
and.mishand1ing on the part of land companies in the 18th century;

titles were not clear.

7-13

Northern Ohio, or the hestern eserve, was far behind the
Cincinnati Land District in development. The use of the Great Lakes

had been retarded by troubles with the British and. in l8l8, the

Great Lakes were not comparable to the Ohio River as a transportation
artery. In consequence, the New Purchase was more accessible and
developed at a greater rate than the areas north and northeast of its

Western New York and western Pennsylvania had long been settled
and little good land remained. The settlers who emigrated passed through
these areas to seek the better lands in the westThe blue grass and Pennyville lands in Kentucky'had all been taken
up long before l8l8. The remaining Kentucky lands were mountainous
and of poor quality. Kentuckians emigrated in large numbers to Indiana

Lands further south, suitable only for cotton plantations, did
not compete with the New Purchase.

11. In general, the settlement of the Northwest Territory followed
a pattern.

Settlers followed the most accessible routes and first

settled on the most desirable of the accessible lands. Bottom lands

and the more level uplands were generally preferred. The first settlement of a new area not only increased the desirability of other lands
in the area, but increased the accessibility of adjacent areas. Thus,

as the settled area became more thickly settled, settlement spread out

into the previously unsettled areas.

The settlement of the New Purchase followed this pattern.

12. Between 1787 to 1795, several large tracts of public federal
and state land were sold to individual speculators and land companies.
The prices paid by these companies steadily increased approximately
from 8 cents or 9 cents per acre in 1787 to ho cents per acre in l79S.
The last major speculative purchase of western lands was made in 1795,
when the Connecticut Land Company purchased from the State of Connecticut
about three million acres of land in the western Reserve at hO¢ an acre.
Much of this land was inaccessible at the time of purchase, being
distant from existing settlements, and the market for it had not then
developed. Because of poor choice of lands, ;nprcper financing, mismanagement and, in some cases, fraud, most of the land companies

—d and th re was a popular revulsion against speculators. As

stated in defendant’s appraisal report of Appraiser Starrett:

“The collapse of most of the large land companies, to»
gether with the adoption of a national policy to distrioute
the vast western domain in small parcels at a nominal price,
discouraged private land jobbing schemes. The popular
contempt for land speculators,, however, persisted, so that
statesmen and financiers for many years thereafter refrained
from openly associating themselves with wild schemes of land
development." (From Sakolski, The Great American Land Bubble,

po 53)::
As of 1818 and for many years prior thereto there were no persons

or groups interested in purchasing lands in tracts of the size of

Area 99.
l3. Under the Trade and Intercourse Act (2 Stat. l0?) and by

virtue of the Greenville Treaty of 1795 (7 Stat. k9); the I3diaH t?ib€S

After a public auction at which sales were made to the highest
bidder, by which sales in a particular area were initiated and which
lasted from one to three weeks, lands were subject to private entry at
the minimum price per acre, the buyers locating tracts they chose in the
surveyed areas. Competition among buyers was further minimized in two
ways: (1) by special priorities such as preemption rights granted in thee
Cincinnati Land District and military bounties such as were granted in
southern Indiana to the Canadians who had served in the American forcesg
and (2) by combinations among buyers who had already settled upon or
chosen the location they preferred.

The minimum price thus tended to become the maximum. Authorities
considered this price to be a nominal one. In 1815, the Commissioner
of the General Land Office, Josiah Meigs, who had earlier described the
tract southwest of the New Purchase as of "excellent quality" which
would be "purchased speedily" reported that the fact that about one-sixth
of the area was as yet unsurveyed was unimportant since "the part remaining unsurveyed would not, at public sale, if offered, produce more than
two dollars per acre." A writer cited and quoted by the Government's
appraiser in this case referred to the $2.00 per acre price as "nominal."
Frederick Jackson.Turner, referring to the same minimum price, speaks
of "the great body of land, offered at

so low a price as to be practically

free."

other public lands were marketed, that is, at a minimum price of $2.00
per acre. However, before the land was opened for sale in 1820, Congress
passed new legislation of general applicability which reduced the minimum
selling price of the public land to $1.25 per acre, payable in cash.

This change was effected April 2h, 1820, and the New Purchase was sold to
settlers under the new law.

The considerations which had previously caused the Government
minimum price to be the actual prevailing price with respect to most
Government sales, continued to affect the Government land market. The
Government program had the result generally of permitting the first
person interested in a particular tract to acquire it at the minimum
price. This was done informally for a time by combinations of settlers
or squatters which were tolerated by the Government and it became an
important feature of the Government public land laws in l83O with the
D20). This legislation authorized a settler who had cultivated
part of the lands occupied by him to enter not more than 160 acres upon
payment of the minimum price.

As a consequence, most of the lands in the New Purchase were sold
ior $1.25 Nevertheless, many sales were recorded at prices
which

occurred in l820, l82l and 1822.

only 51,191 acres of the land sold under this Act at the reduced prices

were located in the New Purchase. This was less than l% of the New

Purchase.

15. The change in land policy represented by the Act of April 2h,
1820, was the result of political, rather than economic, considerations.
Throughout the period when the credit system was in effect, there was
a continuing contest in Congress between those who wished to use the
public domain as a source of government revenue and those who wished to
satisfy the desire of settlers for cheap land. The first group sought to
raise the minimum prices; the second group sought to lower them and also
to reliewathe settlers of their obligations to make the balance of their
payments.

The second group for a time was able to hold the price down to a
minimum of $2.00 per acre, and to enact a series of relief acts, extending payment dates and relieving purchasers who were in default.

In fact, the defaults which occurred in Ohio and Indiana were of little
consequence. Purchasers in these areas, although happy to receive indulgence from the government, were well able to pay the four installments
Of $80 which the law required. An exhibit introduced by the defendant
shows that in 1832, after twelve years of sales at the reduced price of

‘The reduction of the price to $1.25 was a political victory for
those who were not interested in obtaining an ecor mic return from the

lands. As stated by defen9int‘s appraiser:

"As is always the case in the body politic, the
pressure from the individual interests of manr
people is greater than the pressure of a few who
s ek that is best for the nation. The members of
Congress seemed loathe to give up the promise of
greater revenue from the public lands at the higher
prices, but they could not resist the demands of the
settler to make it easier for him to acquire or to keep  laflda ”

Eighty acres were sufficient for his purposes--30 or to acres for
crops and the remaining wooded lands for the grazing of hogs and cattle
and for hunting.

The vast majority of land purchasers were responsible persons. They
had money with which to pay the $80.00 required as a down payment on a
l60-acre farm. This money either represented family savings or the proceeds of the sales of their eastern farms. They brought with them to
the site their hogs, cattle, tools, implements and household goods. A
number of settlers were able to meet succeeding payments from the money
which they broughtwith them; the rest were able to raise the requisite
$80.00 a year from the sale of corn, hogs, cattle, maple sugar and ginseng which could be produced or obtained from the land in the first year

of settlement. The settler was essentially selfusufficient and had little

need for money except to meet the installments on the land. His ability

to pay for land was not appreciably affected by general financial conditions or banking facilities.

17. The collapse of the large land companies in the 1790's and the

popular contempt for speculators cited above (Finding l2) retarded speculation in the lands of the northwest territor". Most of these lands were

sold to the people who wished to live upon them and who seldom purchased

nore than the minimum recuired b; law. Large scale speculation, however,

did take place in the cotton lands of the Sout Inflated prices were
paid for cotton plantations, with a result that when the bubble burst

The signs of this depression, caused in large part by excessive
speculation in other areas and unsound financial practices, were not

apparent in Indiana in 1818. Any observer of sufficient discernment to

Q.

predict a depression at that time would also have predicted, from the

history of the economy since the 1700's, a rapid recovery and a continuation of the upward trend. The years 1817, 1818 and 1819 were called by

some historians the Era of Good Feeling.

19. Sales of the public lands in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois jumped

from 256,385 acres in 1813 to 823,26h acres in 181k; passed one million

acres in 1815; and continued to increase annually thereafter through 1819.

For the country as a whole, receipts from the sales of public lands

passed the million dollar mark in 1811. They dropped during the war years

1812 and 1813, but still exceeded annual receipts before 1811. In 181b,

receipts exceeded one million dollars again, and then they rose substantially each ear through 1819 as follows:

through the District and some had previously settled there.

The Greenville lands of thelhstrict, those lying east of the Greenville treaty line, had been opened for settlement in l800. The Twelve

Mile Strip had been opened for settlement in l8ll. In 1818 almost threefourths of the Greenville lands and nearly 60% of the lands of the

Twelve Mile Strip had.been sold through the Cincinnati Land Office under

the public land laws described in Finding 16.

when the District lands were opened for sale, the prospect of rapid

settlement was less favorable than the prospect for settlement of the

New Purchase at the date of its cession. In 1800, when the Greenville

lands were opened, their northern and western borders were Indian
frontiers; the population density in western Ohio was less than three

persons per square mile and Indiana was not settled; neither Ohio nor

Indiana had been organized as a state. In l8ll when the Strip was open

for settlement, its western and northern borders were similarly Indian
frontiers; Indiana was not yet a state; the popnlation<iensity of Indiana

was 1.3 persons per square mile, that of Ohio 5.? persons per square mile,

while that of the Greenville lands had increased to 13a§ persons per square

nile. In 1818, when the New Purchase was acquired, it was surrounded on

the east, south and southwest by areas which had previously been open to
settlement, only its north and northwest borders being bounded by Indian

Land; both Indiana and Ohio had achieved statehood an

Greenville lands; in 1811 the lands of the Twelve Mile Strip were

also open for sale.

These sales have been tabulated and compared. 73.39% of the Greenville lands were sold during the period, representing an average annual
sale of about h%. In the eight years immediately preceding the cession
of the New Purchase, however, the rate of sale had sharply increased.
Almost hO% of the total acreage was sold during this period.

In the Twelve Mile Strip, which was first opened for sale in 1811,
58.6% of the available acreage was sold in the eight-year period.between 1811 and 1818, or an average annual rate of 7.3%. During the same
period, S9.h% of the available unsold acreage of the Greenville lands
were disposed of at an average annual rate of 7.h%.

The defendant's appraiser has undertaken to compute the rate of
sale in other areas, including the Vincennes Tract, a southern tract on
the Ohio River, Area 56 and the Harrison Purchase (see DX 8, pp. 98-112).

8 It may be noted that in computing rates of sale, the defendant considered
the gross acreage of the entire tract as available for sale, without
deducting lands reserved for school grants, private claims and other

lands withdrawn from the market. Qonsequently, defendant's percentages
of land sold are not accurate percentages of land available for sale, and
defendant's computations on rates of sale are lower than the actual per»

1.

centages of sale of availatle land. As heretofore noted, the Vincennes

Pract and the small Ohio River tract selected hr the defendant are sub»

stantially distant from the New Purchase and are altogether dissimilar

to it in quality and character. Area 56 and the Harrison Purchase, while

Orer the eightwyear period, from 1811 to 18183 defendantis ficnres show

23. The lands of the New Purchase were offered for sale in
1820. Of the 7,036,000 acres contained in the area, 6,717,815 acres
were available for sale and sold to settlers. These sales represented
approximately 83,000 separate transactions. The land law then in effect
permitted a minimum purchase of 80 acres, and it appears that few settlers
took more than the minimum acreage; the average sale is less than 82 acres.

Of the 6,717,815 acres available for sale, 6,162,182, or 91.7%
were sold in the 20-year period from 1820 to 1839. This represents an
average annual rate of sale of h.6%.

During the 20-year period, there vas a depression in the early
l820‘s, followed by a period of increasing prosperity which continued until l837 when another depression took place. These cycles,
although reflected in sales for particular years, did not affect the
general upward trend of the demand for land. The annual sales of lands
in the New Purchase for the years in question.sere as follows:

2h. For the reasons stated in Finding 13, the government land

policy tended.to make the statutory minimum a virtual ceiling price
for all lands sold in the first two decades of the 19th centuryo
Since almost any land in the public domain was available at $2000 per
acre, irrespective of quality or location, there was no incentive to

reserved sections was arbitrarily made by section number and without any
reference to the quality or other attributes of the sections reserved.
In-consequence, the reserved sections were of the same quality as the
unreserved sections.

The purpose of reserving the sections, as stated in 1803 by the
Secretary of the Treasury, was "to give to the public a share in the
increasing value of lands."

By Act of March 3, 1805, Congress authorised the sale of the
reserved sections under the existing public land laws, except that the
minimum price was set at $8.00 instead of $2.00. Between 1805 and 1808,
2,972 acres of reserved Greenville sections were sold at the minimum
$8.00 price.

By Act of February 9, 1808, the minimum price of the reserved
sections was reduced from $8.00 to $h.00. Between 1808 and 1818,
116,085 acres of reserved sections were sold at or above the $h.00
minimum price.

The 116,085 reserved acres which were sold from 1808 to 1818
constituted 38.9% of all the reserved acreage available at the tim
of the enactment of the Act of February 9, 1808. This represents
an average annual sale of 3.5%. During the same period, of the
available unsold acreage of unreserved lands, selling at the $2.00
minimum, 6h.l% was sold, or an “verage annual sale of 5.8%.

Since the reserved sections were identical in kind and quality

to the unreserved sections immediately surrourding them, the substantial sales above noted would doubtless not have taken place if

wit; the reserved lands showed that some lands could be sold at $8900 per

and that, where the minimum price is fixed at $h.OO, substantial sales

could be achieved at an annual rate not significantly below tne annual

rate of sale of identical lands selling at half the price. It larther

indicated that, if all of the Greenville lands had been priced at the

price of the reserved lands, and ii the purchasers had been permitted to
take 80maore tracts,1hus making the cost of a farm the sane as the cost
of a léomacre farm at $?oOO, the rate of disposition of the reserved

lands would probably have been substantially increased, and the rate of

disposition of all the Greenville lands might not have been significantly

Between 1801 and 1805, 22,962 acres of Greenville lands were sold
at prices ranging between $2.01 and $6.50.

Even some reserved Greenville sections sold well above the minimum
price of $h.OO, which in turn.was double the minimum price of the unreserved lands. In 1808, 1812 and 1817, 2,h33 acres of reserved lands
were sold at prices ranqing from $h.Ol to $8.00.

In 1811, the year in which the Twelve Mile Strip was open for
sale, 18,373 acres were sold at prices ranging from $2.01 to $7.11.
“These sales were made despite the fact that the auction period in the
Strip was only one week‘s duration. The above minimum sales represented
36.7% of the total acreage (S0,7h0) sold in the year 1811.

The defendant's appraiser has prepared a list of above-minimum
sales for the State of Indiana through 1818. It appears that 65h
separate sales were made at above the minimum price, of which h6 were
at prices of $5.00 and over. Four hundred seventeen of these overminimum sales are reported.to have occurred in the Harrison Purchase,
which was opened for settlement in 1816; E1 of these sales were at pices
of $5.00 or above. While the actual prices and acreage are not reported,
it appears that the over—minimum prices in the Harrison Purchase exceeded
even those in the Twelve Mile Strip.

2?. The sales most free from the influence of the government land

.L.1."‘

policy were the private sales made between settiers. The consideration

paid in these transactions appears from the deed records, which usually

showed the price and the acreaee. In the counties in which deed records

The deed records of three of the four counties which lie principally

within the Strip are still intact. These records deal with lands immem

The larger trees could then be burned or chopped down. A more‘

them.
expensive method was to "cut smack smooth by clearing everything from
grubbs to the tallest trees.“ The cost of the latter method was about
$5.00 per acre in this area.

The cost of a log cabin averaged not more than $5 .

An average 160-acre farm resold in this period would have upon it
a log cabin worth $50.00, and not more than 30 acres cleared (estimating six acres a.year for five years) at a cost of $3.00 per acre.
Allowing even $5.50 per acre for clearing, the total value of improvements would be $215.00, or an average value per acre of $l.hl. If
this sum is deducted from $5.87, the average gross resale price, the
remainder, $h.h6, would represent the price paid for the unimproved land.

On the basis of free sales between settlers in the Twelve Mile
Strip, the market price of the land itself, after deducting improvements,
would average substantially more than $h.00 per acre.

28. Prices higher than the $2.00 per acre minimum were frequently
paid during the public sales period. After that period, $2.00 per acre
remained the prevailing price for the public lands (except for sections
reserved in lands sold through the Ohio land offices). At the same time
and in the same areas, the prevailing prices for good unimproved lands

J._ C

no longer in Government hands were substantially higher. In the years
l8lS to l8l8 first rate unimproved lands in southern Indiana and.western
Ohio were valued at and sold for $’.00 to 3?.00 per acre when.remote
Values increased with settlement. Very high

values were reported for lands close to villeres and towns. Government

h 378

officials anticipated sales in the Harrison Purchase at $6.00 to $8.00
per acre when the land was put on the market in 1816; prices as high
as $30 per acre were realized during the public sales periods

As of l3lS the price range of "good unimproved lands” in the Miami
Country of western Ohio was $h.00 to $8.00 per acre in locations remote
from villages. Unimproved fertile lands in ”tke settled portions“ of
the area averaged $8.00 per acre, while unimproved lands close to the

principal villages were worth $20 to 3&0 per acrea ‘Within 12 miles

of Cincinnati the range of land values was $12 to $30 per acre and these

figures rose to as high as $120 per acre within 3 miles of that
The same values continued to prevail during the ensuing three yearso

36. There can be no doubt, that from the beginning of sales to
1818 and beyond, the United States was attempting to obtain the high
dollar from the sale of its public lands. .The necessity was there. The
essential evidentiary facts follow:

(a). The land Ordnance of May 20, l78S, provided for the survey of
the Northwest Territory and for sale in sections at $1.00 Ptr acre in specie
or evidence of the public debt. The result was substantially nil, infra.

In House Doc. 3, lst Cong., 2nd Sess. of July 20, l790, the Secretany
of the Treasury, Alexander Hami ton, completely analyzed the matter and recommended offerings in small and large tracts at 30¢ an acre, payable in
gold, silver, or evidence of public debt. He recommended practically no credit.

(b). Contrary to Hamiltcn‘s report, the Act of May 18, 1796, provided

system.

The Act of May 10, l800, marked the beginning of the credit

It offered land in sections and half sections at a minimum price of
$2.00 per acre in specie or evidence of the public debt, one-fourth cash
in forty days or the one-twentieth deposit to be forfeited, and onefourth within two, three and four years with interest at 6%. Discounts
of 8% per annum were provided for anticipating any of the last three
payments.

The Act was amended, March 26, 180b, by extending it to the
Indian Territory and providing for sales also in one-quarter sections.
It further provided that interest nou1d.be waived if the installments
were paid on time.

The last important amendment was February 22, 181?, which provided
for the sale of one-half quarter sections, i0»acre tracts, in sections
numbered 2, S, 20, 23, 30 and 33 of every township.

Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin, the financier

Doc. 91, 8th Congress, 1st Session). This report noted:

Lands were being offered at a price much beyond the terms theretofore granted in the several states.

(h). Senate Doc. 2&6, 27th Cong., 3rd Sess. givesg inter alias

the gross sales and gross selling price annually by states from 1800 to

June 30, 1320. Facts from this are:
The peak of settlement, noted by some historians as the Great

Migration, is marked between 1831; and 1818. During this period lands

were selling in Ohio and Indiana at just over the minimum price of $2000

per acre and in Alabama they brought up to $6.00 per acre in 18180
37° The Act of April 2h, 1820 abolished the credit system; reu
duced the minimum price to $1.25 per acre and provided for sales in
whole, half, quarter and half-quarter sectionso
The general Relief and Reliuquishment Act was passed March 23

entire debts were paid before September 30, 1822, not including pay»

dispute that the ventures varied from unsatisfactory to disastrous.

hO. As a matter of private economy, the supply of currency or specie
was meager as compared to the ?,000,000 acres involved and the total
available public acreaee.

l820, the nearest census date, was $69,l00,000.00.

The total currency and money issued and in circulation in

and deposits of $3l,200,000.00, oi which §l6,?00,000.00 was specie. The

Fluctuations in American Business, l?90~1860, Harvard

"Commodity prices in Foston began to drop late in 1818.

The price of United States 3% stock dropped from about

72 in the early spring of l8l8 to 65 at the close of

the year and continued down. Bank stocks at the beginning of l8l8 were 10-11 points below the l802 level and
began to fall from there in the late summer of that year.
60-day hills on London at Boston began a sharp decline in
January of l8l8 and.were below par at the end of the year.
In January and June of 1818 specie levels of the Boston
banks were at their lowest since l8l0.”

with a demand for specie-«much of which was needed for exu

the American merchant even more difficult. On October l9,

the following language:

“A great crisis approaches—-slow in its

new land beyond the mountains, and to see men and women
making the journey thither on foot became a common sight,
and at times a most pitiful one.”

hl. Defendant's Appraiser, Pail Starrett, as to the property in

Question, stated:

"The highest and most profitable use for diich the property is adaptable and needed or likely’to be needed in
the reasonably near future should te considered not neces«
sarily as the measure of value, but to the extent that the
prospect of demand for such use affects the value at the
date of valuation. An immediate demand for such use need
not exist, but the prospect of demand should exist to establish snch use as a measure of value.

“It is obvious that at the time of valuation there was
no use or user that could utilize the tract of over seven
million acres for any single operation, It has been shot‘
that there was at the time a demand for small tracts of
land; therefore, the highest and best use of subject tract

as a whole was for subdivision and resale in small tracts.

"Sales at arm's length of the sane or simi ar property
within a reasonable period 01 the date of valuation
(comparable sales are the best inoica ion of value.

the appraiser must analyze the potential development

possibilities and, by establishing as closely as posm

sible the various items of capital cost, carrying

charges; selling expenses, and potential sales of

small tracts, establish guides from which he can

formulate an opinion as to value.“

defendant‘s Appraise Starrett says:

"Since these sales were in Indiana (the 2,701,500 acres
above listed), they represent the closest comparison to
land in the New Purchase and should be studied very carefully. They present sales to settlers who were seeking
the particular character of land that existed in parts of
the New Purchase. Climate, soil, and timber was the same,

Indiana was admitted to the Union on December 11, 1816.
population of Indiana in 1810 was 2h,S20; in 1815, 63,897; in 1820,
lh7,178. Defendant’s Appraiser Starrett said, "It is reasonable to
assume that this figure was in the neighborhood of 125,000 to 135,000
in 1818 centered in the southern third of the state.“

October 6, 1818, at 20¢ an acre, or $l,L00,000.

(Emphasis supplied)

 

The said witness Starrett evaluated Area 99, as a whole as of

The witness explained how, in the absence of sales of large tracts,
comparable in size, location, character and time, informed purchasers
will, in the light of all past experience and known factors, make estimates of'what the land may reasonably be expected to sell for in the
future, at what prices and over what period of time; what capital cost
can be sustained; what the interest and other carrying charges will
amount to, and what the surveying, selling and other expense may be.

He illustrates his reasoning by computations which.he denoninates
Schedules §l, §2, $3, §h and.§S, found on pages 12b to l3l, inclusive,
of Defendant’s Exhibit 8. Based on the assumptions as shown by said
schedules he arrives at his valuation of the tract at 20¢ an acre, or
$1,hoo,cco.

In no one of these schedules dees the appraiser assume a

sale to a settler of any of the acreage at more than 31,35 per acre;

and in Schedule 5, upon which he bases his appraisal of 20¢ an acre; he
assumes the sale to the settlers of 3/L of the total acreage at $1.10 an
acre and 1/h of the total acreage as non—salab1e (Def. Ex. 8, p. 131).

b5. The petitioners’ appraiser, Berkley'H. Duck, finds the fair
market value of the 7,036,000 acres of land in Area 99 as of October 6,
1e18, to be $13,201,892.68, or $1.876} per acre. Te arrives at this
value by estimating the gross returns from the sales of 90% of the

acreage to settlers at $h.00 per acre and 10% of the acreage at $2.00

per acre, discounted for credit terms at 65. His basis of calculation
and assurptions from which same is arrived at are found at page 7 of
