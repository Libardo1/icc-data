Decided: July 10, 1959

ADDITI ONAL FINDINGS _o_rj FACT

The Commission makes the following findings of fact which are
supplemental to the findings numbered 1 to 29, inclusive, heretofore
made herein:

30. The Commission has earlier in this case decided that_petitioner

herein, The Suquamish Tribe, held aboriginal Indian title to certain lands

, in what is now the State of'Washington which were ceded to the United

,States by the Treaty of January 22, 1855, 12 Stat. 927, and that the
United States extinguished petitioner's Indian title to said lands on
March 8, 1859, the effective date of the treaty (S Ind. Cl. Comn; 157). _i
The lands found to hare been exclusively used and occupied by the Suquamish
Indians are set out in said prior decision in Finding 29. Said lands will
hereinafter be referred to as the subject tract or the Suquamish tract.
This trial has been held to determine the value\of said lands as of
March 8, 1859,

31. (a) Generally speaking the Suquamish tract is an area of land

located in what is now the east central portion of Kitsap County,

‘.:and,August.

7 Ind. Cl. Com. Th? 7&8

‘Washington. The subject tract consists of all of Bainbridge Island and
the eastern portion of the Kitsap Peninsual fronting along ts eastern
border along Puget Sound from Kingston south to a point near South
Colby. The tract is quite rough and broken in surface topography with
numerous hills and ridges rising to 300 and hOO feet. ‘The coastline is
in the main precipitous with numerous stretches of perpendicular cliffs
fronting on the water. The area while in the main fairly watered has
no streams of importance. Drainage is furnished by a number of small
brooks and creeks. The courses of these small streams are short, flowing
from.the encircling high lands directly into Puget Sound.

(b)% The climate of the area is controlled by the moderating influences cf the Pacific Ocean. The winters are mild and the summers

cool. There is an abundance of rain, providing for a damp climate during

the entire year with the exception of a relatively dry period during July

6

32. (a) The acreage of the Suquamish Tract as described in Finding 29

of the Commission's prior Findings of Fact in this case is 88,hl0 acres.

s From.this total acreage a body of land consisting of 1280 acres which was

reserved to the Suquamish Indians by the 1855 treaty is deducted leaving

4

sita pet acreage to be evaluated of 87,130 acres. The land in the subject
.tract is classified as follows:

Accessible Timberland .................... 3l,hl2 acres u
Inaccessible Timberland .................. SS,h28 acres
Bottom or Potential Agricultural Land .... None
 Illnoouosutostoacc00910000000  

(b) The subject tract was a forest region. Prior to the date of
°V3l“3ti°n:'hCWeVer, a large amount of the timber thereon was destroyed

and/or damaged by fire, according to the surveyor's field notes.

33. The slowness of settlement of the Puget Sound area prior to
the 188098 can be attriouted -to its physical inaccessibility and the
lack of tra.nsportation-facilities. as of 1859 all the communities of
westem Washington were virtually dependent upon water transportation.
There were few roads and no railroads in the area. The construction of
railroads west of the 81-Iississippi was delayed until sufficient funds
were available, which funds generally- were derived from the sale of
lands granted the railroad. The first transcontinental rail semce
was to California in 1869. The Northern Pacific Railroad to the West
Coast was completed in 1883 and did not reach the Puget Sound area until
1887.

V8311. By Act of Congress the Territory of Oregon was established
on August lb, 18118 (9 Stat. 323). This territory included the present
States of Oregon, Washington and Idaho. The Territory of Washington

was created by the Act of Congress of Haréh 2, 1853 (10 stat. 172) and

8 included the present States of Washington and ldaho.   The Act or March 3,

1863 (12 Stat. 808) created the Territory of Idaho and established the
eastern boundary of the present State of Washington.  November 11,
1889, Washington was admittedito the Union as a state. 9  8 9 I

35. The first settlers arrived in the Puget Sound "area in 18115,
and in 1851 they established t..e first Puget Sound town, Tune-rater, near
what is now Olympia , Washington. The first settlers in the subject tract
apparently entered the area in 1851; when one sawmill was started ata
point near Kingston on what is‘1<no':~:n as Apple Tree Cove and a small sawmill was constructed at Port Orchard. The population of the area in 1859

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 7&7

is not shown by the evidence but apparently the area was sparsely settled

except for the few persons operating the mills.

Timber ‘

36. The Puget Sound area lies in a band of heavy timber which
covers virtually the entire area west of the Cascade Hohntains. In '
fact, reports indicate that nearly 9/l0ths of'Washington's timber is

in that area.

There is also valuable timber such as red cedar and hemlock.‘ In 1899,

Henry Gannett, Chief of the Division of Geography and Forestry for'thel '

Department of the Interior, reported that "with the exception of the
redwoods of California, the forests of'washington are the densest,
heaviest, and most continuous in the United States. Except for a few

prairie openings, and except where removed by fire or the ax, they

couer the country as‘a thick mantle from high up on the Cascade Range '

eeereerd re the shore of the Pacific." He reported on Kitsap countye‘

0 + This occupies the northern part of the peninsula
_Separating Hood Canal from Puget Sound. It was originally covered with heavy fir forests. These have

‘,C§een removed almost entirely by the ax from the shores

"W and the islands bordering them. Only a trifling area
in the southern portion of the county has been burned,
while nearly half the area has been logged. Then '
Standing timber consists entirely of fir.

o .

3?. In the subject tract there was, taking into account the
destroyed and damaged timber, an average of approximately 9000 board
feet of timber on the accessible lands and 6000 board feet per acre

on the inaccessible lands, made up of the following species and

amounts thereof:

The Douglas fir forms about 7/8ths of the forest growth.“

38. In the early days of our colonial history, the forests were
generally regarded as inexhaustible and were in many instances considered
a liability rather than an asset, since many of the early settlers were
interested in the use of the land for agriculture and grazing purposes
and the clearing of lands for those purposes was a burdensome and ex;
pensive process. That was the attitude of some of the_early Oregon‘Washington settlers where fires were started by them in the forests as
an aid in clearing the land. However, there also existed a recognition
of the need for timber for homes and local industries as well as for
shipbuilding and export. From a commercial standpoint the lumber industry in this country had its beginning in Maine, and gradually ex»
tended along the Atlantic seaboard and then into the Great Lakes region
in 1850. Lumbering operations of any importance did not reach the
Oregon4Washington area until about 1890 to 1900 although shipments of
timber began on Puget Sound around 1850. The earliest commercial uses
made of the vast timber resources were for spars and pilings. ‘The huge
trees were cut by the settlers and dragged to the waters‘ edge to be 8
sold and loaded on ships for transportation to the world markets.

39. The first sawmill on Puget Sound was a small waterpowerzmill
at a site named New Market, now Tumwater, near the present city of
0lympia,'Washington. In September 1852, there were three sawmills in

operation in what became'Washington Territory. Two years later there

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 73.1.7 ' 752

were thirty—three sawmills in operation in'Washingtcn Territory; In
l8SS there were twentyafour sawmills in the Puget Sound area. All the
sawmills were constructed along the waters of the Sound or on the banks
of rivers whose waters could be utilized in transporting the logs as well
as providing power for the saws. The first steam plant sawmill was
Xesler‘s mill built in present Seattle in the winter of l8S2-3. It had
a capacity of 103000 to lS,O0O board feet per day and became the main
industry in Seattle and for years furnished employment for the local
inhabitants.

b0. pThe early lumbering operations were very crude. The logging
was done by manpower. lTrees were felled by'axg which was used until the
early 1880's when the cross-cut saw came into use. The trees were cut
into logs of a length which men could handle and were rolled or dragged
to the nearest water to be floated to a sawmill. Because of the laborious
operation, the tinber was cut slowly.” The timber first cut was that along
the waters of the Sound and those streams which could be used to drive
logs. Even as late at l88O it was reported that the forests along the
shores of Pugetsound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the lower Colum»
bia River had been culled only of the best trees for a distance of only’

one to two miles inland. In the Department of Interior‘s Census Office

Report on the.Forests of North America, by Charles S. Sargent (l88h) ‘t

 

is reported:

The methods adopted by the lumherman of western'Washington territory are wasteful in the extreme. Loggers out only’
timber growing within a mile or a.mile and a half of shores
accessible to good booming or shipping points or which will
Yield not less than 30,000 feet of lumber to the acre. Only’
trees are'cut which will produce at least three logs 2h feet

 

-4? Ind. Cl. Com. 7&7   753

long, with a minimum diameter of 30 inches. Trees are out

not less than l2 and often 20 feet from the ground, in order
that the labor of cutting through the thick bark and enlarged
bases may be avoided, while 12,0 or 50 feet of the top of the tree

are entirel 7 wasted.
1:1. In keeping with the ear..y settlers‘ attitude toward the liability
of seemingly ine$austible forests and his desire to clear land, was the

feeling __of the lumberman who cared little whether the timber he took leg-'

, ally belonged to him or not. Timber was out indiscriminately from a

neighbor‘s land, railroad land, or the public domain; It has been reported that Puget Sound was the center of wholesale timber stealing. In
1861 measures were taazen to suppress this illegal activity and the areas‘
leading lumbermen from Port Gamble, Port Madison, and Seebeck  lumbering centers on the shores of the southern part of Puget Sound) were

indicted. The usual penalty upon a finding of guilty was paj, ..ent for

the land upon which the timber was cut plus a jail sentence of "an hour

ibofwjbllyiico2:1:.s.union" with the court, the prosecution and the defense.

In an effort to prevent spoliation of public timber a charge of $2.50
a thousand was made for timber cut on government land. This "stumpage f ee"
was opposed by mill men of Puget Sound, who felt the price was exhorbitant
since the land, if surveyed, could be offered for sale at'$l.2S per acre.
An agent sent west during the Grant administration found that since 1855
on Puget Sound alone timber to the value of not less than $b,O,CC0,000 had
been stolen from the government. During this period a common term in the
Pacific Northwest was “round forty."  settler would acquire 110 to l6O
acres of land; then he would cut not only the timber on his own land but

on the surrounding land on all" four sides, Before he was through cutting

7 Ind. C1. Com. 71:7 . , 751:

he woLiLd have cut from 160 to 61:0 acres of timber from this governztzent land
in addition to his own 140 to l6O acres.
§._gricultLa'e

1.12. (a) The amount of good agricultural land in the S_uquami;sh tract
was necligible. This was due to the absence of stream valleys of any importance in the area. Good soil is found only in small pockets of a few
acres along cm courses of the streams.

(b) The 1860 census listed 366 ,lS6 acres in the Washington Territory
as farmland. This compared with 2 ,O60_,S39 acres of farmland in Oregon
Territory. E1 l8'{O in all of Kitsap County there were only 145 farms con 92 acres of improved acreage and 299 acres unimproved. Kitsap
County contained a total acreage of 257,280 acres. The early history of the
entirezdl-liashington Territory and in particular the Puget Sound area indicates:  the use of land for agricultural purposes was almost ezcclusively
for the subsistence of the settlers. ‘ p

F 621:3. (a). Under the Oregon Donation Act of Septe®er 27, 1850 (9 Stat.

h26)settlers were able to acquire a right toland  the Oregon Territory,
 included. the present State of Washington. The Act originally  2
videdfor grants of 320 acres to single, and 610 acres toumarried, white
settlers who had settled on the land claimed prior to December 1,2 18520.2

The Act required that the settlers live on the land for four years, cultivate and improve it for their own use and not as agent for anyone else;

that no town lots, mineral lands or lands reserved for public purposes could
be selected. I The act liraited the donations to one per person. Actual proof

Of a settler‘s compliance with all the terms of the tract was requred before

7 Ld. Cl. Com. 1%.?   755'

a patent could issue, and no patent could issue until the land was surveyed
'by the government surveyor.

(h) In l85l, 58 entries were made in the Washington Territory under
the Donation Act, and in l552 there were ll? entries. The Preemption Act,,
of September h, l8hl, was made applicable to'Washington in l85h. Under
the Preemption Act, any person who did not own land in the Territory or
who was not the proprietor of 320 acres of land in any other State or Territory, might secure 160 acres of public land at $1.25 per acre provided
the land was surveyed, the Indian title extinguished, actual settlement
‘made with a dwelling erected, and.the settler living on the land. In l859

the total acreage taken in the Washington Territory under the Donation and

Preemption Acts totaled ll,277 and this increased in.l86O to l7,97h acres.

 

The total number of donation certificates and acres of land.granted in
‘Washington and Oregon was:
Oregon -- 7,317 certificates; 2,563,757.02acres

Washington -- 985 certificates; 290,215.35 acres

(c) The Homestead.Act was enacted May 25, l8o2i(l2 Stat. 392) perimitting settlers to acquire farms of 16S acres (or 80 acres on land selling
50? $2.50 per acre) free except for nominal filing fee. The Act required
cultivation, improvements and fire years‘ actual occupancy; _However, any’
Person clai i g .nder the Act could.secure title before the expiration of
the five years by the payment of the minimum price of the land selected
($1.25 or $2.50 per acre).

(5) Public landwcould.also he acquired by the location of military’

1_

land bounty warrants, under the Act of February ll, 18a? (9 Stat. l25), and

of agricultural college scrips, under the Act of July 2, 1862 (12 Stat. 503).

7 Ind. 01. Con. 71;? ~ 756

(e) The Timber and Stone act of 1878 (20 Stat. 89) permitted the sale
of timber lands in quantities not exceeding l6O acres per person and at a
minimum price of €92.50 per acre.

(1') The rate at which land in the subject tract passed from federal to

private ownership up to 1880 was as follows:

 

lO—Year Period Acreage Percent of Total
1860-1869 16,100.99 18.5
1870-_-.1879 8,uo1.82 9.7
Total to 1880 211,502.81 28.2

ML. (a) There is no evidence of any sales of land comparable in size,
character or location to the Suquamish tract prior to l8S9. There were,
however several salesx-zhich were similar in certain respects to the land
involved in this case. lhe Pope and Talbot firn, the Puget Hill Company,
was one of the earlypurchasers oft tracts oi‘ timber land. ' This company
was one of the largest sawmill companies with a miillat Portdazrzblei on em
western side ofthe Sound. Under the Act creating the Washington Territory,

two tonnships oi‘ land were allowed for financing the University. The land

 be sold for not  than'$l.SO per acre.88 Pope  were per to select the bestof this University land  the records show 

purchases of 787.75’ acres in 1861; 565.50 acres in 1862; and 17,1450 acres

in 1353, all ‘at a purchase price of $1.50 per acre. ‘The land so purchased
was choice, accessible timberland, not more than a mile to a mile and a half
from the shoreline of the Sound and within the immediate vicinity of the
Port Gamble mill. Pope and Talbot also utilized military scrip to acquire
17,398 acres in 1863 but the exact price paid cannot be determined. The

Puget Hill Company purchased 2 ,8l:,9.7S acres in Island County for about

 

7 Ind. 01. Corn. 714'? . 757.

$1.05 per acre in l866, From l87S through the l880?s, Pope and Talbot
purchased numerous l60-acre tracts on a selective basis within a mile and a
half of salt water at about $3.12 per acre, with an occasional purchase
slightly above or below this figure.

(b) The first sale by the Northern Pacific Railroad Company was. in
December, l872, when it sold 2h.69 acres north of Kalama on the Columbia
River at a price of $5.00 per acre. The first sale of more than 200 acres
‘was in.May of l87h. That involved a tract of 590.36 acres on the-Nisqually
Plains which sold for $3.15 per acre. From July l, l883, until June 30?
188k, the railroad sold a total of lh7,hS0.h9 acres in'Hashington for $h.70
per acre.

(c) pThe first large purchase of Washington timber land was made on
J3nH3rY'3l, 1900; when the famous Weyerhaeuser Timber Company purchased
900,000 acres of the finest'washington timber land from the Northern Pacific

for a price of $6.00 per acre. Of the 900,000 acres so purchased none wast

in the subject tract or in Kitsap County.
T * k5. The highest and best use for which the Suquamish lands were
adaptable as of March 8, 1859, was tinber production.
H5. There was no mineral deposits of any'importance known to be
present on the Suquamish tract as of Harch.8, l8S9.
b7. (a) Mr. James.A. Orutchfield, a Professor of Economics at the
University oT'washington, appeared as a witness for petitioner. This
‘witness testified that he use two methods of evaluating the subject tract.
The first method.he used to determine value was on the basis of the actual

commercial.use which land.night have and secondky he used.a method to

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 7L=,7 - 758

arrive at a “subsistence valuation."

(b) Mr. Crutchfield in his report states (Pet. Ex. la) that he arrived at his estimate of value based on the actual commercial. use which the

land might have by following the procedure outlined in earlier cases. The

 

cases referred to by petitioner’s witness are the Nooksack Tribe v. United

States, 6 Ind. Cl. Comm. 578, and I-Iuckleshoot Tribe v. United States, 6 Ind.

 

01. Comm. 608. In these prior determinations this Commission set forth fully‘
in its findings of fact the methods used by the nitness and in its opinions
stated Mr. (k‘utchfield‘s, opinion of value could not be givenmuch weight
since his method of valuation was not in accordance with legally approved
standards but rather involves methods based onconjectureiand speculation,

“which methods have been specifically rejected by the courts and this

_Conm1ission." 1%. Crutchfield's opinion based on his "subsistence value"

method was rejected in theseprior cases as being, entirely theoretical

and as one not based upon any judicially accepted method of evaluating land.
; 1&3. Mr.‘ 0. Marc Miller, a qualified appraiser of Seattle, Washington, testified as an expert witness for defendant and prepared a written

ivaluationreport (Def. Ex. 205-A).which contains a wealth of material pertaining to the subject tract. Mr. Miller used as his yardstick in reaching
his opinion as to value the fair maket value approach. l3efenda_nt‘s apPraiser took into consideration the many factors considered in evaluating
lands such: as the sizes of tm tracts, accessibility, surrounding sales,
33x93: transportation, population, demand for land, markets, financial investment, risks and need for a return on investment and profit. Degfendant’s

witness was of the opinion that the full fair market value of the subject
tract as of Earch 8, 1859, was the sum of $900,000 or at the rate of approximately $0.10 per acre.

£9. Upon the basis of the findings of fact herein made, and the record
as a whole, the Commission.finds the Suquamish tract, consisting of 87,130
acres, had a fair market value as of March 8, 1859, of $78,500.00, or at

the average rate of approximately 90 cents per acre.
