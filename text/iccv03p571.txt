FINDIRGS OF EAST _

The Commission makes the folio-sing findings. of fact:

1. The individual; petitioners named in the title represent the
Nez Perce Tribe of Indians and are authorized by the Indian Claims
Commission Act to prosecute the claim set forth in the petition.

2. In December 1853, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for
Washington Territory, Isaac Stevens, recommended to the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs that the Indian title to land east of the Cascade
Mountains should be ertingnished as.soon as possible (Pet. Ex. 31).
In March 1851:, Stevens notified A. J. Bolon he was to be agent for
certain tribes and to act jointly as agent for the Nez Perce. Stevens
instructed Bolon as to how he was to handle the Indians and to prePae the say for negotiations with the Indians. Bolon was also in-3

strncted to tell the Indians that Stevens had recommended that the

Government purchase their lands and that whites should be permitted

3577to settle peaceably for the Indians could be assured that they would be
justly Paid for their lands. (Pet; Ex. M0).

3. By the Act of July 31, 1351; (10 Stat. 315, 329-330), 1;5,ooo was
appropriated for the expenses of negotiating treaties with the Indian
tribes in the Territory of Washington. (Pet. Ex. Rh). Stevens was
appointed as Conmissioner to negotiate with the tribes to purchase their
lands and was instructed to concentrate the Indians on a limited number
of reservations. On May 28, 1855, at Walla Walla, Washington Territory,
Stevens and Superintendent Palmer of Oregon Territory commenced a council
with the Hes Perce and other tribes of those territories including the
Yakima, Walla‘Walla, Uhatilla and Cayuse Indians. The Council lasted
nany days. The N32 Perce were willing to sell their lands but wanted to
be assured that whites would be kept off their reservation. The Commissioners explained that by going on the reservation the government could
do more to protect the Indians and to preserve peace. The Commissioners
assured the Nez Perce that no whites would be permitted to go on the reservation.but the agent and the persons.enployed by the agency; (Pet. 33;
53. pp. 10, 18, 19, 26, 36, 141;, 1+5, 1:6, M7),

M. This tribe claimed a.large area of land located in parts of what
are now the States of Oregon, Washington and Idaho, and by the Treaty of
June ll, 1855, 12 Stat. 957, they ceded to the United States all such
lands, which are described in Article 1 of said treaty, and by.Article 2
thereof reserved from such ceded lands, for the use and occupation of
said tribe and other friendly tribes and bands of Indians in Washington

Territory a tract of land described as follows:

K:-I

' - - ;\<i

Commencing where the Mob ha—ne-she or southern tributary
of the Palouse River flows from the spurs of the Bitter Boot
Mountains; thence down said tributary to the mouth of'the
Ti-nat-panrup Creek; thence southerly to the crossing of the
Snake River ten miles below the mouth of the Al—po-warni
River; thence to the source of the.Al—po-warni River in the
Blue Hountains; thence along the crest of the Blue Mountains;
thence to the crossing of the Grand Bends River, midway between
the Grand Bonds and the mouth of the Woll-low~how River; thence
along the divide between the waters of the Well-low-how and
Ponder Rivers; thence to the crossing of the Snake River fifteen
miles below the mouth of the Powder River; thence to the Salmon
River above the crossing; thence by the spurs of the Bitter Boot

Mountains to the place of beginning.
(b) Said.Article 2 also contains this provision:

All which tract shall be set apart, and, so far as necessary,
surveyed and marked out for the exclusive use and benefit of said
gtribe as an Indian reservation; nor shall any white man, excepting
those in the employment of the Indian Department, be permitted to
reside upon the said reservation without permission of the tribe
and the superintendent and agent; and the said tribe agrees to
remove to and settle upon the same within one year after the

ratification of this treaty.
(c) Article 11 of said treaty contains this provision:

This treaty shall be obligatory upon the contracting parties
as soon as the same shall be ratified by the President and Senate

of the United States.

(The treaty was ratified on I-{arch 8, 1359, and proclaimedon April 29, l859).

(d) Article 3 provided that roads might be run through the reservation if necessary for the public convenience and the'use of the Clear'water River and other streams flowing through the reservation was secured

to citizens of the United States for rafting purposes and as public highs

ways.

(e) No other Indians but Nez Perce occupied said reservation.
5. Following ratification of the Treaty of June 11, 1855, Agent Gain

caused a notice to be posted warning all persons not to attempt to trade

with the Nez Perce without a license and he informed the Indians in July,
1859 that whites were not allowed to live on the reservatien and that some
whites had been removed therefrom. (Pet. Ex. 121, 123) .

6. In the fall of 1860, a small party of whites intruded upon the
reservation in search of gold. The Nez Perce Agent attempted’ to have them
removedby the military who refused to act unless the intruders stopped to
work on the reservation. By the time the military "undertook to act, snow _
blocked the attempt to reach the miners. The agent to quiet the Indians
assured the Indians that the military would be sent in the spring to remove
the miners. (Pet. Er. 189). During the winter, whites continued to intrude

on the reservation. (Pet. E1. 178). By March 1861, some 1800 claims had

been prospected although not more than 5 or 6 of these were being operated.

(Pet. E::.‘18?+)._ _ - , 2  _ As a result of the chaotic conditions existing on the reservation

7.

resulting from the gold rush and to avoid a threatened uprising, an agreement rras entered into on April 10, 1861, between the Superintendent of
Indian Affairs for Oregon and Washington on behalf of the United States
and the chiefs and head men of the Nez Perce tribe, as follows:

1. That portion of the Nez Perce reservation lying north

of the Snake and Clearwater rivers, the" south fork of Clearvrater
and the trail from sai<_i south for}: by the ‘Weipe root-ground,
across the Bitter Root mountains, is hereby opened to the whites
in common with the Indians for mining purposes, provided, hosever, that the root-grounds and agricultural tracts in said 7
district shall, in no case, be taken or occupied by the whites,
but shall remain for the exclusive use and bene.f.'it of the Indians.

2. No white person, other than those in the service of the
United States, shall be permitted to reside upon or occupy any
portion of the Hez Perce reservation south of the line above
described, without the consent of the superintendent, agent,

and tribe, except that the right of may to the mining district
north of said described line may cross Snake river at any
eligihle point below the mouth of Clearwater.

3. ffhe entire portion of the Nez Perce reservation hereby

opened to the whites for mining purposes, shall in all respects

be subject to the laws of the United States regulating trade and
intercourse in the Indian country; and no person shall be permitted to trade therein without obtaining license and giving bonds
as provided by law. H. It is further agreed on the part of the United_States that
a sufficient military force shall be placed on the reservation to
preserve the quiet of the country and protect the Indians in the
rights secured to them by treaty and these articles of agreement.
.(Pet3 Ex. 182).

In reporting this agreement to his superior, the Commissioner of Indian

idffairs (Ex. 183), Superintendent Geary, one of the signers, stated:

‘f * the enclosed Articles of Agreement were entered into unanimously by
all the chiefs and headmen present. No considerable number pas absent
and these stipulations may be regarded as haying received the approval
of the entire tribe.”

The above agreement was.made pursuant to the provisions of Article 2
(Finding 2(b)) by uhich.the tribe permitted white men to enter upon
roughly the northern half of the reservation for mining purposes. However, rich placer mines were later discovered and operated south of the
Clearwater Biver‘s line.

8. Following the Agreement of April 10, 1861, a company of soldiers
‘was sent to the reservation to undertake the duties required by Article

'5
-G

M of the Agreement. The presence or this company helped to preserve

peace and quiet on the reservation by preventing intrusion on the root
The

grounds of the Indians and in suppressing the whiskey traffic.

presence of the military,.however, utterly failed to confine the miners

3 575

to north of the Glearwater River as required by the agreement, for in
August 1861 it was reported that prospecting had been going on and rich
mines discovered south of Clearsater; (Pet. Exhibits 192, 198. and 200).
Some five to seven thousand whites were reportedly on the reservation in

September, 1861. j
9. In November 1861, Superintendent Kendall, who replaced Geary, reported to the Commdssioner of Indian.Affairs that at the junction of the

Snake and Clearwater rivers a town had been laid out and a record for lots

established under the tacit approval of the former Superintendent and the

Agent for the Nez Perce. In January 1862, the agent reported that in spite

‘of his warnings against it and request for military aid the town had been

staked out and a dozen wooden houses and 50 others of cloth erected on the
lots. (Pet. Exs. 212, 226).. By June Lewiston reportedly had~a-1200 popue
lation. In harch 1862, the agent reported that the legislature of
Washington Territory had divided the reservation into three counties,
granted charter privileges such as turnpikes and ferries, and had set
into action the political machinery of the counties. Mining towns sprang
up at other locations such as Oro Fine, Pierce City and ?lorence. With
the withdrawal of troops due to the Civil War whites intruded upon the
agricultural and grazing land of the Indians. (Pett‘Ers. 319, 321, 329.
325, 327). By the summer of 1862, there was an estimated white popur
lation of 15,000 in the towns and mining districts. (Pet. Ex. 29?).
10. Even prior to the negotiation and execution of the.Agreement

of.april 10, l86l, the officials of the United States, including the

agent for the Nez Percs, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Oregon

3 575

3 5??

Eerritory and the Acting Governor of Washington Territory, had urged their
superiors in Washington, D. 0., to take immediate steps to obtain a cession
ofpthe gold lands from the NeziPerce, not only to prevent war but to protect the Nez Perce from the_effects of a_gold rush into their territory.
In Febr1:.aJ:'y 1861, a resolution of the United States Senate instructed the
Committee on Indian Affairs to inquire into the expediency of negotiating
for a _cession_ of the_northern portion of the reservation. The Commissioner
of Indian Affairs recomended to this Committee that a treaty be made for
the purchase of said landst It was the summer of 1862, however, before
Congress appropriated money for the purpose of negotiating a treaty with
the tribe.
11. The Commissioners appointed in July 1362 to negotiate with the

Nez Perce did not treat with the Indians in that year._ One of the Commissioners attribnted this delay to several reasons such as not having
received notice of funds being placed to their credit for such a negotiation; to the fact that whites on the reservation were settling on
Indian.grazing and agricultural land which would make it difficult to
negotiate with the tribe; and the need of restoring the confidence of

the Indians in the Government, and -the necessity ofufulfilling prior
treaty obligations before attempting a new treaty.“ On June 9, 1863,
theiNez Perce Tribe entered into a_new treaty with the United States

(11; Stat. 6147, II Kipp. 8943) by winch they ceded all the gold lands to

the Government (Boyce No. hhl, Map of Idaho) retaining a diminished
reserve of some 790,000 acres (Royce E0. 332, Map of Idaho). ,This

treaty was not ratified until April 17, 1867, and was proclaimed on

April 20, 1867.

l2.- The United States (1) in failing to prevent the intrusion of
whites upon the reservation of thesliez Perce established by the treaty of
1855 as required by Article 2 of said treaty, (2);in failing to'prevent
the intrusionof whites upon the lands of the Indians south of the Clearwater_as required by the Agreement of April 10, 1861, (3) in failing to
protect the rights and property of the Nez Perce by securing compensation
for the tribe for the uses made of the reservation by said whites did not
conform with the standard of fair and honorable dealings. The United
States is therefore liable in damages for 1.-iiatever uses of the reservation
by said whites may be proved by said tribe. ;

_l)’. The boundary of the Hez Perce Beservati on established by the

"Treaty of June 11, 1855. was never surveyed. By using the calls of the

treaty, the greater part of the bormdary of the reservation has been .' 

B

placed upon modern maps with no difficulty and is shown identically on
maps offered in evidence by both parties. The north and west boundary
of the reservation are not in dispute and are marked gn“Petitioners‘
Exhibit No. 729 and Defendant's Eahibit A-1. The southern boundary is
found to be the line as drawn on Defendant‘s Exhibit A--l. (Compare with
Surveyor Generalfs Map. Pfet. E2.'No. 695). Theeastern boundary line
which is based upon an impossible call in the 1855 treaty - “by the
spurs of the Bitter Root Mountains” - is more difficult of ascertainment.
However, based upon the evidence and especially the Surveyor C~eneral's
Map, this line is found to be in close proximity to the eastern line
shown on defendant’s Exhibit A-l except for the following adjustment.

- The line sho1L'Ld be moved slightly to the east on the northward part of

¢- .

the line to fall just east of Pierce City and the old location of the
Oro Fino as shown on Petitioners‘ Exhibit 729.: The line will remain as
shown on.A~l with reference to Elk City leaving that city to the east of
the eastern boundary line. r * j

1%. In the era l860-186? gold mined in Idaho was either shipped out
of the Territory through express companies such as the Wells, Fargo
Company or carried out by the miners themselves, and a large amount remained in circulation within the territory. There are no definitive _
production records for either Idaho Territory as asshole or for the mining
claims upon the reservation. Various estimates have been made for both
iareas but they are general in nature and vary tremendously in the amounts
estimated to have been taken out of the territory and districts.

15. During the period 1860-1867, the only anthentic reports of

3 5

gold production‘for the State of Oregon and the Territories of Washington I

and Idaho which was deposited in the United States Mint, its San Francisco

branch and the New York Assay Office are contained in the_Director of the

t: Mint reports for those years. These reports show the gold received by

the Mint and its branches for each fiscal year and the accumulations for
the preceding years, but they do not'show the output of mines in the Nez
Perce reservation. Such reports are not in evidence but the documents

in which they appear are shown in subsequent findings and the essential

t* or parts thereof are set forth in such findings.

16. The Director of the hint made reports for each of the fiscal
.years 1863 through 1867, in which he reported_deposits in the Mint, its
iSan Francisco branch and its New York.Assay Office of domestic gold

received from western states and terr tories, as follows:

for the preceding three years set forth next ahove, the source, that~is,
the Vstate or country from shence it is derived, if it can.be ascertained"
(required by_General Instructions, Def. Exs. 2M, 25 and 26) is not shown.
18. The evidence shows that large amounts of gold were produced in ‘
the He: Perce reservation within the boundaries determined by Finding 13.
It is not shown, however, that any'part of it was acquired by respondent
through the hint or any'of its branches. If, however, by further evidence

it can be shown that part of the gold.produced in Idaho territory and

8 acquired by the mint originated in the Hes Perce reservation, we find the

respondent liable for the value thereof.
