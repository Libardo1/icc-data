FINDINGS OF FACT ON GEEERAL ISSUES.

euggjg-$n 

The Commission makes the following findings of fact on general
issues;

1. Dockets lS~J and 7leA were consolidated for trial herein.

The Prairie Band of the Pot natomi Tribe of Indians, petitioner
in Docket No. lS»J, hereinafter referred to as the Prairie Band, and
the Citizen Band of Potawatomi Indians of Oklahoma, petitioner in
Docket No. 7l=A, hereinafter referred to as the Citizen Band, are both
organized bands of.American Indians residing within the territorial
limits of the United States and have capacity to bring suit under the
Indian Claims Commission Act.

2. Each of the two bands referred to is suing on its own behalf,
and, through named individual members, on behalf of the Potanatomi
Nation which entered into a treaty with the United States (9 Stat. 853)
on June 5 and 17, l8h6 for the cession of the two tracts of land which
are the subject of the consolidated proceedings. Following a subsequent
treaty entered into Rovember 15, l86l (l2 State ll9l) the Potawatomi
Nation was divided into the Prairie Band and the Citizen Bando ‘A census
made pursuant to the l86l treaty showed that at that time the Potawatomi
Nation had 2,180 members, of when 780 fo med the Prairie Band and l,hOO
formed the Citizen Bando Thereafter the defendant recognized the Prairie

None of the foregoing is in dispute, and all these facts
have been expressly conceded by the defendant in Docket N050
lS~B and 111, in which proceedings see petitioners‘ Proposed
Findings 1-23 conceded by defendant, and defendant‘s Proposed

3. Before the proofs were closed, on the motion of the defendant,
Dockets l3=J and toes were also consolidated for trial with Dockets
lSwJ and ?1eA. In Dockets l3wJ and hO+H, individuals claiming to
represent the Chippewa and Ottawa tribes respectively, allege that the
said tribes had an interest in the tract located in Iowa ceded by the

Potawatomi Nation to the United States under the l8ho treaty.

The United Nation occupied the Iowa tract, which had been granted
to it by the Treaty of September 26, 1833 (7 Stat. h3l). The St. Joseph
band and the Babaeh band occupied the49eagetRiver-tract,“nhich had been
granted to them by the Treaty of February ll, l837 (7 Stat. 532). The
membership of the Kankakee band was divided, part being on the Iowa tract
and part on the Osage River tract.

EVIDENCE

Both the preamble to the 18h6 treaty (9 Stat. 853) and

the journal of the negotiations in l8hS (Cl. (71-A) Ex. 33)

identify the four bands.

5. The United Nation was a band made up predominantly of Potawatomi Indians, with which individuals or small groups of Ottawa and
Chippewa ancestry were affiliated or federated. The United States
dealt with the United Nation as a political entity in the treaties of
August 2h, 1816 (7 Stat. lhé); August 19, 1825 (7 Stat. 272); August 25,
1828 (7 Stat. 315); July 29, 1829 (7 Stat. 320); and September 26, 1533
(7 Stat. h3l). All of these treaties related to lands west of Lake
Michigan, in northern Illinois and sonthern'Wisconsin. The lands ceded

to the United States by the 1833 treaty were referred to by United

States officials as Potawatomi lands, and the treaty was referred to by

h bl;

a Government official as the ”Pottawatomie treaty." Various descriptions
of the United Nation in its treaties recognized it as a grouping of
lndians residing west of Lake Michigan on lands watered by the Illinoiss
Milwaukee and.Manitoouck Riverss
The Chippewa and Ottawa Indians who residedg at the time of the
United Nation treaties between 1816 and 18333 in northern.Michigan9 were
not part of the United Nation.
EVIDENCE
The organization of Potawatomi, Ottawa and Chippewa Indians
in a unified tribe or hand followed the tradition of the three

as "the confederated Tribes of Ottawasg Chippewas & Pottonotomies

dssoribed by various Government officials, as "the land of these

"Eottawatomies" (Clo (7luA) Ex. ll). The five treaties concluded between the United States and the United Nation described
the latter variously as: "the united tribes of Ottawas, Chipawas,
and Pottowotomees, residing on the Illinois and.Melwakee rivers,
and their waters, and on the southwestern parts of Lake
Michigan" (l8l6, 7 Statalh6); “the ttawa, Chippewa, and Potawatomie tribes of the Illinois" and the "Illinois Indians"
(1825, 7 Stat. 272, Arte 9); "the United Tribes of Potawatomie,
Chippewa and Ottawa Indians" (l828, 7 Stat. 315); “the United
Nations of Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawaaomie Indians, of the
waters of the Illinois, Milwaukee, and.Eanitoouck Rivers"
(1829, 7 stat. 320); "the United Nation of Chippewa, Ottowa
and Potawatamie Indians" (1833, 7 Stata h3l)a
'With reference to the l8l6 treaty, sometimes referred to
as the Edwardsville treaty, it was observed by*a Government
official in l822 that “the Indians are in fact almost all Potawatamies" (Def. Ex. 78). J. F. Schernerhorn, a United States
representative at the 1833 treaty, referred to it in a letter
‘written in January l83h as "the late Pottaaatinie treaty"
(Cl. (7l~A) Ex. l8). A census of the Indians under the Chicago

agency in l833 showed h,h89 Potawatomi, 35$ Cttawa and hS3

6. In.Ancust 1825, the U-ited States assembled at Prairie dn Chien

a number of Indian tribes residing between lake hi-higan and the Missouri

River. A treaty was concluded.August 19, 1825 in which the boundaries
dividing the lands of neighboring tribes were described, including
those of the United Nation in northeastern Illinois and southeastern
hhsconsin bordering on the west side of Lake Michigan, as well as to
adjoining lands further west in northern Illinois and southwestern
Wisconsin. These lands are shown on Royce's maps Illinois 2 and'Wis«
oonsin 1 as tract Nos. lh7. 1&8 and 187.

EVIDENCE

 

Article 9 of the Prairie du Chien treaty (Aug. 19, 18253
? Stat. 272'), which deals with the boundaries of the lands of
the United Nation, refers back to the treaty of.Aug. 2h, 1816
(7 Stat. lhé) which had settled a disputed land claim between
the United States and the United Nation (See preamble to 1816
treaty). The 1816 and 1825 treaties establish the United Nation
as an entity in the area shown on Royce's maps, Illinois 2 and

'Wisconsin 1, as Nos. 1M7, 1&8 and 187.

7. A group of Chippewa Indians, independent of the United Nationg
was also party to the 1825 treaty of Prairie dn Chien. For this group
the boundaries of "Chippewa country" were fixed in northern'Wisconsin3
north of the lands of the Menominee and Winnebago lndians3'which were
between the “Chippewa country” so bounded and the lands of the United
Nation. The boundaries dividing the lands of the Chippewa, Menominee
and Winnebago lndians were subsequently more precisely detined and cone

mng;rmed.by'the Treaty of August 113 1827, 7 St t. 303.

EUIDENCE

See.Articles S, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of the 1825 treaty.

That the l82S treaty was dealing with the boundaries of
politically organized groups rather than with ethnic "tribes"
is clear from the fact that the Chipgewa "tribe", and the United
Nation which included Chippewa Indians, were different and
distinct parties to the treaty, and that the boundaries of the
Chippewa "tribe" and of the United Nation-were distinct and
separated by the lands of other Indian groups (See.Articles S,
6, 7, 8, and 9). Note that the United nation was also referred
to on occasions as "the Illinois Indians" (See.Art. 9 of

Prairie du Chien treaty, Aug. 19, 1825 (7 Stat. 272), and Def.
Ex. 78).

8. In 1829, the United Nation ceded to the United States Royce
Areas lb? and lh8, referred to above in Finding 6. In 1833, the United
Nation still held its interest in Royce Area 187, also referred to in
Finding 6. Royce Area 187, bordering on Lake Michigan, in northeastern
Illinois and southeastern.Wisconsin, was estimated by United States
officials to comprise five million acres. 8

adjourned, the Commissioners stated that they had been instructed by
the President not to have any talks with non-Indian representatives of
the lndians, but to deal only with the chiefs themselves through their

$850,000 for the Potawatomi tract, out of which were to be deducted the

subsistence for the Indians for one year on such lands, as well as the

The United States agree to pay said nation of Indians, at
the first annuity patment after the ratification of this treaty,
and after an appropriation shall have been made by Congress, the
sum of fifty thousand dollars, out of the aggregate sum granted
in the third article of this treaty, to enable said Indians to
arrange their affairs, and pay their just debts, before leaving
their present homes; to pay for their improvements; to purchase
wagons, horses, and other means of transportation, and pay individuals for the loss of property necessarily sacrificed in
moving to their new homes; said sum to be paid, in open council,
by the proper agents of the United States, and in such just

proportions to each band as the President of the United States
may direct.

VI

The said tribes of Indians agree to remove to their new
homes, on the Kansas River, within two years from the ratification of this treaty; and further agree to set apart the sum
of twenty thousand dollars to the upper bands, (being ten
dollars per head,) and ten thousand dollars to the lower bands,
(being five dollars per head,) to pay the actual expenses of
removing; and the sum of forty thousand dollars for all the
bands, as subsistence money, for the first twelve months after
their arrival at their new homes; to be paid to them so soon
as their arrival at their new homes is made known to the government, and convenient arrangements can be made to pay the same

36. That pursuant to the articles of the l8h6 treaty set forth
in Finding 35, the defendant disbursed for the Potawatomi Nation
$50,000 under Article 5, and $70,000 as required by Article 6, and
charged said Nation with $87,000 for the 576,000 acres of land in
Kansas, ceded said Nation by Article h, and set up a trust fund in the
amount of $6h3,000 in accordance with Article 7 of the treaty. The
Kansas tract is shown in Royce, Kansas 2, tracts h33 and h3h.

In the case of Kaw Tribe et al. V. United States, 1 Ind. Cls.
Com. 608, 613, the Commission awarded the Kaw Tribe the sum of 50 cents

included the same 576,000 acres (Tracts E33 and hjh) granted said Nation
in June, l8h6.

‘We, accordingly, find that the consideration for the l8h6 cession
was $1,051,000, being the sum of $850,000 provided for in Article 3
of the l8h6 treaty, plus the value of the 576,000 acres of Kansas land
ceded by Article h of that treaty, $288,000, less $87,000 deducted
therefor from the cash consideration.

said tract is the south five million acres of Area 265 as shown on
Hoyce's map, Iowa 2, and that the north boundary thereof is approximately the h2nd parallel of latitude. Its south boundary is the south
border of the state, and its west boundary'for“the most part is the
Missouri River, which is the west state line. t embraces the present
southwest Iowa counties of Shelby, Pottasattamie, Cass, Mills, Montgomery, Adams, Fremont, Page and Taylor, and parts of Monona, Crawford,

Carroll, Harrison, Audubon, Adair, Union and Ringgold.

38.

Iowa was established as a Territory on June 12, 1838, by division

of the Wisconsin Territory (5 Stat. 235), and became a State on December 28,

181:6 (9 Stat. 117), at which time it had a population of 81,920.

39.

The Iowa tract was largely prairie land with rich, black soil.
It is highly productive and above the average in the state. Figures
12, 13, 1h, and IS in defendant's Exhibit 63 give the principal soil

associations. Average annual precipitation varies from 28 to 3h inches,

the majority of which comes in the growing season of from ISO to 170

days ( Figures 8, 9, 10 and ll). The land is well drained by numerods

"1
watercourses.8 Along the Missouri River which forms the west boundary of
the tract, there is a strip of bottomland and then a belt of hills,

commonly'known as the Missouri bluffs (Figure 16).

U0. In 18b6, timber was confined to patches and groves mainly

forest cover is depicted on the
map, Figure I7, in defendant’s Exhibit 63. It included oak, cottonwood,

black walnut, hickorg, elm and linden.

h h36

None of the Iowa tract was classified as "mineral lands” either in

the l8S2 final report of Owen‘s Geological Survey of Wisconsin, Iona,
and.Minnesota, or in any of the proclamations of land sale. There is
evidence in the record that stone, sand and gravel have subsequently
been taken from parts of the area, but as of 18b6, outcrcppings and
easily available supplies were not abundant. The Indian sub-agent at
Conncil Bluffs, in an l83? report, notes that "the only rock hitherto
observed is a horizontal limestone, which appeared under a very super
stratum of soil at several points in the Missouri bluffs, also at the
falls of Buchanan's fork, and in the beds of some of the more considerable streams," that "clay suited to the manufacture of brick, pottery,
and the like, is somewhat common, but sand for similar purposes is by no
means abundant," and that he has “as yet seen none that would answer a
good purposes“

The same report states that “indications of coal exist in several
placeso" sen’s l8Sl Geological Map (15-J Exhibit 3) shows the west
edge of the Coal Field of Iowa as extending over most of the Iowa tracts
His report describes the coal of Iowa as shallow, thehthickest vein not
exceeding four to five feet and being on the whole, inferior in quality

and that elsewhere in Iowa hOO tons of coal were produced in l8bO and
6,500 tons in l8h6. The presence of coal on the Iowa tract for future
commercial mining had li tle effect upon the value of the land in l8h6

and its use for fuel by occupants was also a minor consideration.

bl. while the Iowa tract was in an undeveloped state in 18b6,
then and immediately thereafter its best potential use was for farming,

the growing of crops such as wheat, corn and oats and the production

of livestock. Most of the land was well adapted to being broke and

cultivated, It was free from obstructions such as trees, stumps, roots
and stone. .Around l8h6 improved farm machinery was becoming available,
some of which is pictured in the.Appendix of 15-J Exhibit 28. Flows,
seeders, harrows, reapers and threshers, many as yet in a crude state,

were operated with horses or oxen.

H2. The terrain of the Iowa tract was conducive to the building of
access roads. There were few roads in l8h6, but by 1850 a young man
travelinc across the Iowa cession on a trip from southeast Iowa to
California described some of the road as "very good." He also confirms
the use of the Council Bluffs area by the Mormons as a way station on
their trek westward, the first of whom were reported to have come there
late in l8h5.

In this period, in order to more products to major markets and to

obtain distant lumber and supplies, it was necessarv to use waterttransCd

The average price of wheat on the l8h5 Cincinnati market was 60.5

prices: winter wheat hO cents per bushel, spring wheat 30 cents, oats

World markets and United States exports were generally expanding in

was less in 1850 than in 1850 and little more than in l830.

The lands acquired under the 18h6 treaty became part of the
public domain and were thereafter handled in accordance with United States
land policy and statutes.

The.Act of.April 2h, 1820 (3 Stat. 566) provided for public sales in
half-quarter sections (80 acres) to the highest bidder at not less than
_$le25 per acreo .After the close of public sales, lands were subject to

the minimum price of $1.25 per acre.

h hhl

The.Act of'March 3, l8hS (S Stat. 789), pursuant to which Iona was
later admitted to the Union, granted to the state one section in each
township in aid of public schools.

In l8Sh, there was enacted a law (10 Stat, 57h) which reduced the
minimum price of unsold land which had been on the market for ten years
to $loOO an acre, for fifteen years to 75 cents an acre, for twenty years
to 50 cents an acre, for twentywfive years to 25 cents an acre and for
thirty years to 12% cents an acreo A policy of graduation was proposed
and discussed for a number of years prior to this enactment. Mr. James
Shields, Commissioner of the General Land Office, in his Annual Report
for l8h5, dated November 29, l8hS, labeled the practice "absurd" and
"unjust" in which "the average maximum price of the best quality of
public lands had been found by experience to be only $1027 per acre,
while the mininim price of the worst quality is $l¢2S per acre," and
proposed a graduation in five classes from $1.25 to 25 cents per acre.
President James K. Polk, in his annual message to Congress on December 2,
18b5, recommended a policy of graduation and reduction of price on
inferior public lands.

Numerous acts of Congress dealt with the issuance of military
warrants and scrip to certain classes of persons, which could be used
in obtaining public lands. “warrants in cennection with the Revolutionary‘
‘war and the war of 1812 were not transferable, Corgress made a number

of these warrants,

to raise an army for the Mexican'War, offered warrants or assignable scrip
of less value. A series of acts, beginning with 1850 (9 Stat. 520)

liberalized the whole bounty policy and enlarged its coverage. By.Act of
March 22, 1852 (10 Stat. 3) all warrants were made assignable, among other
benefits. ‘When.warrants were used on selected land, they were to be

honored at $1.25 per acre. The.Act of March 3, 1855 (lO*Stat. 701)
granted to all officers and soldiers who had served in any war in'nhioh
our country had been engaged, from the Revo1ution.to March 3, 1855,

160 acres each or so much, with what had been previously allowed, as
would make up that quantity. 8. H. Hibbard, in.A History of the Public

Land Policies, explains:

 

in the early years of land bonnties they were given as an in»
dnoenent to men to enlist. During the fifties they were granted
as a reward for services long past and evidently in a spirit of
generosity as additional pay.

The.Act of'May 15, 1856, which made railroad grants to the State of
Iowa, provided that alternate sections retained by the United States

should not be sold for less than $2.50 per acre.

two million acres a year sold, a gross increase on the market of
eight million acres a year and a net increase of six million acres
annually. In 18b6, 2,168,000 acres were sold and l79,2hS,000 acres
were on the market. In Table l of the same exhibit, after l8h9 sales
remained below two million acres annually until they reached about
7 million acres in l8Sh, rose to a peak of almost 16 million acres in
1855, dropped to 9 million acres in 1856 and then leveled off to from
3 to h million acres through 1860.

The l8hS message of President Polk, referred to in Finding ll,

stated:

From the records of the General Land Office it appears that
of the public lands remaining unsold in the several States
and Territories in which they are situated, 39,105,577
acres have been in the market subject to entry more than
twenty years, h9,638,6hh acres for n re than fifteen years,
73,07h,600 acres for more than ten years, and l06,l76,96l
acres for more than fire yearso

In the neighboring states of Illinois and Missouri, in approximate

.5‘

figures, Illinois wita a total state area of 3§§ million acres had

16 million acres of offered and unoffered land remaining unsold in l8h6,

.and.Missouri with a state area of h} million acres had 30 million acres,

h hhl

b8. The State of Iowa had an area of 32,§8h,960 acres. Survey
and sale of public land began in the southeastern part of the state.
Figure 23 in defendant's Exhibit 63 is a.map from the l8h8 General
Land Office Report showing the progress of the land survey in Iowa.

ts first public land went on sale in 1838. From that date until

January l, 18b6, 6,700,000 acres had been offered for sale and
1,700,000 acres (about 25%) had been sold. In nine southeast Iowa
counties, according to Table 3 of defendant‘s.Exhibit 63, 2,h§9,000
acres were put on sale during the same period (most of it from 1838

to l8h0) and 1,215,000 acres (about 50%) were sold.

b9. Surveys within the Iowa tract began in l8h8. They were made
in the order which, in the opinion of the Surveyor General, would
command the most ready sale. Generally speaking, the surveys began
at the Missouri State line and moved northward. Surveys for most of
the tract were completed by the end of l8Sh. Each surveyor was re»
quired to make notes on the land he surveyed. A number of these notes
are in evidence.

The first land.within the tract offered for sale was through the
Fairfield Land Office in 1850. Fifteen.townships in Adams and.Taylor
counties consisting of 328,275 acres went on the market, but no sales
‘were made that year or until l8S3.' Most of the Iowa tract was sold
through the Chariton Land Office (open from October, l8§2 to June, i859},
and the Kanesville Office, later called Council Bluffs Conan from March,
l8§3 to May, l8?3). The Fairfield Office was closed in Joremter 18??

and jurisdiction of its remaining unsold lands transferred to the

h hh5

By 1853, land was being put on the market at a greatly increased
rate but sales were slow. A summary of ten counties within.the tract
through 1853 shows 2,9S2,3h8 acres offered for sale and l69,h53 acres
(S.7h%) sold. Roscoe L. Lokken in his book, "Iowa Land Disposal" writes:

The first public auction at Kanesville came on June 6,

1853, but only a little over a thousand acres was sold.

The speculators in public lands had not yet turned their

eyes so far westward, and consequently, the rich and fertile

prairies of western Iowa remained without buyers. The

Presidential Proclamation, set June 10 and July 11, for

additional land sales, and the General Land Office Report

for 1853 indicates that over 33,000 acres had been disposed

of before the latter date.

By the end of 185k, a total of hhl,767 acres within the tract
in eleven counties had been sold.

In the first selection of lands as they were settled and put on
the market, settlers showed a distinct preference for land near the
‘watercourses and near some timber. This same preference for prairie
land with water and timber near was common throuehout this eriod

D
and the surrounding area. A number of the Surveyor's Notes on the
tract commented on the absence of timber.

In the year 1855 and up until May 31, l8S6, when all Iowa lands
were withdrawn from sale so that the State of Iowa could.make its
selection of lands for railroad purposes under the Act of May 15, 1856
(11 Stat. 9), sales within the tract were made at such a rapid rate
that it could be properly called a land been. J. W. Denisen, a purchaser for an eastern cennanv buvin: lands for speculation reported

Council Bluffs Land Office from 1861 to 1873, wrote concerning that
office that in some instances the number of'entries was limited by the
register of the land office, and that “especially during the early part

of 1856 the rush and pressure to enter land was unprecedented.” He says

.3‘U

I

.at early in May 1856, after passage of the law making large donations
of public lands in aid of four proposed railroads and the rumor that
all land offices in the state would be closed, “the pressure at the
register's office became fiercer than ever, and the clerks were worked
day and night to meet the demand for land." During the month of Maya
the total entries at the office reached over 200,000 acrese

A further summary of the figures from the eleven counties previously
referred to is as follows:

The unsold lands in the Iowa tract were restered to the market in
February, 1858a ‘When the homestead act was passed in May l862, practim

cally all of the lands in the tract had been sold by the Governments

h ht?

50. iost of the sales of land in the Iowa tract by the Government
were made at the $1.25 per acre statutory minimum price. After 1855,
some prices ranged as high as $h.00 per acre. As to the percentage paid
for in.cash, some tabulations in evidence are not broken down into cash,
scrip and warrants, but there is enough to give the general picture.
Sales at the Kanesville Land Office from its opening in March, 1853
through the year 1856, show 816,312 acres paid for in cash and 1,086,981
acres paid for in military warrants.

The great impetus to sales caused

by the liberal warrant act of 1855, which had released a flood.of new
warrants, is evident in the report of sales in Council Bluffs between
February, 1858 and August lh, 1858 from 1,313,280 acres restored to
private sale, of 709,859 acres located eith warrants and 20,000 acres
for cash. For the State of Iona as a whole, down to June 30, 1867, of
25% millions acres sold for both cash and warrants, h5% were sold for
cash and 55% for warrants.
From the time of the first sales in the Iowa tract, military

warrants were assignable and they could.be purchased at less than $1.25

per acre. It is not possible to determine with accuracy the number of

sales at a depreciated price and what these prices were, but warrants

«.0

‘were reported in Iowa as selling in 1:50 at 8h cents to $1.00 per acre,

in 1855 and 1856 at $1.00 per acre, and in 185? at 60 to 85 cents per acre.

J.

Some otl€TS in Iowa formed what have been called "claims associU}
{D

ations” for the purpose of aiding the.se1ves in getting the land upon

! C

which they were squatters at the 81.25 niairra. These were principally

hhl;

persons who could not fulfill all of the conditions of the pre-emption

law. By 1856, land speculators were active in western Iowa and there
were some instances of compromises with other potential bidders to keep
the pr ic e dorm .

51. The cost to the government of the surveys and disposition of
the public lands from the beginning to 1880, was an average of 6.2 cents
per acre, according to the official study of the history of the public

domain made for Congress by Thomas Donaldson.

§

52. Evidence in the record of resale of lands in the Iowa tract

includes a summary abstract of SO conveyances in Fremont County in l85h.
These were small select tracts in the very southeast corner of the
cession. 3,975 acres were sold averaging 79.5 acres per sale, at an
average price of $h.SS per acre. An abstract of SO conveyances the same
year in Mills County, just north of Fremont, aggregated h,7OS acres,
averaging 9h acres in size at an.average price of $3.61 per acre. A
memorandum of 581 land resales in Adams, C8583 Ringold, Crawford; Shelby
and Page counties in the years l8S2 to 1866 discloses the sale of
10?.398 acres averaging 190 acres in size at an average price of $2.75

OS AGE TRAC T

5h. The Osage River tract, hereafter called the Osage tract,
contained 909,565.62 acres in the present State of Kansas. All parties
hereto agree as to the acreage and its location, as surveyed and platted
by J. C. McCoy in 1838 (7l~A Exhibit A-3 and A-3a) and as shown by
Royce designated Area 266, Kansas 2. Its east boundary was about 16
miles from the present east border of the State of Kansas and its north
boundary was very near the center of the state from north to south.
It encompassed all of the present county of Anderson and portions of

Coffey, Osage, Franklin, Miami and Linn.

55. The Territory of Kansas was created by Act of May 30, 185k
(10 Stat. 277). Kansas was admitted as a state on January 29, 1861

(12 Stat. 126), at which time it had a population of 107,206.

56. In l8h6, and thereafter, the best potential use of the

Osage tract was for general farming, the growing of small grains and
hay, and the production of livestock. Host of the soil was good and
adapted to eultivaeign, Figure L2 of defendant’s Exhibit 63 is a
generalized soil association map of the area. Some soils were thin
and were not classed as iirst grade. It is estimated that about hO
per cent of the tract is more suitable for pasture than crops. "Yields
are about average for the State of Kbnsas. The elevation of the tract

is about l lOO feet. The topography is for the most part gentl; sloping.

J

Temperatures are favorable to general crop farming and the average
8 growing season is between 180 and 190 days (Figures 38 and 39)o ihe
average annual precipitation is 37 inches, two-thirds of which is usually
received during the growing season from April 1 to September 30 (Figures
b0 and kl). Drainage was a problem only in wet years on some of the
lheavier bottomlands. Some dry years have been experiencedo Except for
the southwest draining into the Neosho River and the southeast into
the Little Osage River, most of the tract is drained by tributaries of
the Osage River in a northeast direction. The Osage River itself

crossed the very northeast tip of the tract.

5?. In 18b6, roughly 7 per cent of the Osage tract was timbered
land, found chiefly along the streams. The native vegetation on more
than 90 per cent of the tract was tall prairie grass.

None of the tract was classified and sold as "mineral land."
Surveyors in 1856, mentioned in their field notes an abundance of good
rock for building, fencing and other purposes, and made occasional
references to coal, petroleum, iron and lead ores, and salt. In 1828,
Isaac McCoy had reported seeing coal on Neosho at the Osage Agency and
further south. In 1837, the Sub-agent on the Osage River reported an
abundance of linestone and sandstone, the presence of stone, coal, and

indications of lead ore. Both coal and oil have been produced in or

the cession had little or no economic significanceo The state geologist

for Kansas commented in 1886 on the "tar springs” as follows:

I...)

M h5l

The existence of "tar springs" in Missouri and Kansas, has
long been known to the settlers and hunters of those regions,
but they attracted no particular attention, as the "rock tar"
had been applied to no useful purposes, except as a lubricator
of the freighter‘s wagon, and a limited application as a domestic medical remedy.

58. Roads and water transportation in the Osage tract were undeveloped in l8h6. A wagon road from Arkansas, which crossed the

tract and Potawatomie Creek and to the northwest intersected the

Santa Fe trail, was reported to have been in use by California-bound

travelers before Kansas was opened to settlenent. A road from'Westport

(now Kansas City) to the Potawatomie Crossing during the Indian period
later became an important highway connecting Kestport with the country
to the southwest used by white settlers. Beginning with an Act of
August 3, l8Sh (10 Stat. 3h?) large sums of money were provided for
laying out and constructing post roads in Kansas.

Streams on the tract were for the most part not navigable. ‘Westport was the nearest settlement on the Eisscuri River, about 50 miles

from the northeast corner of the tract.

59. In l8h6, there was no immediate or near prospect of railroad
transportation in or close to the Osage tract. wlt was not until 1862
that substantial land grants were made in the State of Kansas for railroad construction. From 1862 to ldoh grants of over 16 million acres

were made. The Act of Earch 3, 1863 (12 Stat. ??2) granted the state

1; L152

Galveston Railroad route, which was to run through the tract and which

was later laid out through its center, as shown by the survey map of
November 15, 1866 (71—A Exhibit A—lO)., If any of these sections had been
sold or attached under the preuemption or homestead law, other lands were
given within 20 miles of each side. The tract was within this 20-mile
limit of two other roads to be constructed outside the tract -— the
Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad Co. (Act of March 3, 1863, 12 Stat,
772) and.the Missouri River, Fort Scott & Gulf Railroad Co. (Act of
July 25, 1866, lh Stat. 236).

Actual construction of the Leavenworth, Lawrence and Galveston
Railroad began at Lawrence, Kansas, in 1866 and proceeded south, reach»
ing the town of Ottawa, just north of the Osage tract, late in 1867.

Construction continued in a southerly direction until the entire tract

was traversed by 1870.8

60. In 18b6, settlement was moving sl wly toward the Osage tract,
A sampling of eight townships in.western Missouri across the state line
east of the tract shows that in the year l8h6 only 319 acres were sold
in all eight townships (Figure 8, defendant‘s Exhibit 63), although

there were over 137,000 acres available for sale. From then until 1852,

less than two thousand acres were sold in any one year, For the State

of Missouri as a.who1e (admi ted to the Union in 1821), roughly onen

t h53

500,000 acres every year from l8hl to l8h7. In 18b6, approximately 27

million acres were on the market with 3 million to be added between

18h6 and l8h9.

61. An Act of July 22, 18Sh (10 Stat. 308) provided for the surVey and sale of Kansas lands to which Indian title had been extinguished
and made such lands subject to pre—emption.

Most of the Osage tract was surveyed in l8§6. Its first public
sales were held in 1859 under Presidential Proclamation No. 636 dated
March 22,;l8S9. All sales under this proclamation were made at the
Lecompton Land Office until transferred to Topeka by Executive Order
of July en, 1861.

A grant to the Sac and Fox under treaty of October ll, l8h2 (7 Stat.
595) overlapped approximately 90,000 acres in the northwest portion of
the tract. ‘With certain exclusions including this overlap, a study was
made of the disposition of 733,62l.bO acres under Proclamation No. 636,
of which all but about 20,000 acres were within the tract (Table A, 71-3
Exhibit A-30). Before public sales opened on July l8 and.August 22,
1859, 389,373.57 acres, or Sh%, had been pre-empted. Frou1the public
sale dates through 1860, an additional 168,291.95 acres, or 22%, were
soldo Sales from 1851 (2l,7lh,69 acres), hcmesteads after*lB62 (25,181-50

under the Agricultural and Mechanical College Act of July 2, l862 (12 Stat.

553). Practically all cash sales were at the $1.25 minimum.

62. Lands of the Sac and Fox adjoining and overlapping the Osage
tract on the north and west (Royce areas hl9 and h9h, Kansas 2) were
appraised in 1861 by three appraisers appointed by the Secretary of
Interior at a weighted average of $1.25 per acre. There were three
classifications of land totaling 278,332.60 acres. An l86h re—appraisal
increased the weighted average to about $1.29. Under terms of the
treaty of October 1, 1859 (15 Stat. h67), most of this land was sold by
means of sealed bids in 1865 and l866 for an average of $1.05 an acre.
The treaty of February l8, l867 (15 Stat. L95) provided for the sale
of the remaining Sac and Fox lands to the government at $1.00 an acre
and their resale by the government at $1.50 an acre.

68,292.29 acres of Sac and Fox lands in.townships enolly or partially
Wiohin.the Osage tract were sold under the 1859 treaty at an average
Prlce of 85 cents an acre (Table C, ?l~A Exhibit A~30}. In the same

Cauegory of townships, 85,598.89 acres were sold under the l86? treaty

far $1.50 an acre.

63. Birectly north of and contiguous to the Osage tract, and
east;cd‘the Sac and Fox lands, Chippewa-Eunsee trust land (Royce area
AQI3, Kansas 2} of less than h,OOO acres were to be sold at not less
‘31ar:their appraised value to the highest bidder for cash under the

provisions of the treaty of .1113; 16, 1859 (12 Stat. 1105}. In 3865,

h LS6

they were appraised at values ranging from $1.25 per acre for third
grade land to $2.00 per acre for first grade land. 1,113.3? acres
were sold in 1866 at an average price of $2.01 per acre, and 2,687.9h
acres in 1871 at an average price of $h.hh. All of these lands were
within.the ten—mile limit of the Leavenworth, Lawrence & Galveston

Railroad.

6h. North of and contiguous to the Csage tract, and directly
east of the Chippewa—Munsee, were the lands of the Ottawa tribe
(Royce area h35, Kansas 2). The treaty of June 2h, 1862 (12 Stat.

1237) provided for the allotment of lands in severalty among the

acres for the erection and endowment of a school, and the appraisal

and sale of the remaining trust lands.

Of the school lands, 5,000 acres were sold in 1862 for $1.25 an
acre. Of the remaining unimproved lands, 3,032.2h acres were sold
between l86h and 1872 for an average of $7.h8 per acre and ll,982.S2
acres were appraised in 1872 at an average of $h.S0 an acre.

‘The trust lands comprising 30,137.56 acres were appraised in l86h
at from $1.25 to $5.00 an acre, averaging $2.00 an acre. BetweenIMav
l86h and May 1866, 22,377 acres were sold at an average of $2.50 per
acre. The Leavenworth, Lawrence & Galveston Railroad ran directly

throuch the town of Ottawa and the whole Cttawa reserve was within its
5

ten-mile limit.

65.

North of and contiguous to the Osage tract, and east of the
tawasg were the lands of the confederated tribes of Peorias, KaskaskiaS9

'Weas and Piankashans. The treaty of May 30, l8Sh (10 Stat. 1082) pro»

vided for the sale at auction of part of these lands (Royce area 326,

Kansas 2) for the benefit of the Indians. Sales began in June, 185?,

and the 1860 Annual Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs reported

that 20737S8.8S acres had been sold for an average of $1.67 an acre.
Lands to the east (Royce area 326, Kansas 2) comprising 5,680 acres
were reserved under the l8Sh treaty, and sales to settlers negotiated
by the Indians in 1866 were ayproved by the treaty of February 23, 1867
(15 Stat. 518).

These sales ranged from $3.00 to $5.25 an acre, averaging $h.00 an acre.

66.

East of and contiguous to the Osage tract were the lands of the

Miami tribe (Royce areas 329 and 330, Kansas 2). The greater part of

in

4" .

these lands was ceded to the United States by the treaty of June 5, 18
(10 Stat. 1093). 10,608.13 acres of unallotted land.were appraised in
18?3 at an average of $h.76 per acre, excl sive of improvements made
thereon by settlers. Most of these lands were already settled and
improved and the Act of March 3, 1873 (17 Stat. 631) provided that the

lands were to be sold at their appraised values to the settlers airea V

the Kansas reserve. Except for a small number of allotments, the reserve

was proclaimed a part of the public domain in December, l860, and thereafter sold under the public land laws at the statutory minimum.

68. Br Article 1 of the treat: of Jannarv lL, 15b6, the United

States purchased from the Kansas Indians 2,000,000 acres of land, which

are the eastern part of Royce area 26h, Kansas 1. This area lies north

and west of the Osage tract, being about 30 miles therefrom at its
closest point. This acquisition was in compliance with the wishes of
the Potawatomi Indians for a new reservation on both sides of the Kansas
River in that territory, such wish having been expressed in.writing to
Major Thos. H. Harvey at Council Bluffs on June 30, l8hS. The eastern
30 miles of area 26h, consisting of S?6,000 acres, was set aside to

the Totawatomi Indians by Article h of the June 5, 17, l8h6 treaty

(Royce areas L33 and L3h, Kansas 2}, The 2,000,000 acre tract has
