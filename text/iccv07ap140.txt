Pursuant to the provisions of the Indian Claims Commission Act

filed a petition setting forth some seventeen separate claims against

the Cnited States. Defendant in due course answered the complaint,

lengthy motion for summary iudcment, asking this Commission to find

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 1&0 lhl

that there exists no genuine issue of fact between the parties and
that all the claims asserted by the petitioner should be resolved

in defendant's favor as a matter of law. Petitioner has responded

to defendant's motion by filing its "Statement of pposing Points

and Authorities To The Kocion Of The Defendant For Summary Judgment.”
In opposition to the defendant's motion the petitioner demanded oral
argument on the motion and for the most part insisted that only a
trial on the merits could settle the.issues as raised in the pleadings.

The motion for summary judgment is intended to raise all matters in the pleadings as well as any matters outside the record
properly presented by affidavit or otherwise. At this state of the
proceedings the entire record consists of the cozplaint and answer.
and all other matters which this Commission can take judicial notice,
namely, all those prior judicial determinations involving these litigants, as well as pertinent statutes and other applicable law.

Before discussing in detail the individual claims in the petition

' some background material on the petitioner band would seem to be in

order to understand fully the capacity in which the petitioner brings
this action, since the defendant has challenged‘the legal capacity of
the petitioner band both factually and legally in its answer, and
again as a matter of law in its motion for summary judgment.

Early in the nineteenth century the entire Cherohee Kation lived

east of the Eississicoi River, residing hrimarilv in what are now the

states of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Lortn Carolina and South ”~wo”l

There they purportedly possessed and cxned in lndian fashion a vast
territory of approximately lA,CC0,0CO acres. Because of the diversity of social and economic interests between those Cherokee Indians

4.

who occupied what might be terncd the “upper towns” and those of their

bretheren who live in the “lower towns”, a division of their territory

1

was thought to be most desirable. Accordingly, a part of Cherokee
Nation, who felt the need to pursue the forest game and enjoy the agricultural pursuits, sought permission to exchange their present lands

-5

for Kore desirable sites west Oi the Kississippi River. This idea

('1.

became a reality through treaties concluded in l8l7 and lol9 when certain lands were set aside by the Government for the use of the new

Cherokee emigrants who thereafter began to move westward across the

Eississippi. In l828 the United 5tatesty'treaty dealt further but

1 ‘T ‘ ‘

separately with the "Cherokee Nations of -ndians west of the Mississigni“

&

by exchanging the lands already ceded to then under the treaties of l8l7

"l'.;

and l8l9 for other lands west of the n_SSiSSippi situated in what was
described as the Indian Territory. his was the first instance in which
the United States dealt separately with a group of Cherokee Indians as

a single entity apart from the Cherokee Nation. This western group
became more commonly known and referred to as the “Old Settlers” or

"Nestern Cherokees.”

Q

In l835 those Cherokee lndicns remaining east of the Eississippi

-L... '4...‘

purportedly executed a treaty wit: the United 3tates at Eew achota,
Georgia, whereby the Cherokee Nation in consideration of $5,COO,C‘O

-5

ceded all its reaaining lands east o: the Kississippi River with the

7 1nd. Cl. Com. 1&0 lb}

idea that it would in like manner remove in a oody westward across the

river and join up with the "Eastern Cherokees”.

The hew Echota Treaty proved to be a hitter pill to the Cherokee
Nation, as a great many Cherokees rose to challange its validity as
being the unauthorized act of a s:all group of Cherokees who did rnt
in fact represent the Cherokee Kation. Regardless of its validity,
the treaty invoked a great deal of a.inosity, bitter feeling and un~
told hardship among the Cherokees eastiof the Hississippi. Their
stubborn refusal to recognize the treaty or comply with its provisions caused the Governaent to resort to military force in order to
move these Indians across the Eississippi. By 833, the bulk of
these "Eastern Cherokees” had either voluntarily or involuntarily

emigrated westward into the lands of the “Eastern Cherokees”. Of

those Cherokees who refused to emigrate and ul‘i:ately remained be—

('3

hind, the majority were located in North arolina. These Cherokees

in North Carolina numbered about lLOO amditisirem this group th't

a "

the present petitioner, The Eastern Band of Cherokees claim li eal
descent.

This ancestral group of Cherokees never did rejoin the Cherokee

Nation but remained an unorganized collection of individual Cheroktrn

until l€é8 when they did band into a group for certain limited pur~

P0598. They adopted a form of constitution but their members never .

-.3

were organized into any communal land-owning entity, nor did they ii;

no stranger to liti ation, it is possible to gain some idea of how

their status and relationship to the Cherokee mation'was viewed by

the Supreme Court.

reierence to the present law suit, it

more detail the petitioner band’s legal capacity under our lot as governed by the claims it n w asserts herein. For indeed it is the nature of the clai: , whether cornunal or individual, which has a direct

bearing upon the capacity in which the petitio-er.nust choose to litigate.
Parag~aph 3 of the petiticn does afford some insight into the overall position the petitioner will assume in presenting its claixs. The

301lOWing exoerrts are noted.

The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is conoose; of the
direct descendants of those Charo ' '

either voluntarily or 'nv luntarily, emigrate west o: the

a pro-rata basis one -?ifteenth of all amounts which
th Indian Claims Coxmission may find to be justly due

by the United States on account o; the hadxggof the
lands of the Cherokees.

The claim, being one for “the taking of the lands of the Cherokees,”
is by its nature tribal or ccrion claim, since ownership thereof is
comntnal and not individual.

Therefore in its pleafings the petitioner herein wishes to

identify itself with the Cherokee Nation on a cosgenal basis; it

0)

position being that ancestral zembership alone is adeioate to erotect tribal riihts to the propertv and other coznnnal benefits accruing to the Cherokee Hation, and thus in proportion to its members at
Jthe time of its seearation from the Cherokee Eation petitioner desires

a pro rata.share of any recovery due to said nation.

 

Part one of defendant‘s motion attacks those claizs enumerated in

T‘

paragraphs 5 through lo of the petitkxi he basis of each of these

claims is a.treaty of cessiontetween the defendant and the Cherokee

1

Nation irztxhich the Cherokees yielded for a stated consideration cer—
tain lamds to the United States. Petitioner band now contends that the
United Stertes far overreached the Cheroaees, taxing such unfair advantage of time: that the considerationzqhich passed to the Indians for
ands ced“J.was totallv inadequate and unconscionable. ‘Thus, as petitioner states in preliminar' paragraph A, (Petition, o. 3;:

.3, /

-his petitioner respectfully requests that each of the H
treaties her2inafter referred to be revised on saii grounds
of fraud, duress and unccnscicnsole consideration to the
end that t just c mpensaticn be paid to this petitioner for
its proportionate cart of the true value of said lands a

thereon.

Tw defenses are raised in part one of defendant’s motion; (l) in
abandoning the Cherokee Ration in l838, cetitioner‘s ancestors, under
the constitution and laws of the Cherokee dstion, suffered loss of citizenship and forfeiture of all tribal rights to the property of said

Kation, and (2) there was a discharge of all Cherokee claims and de$

mands upon the United States arising fr:m.t_e aforesaid treaties by
virtue of payment pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty of l8a6 (9
Stat. 871), the Qesoluticn of august 7, l3L8 (9 Stat. 339) and the ace
of Congress 2? ii’l (Qotzt. S72}.

looking at the first defense, we find that all the claias spellI

ed out in paragraphs 5 through lo of the eetition are based entirely

upon events which occur ed prior to 1838, the supposed date of departure of petitioner‘s ancestors f on the Cherokee Eation. Thus, during

1

the long period srior to lE38, cetitioner’s ancestors enjoyed full and

In the case of C. U. E Ghee et al. V. The Creea Nation and the

 
  

   

   
   

   

Qgited States, l22 C. Cls. 330, (l952) a group of Cree: Indians,
styled "The 3roek_Nation East of the Eississippi“, tried to intervene
in a suit before the Indian Claire Commission brought by the Creek
Nation against the United States in which said Ration sought recovery
for lands ceded to the United States under an lélh treaty. The Commission denied the petitioner’s motion to intervene and an arpeal was
taken to the Court of Claims.

lnere is a striking similarity in the

status of the intervenin petitioners in the EcGhee case as related

to the Creek nation, and the status of the present petitioner sand in
the instant case as related to the Cherokee Eation.

Q L U

The facts in the EoGhee case show that division in the Creek

the bulk of the Xation which esigrated west. This split was the

lorg departed ancestors were truly n mbers of the Creek Nation regardless of their nithdrawal in 1332, they have a real and legitimate
interest in the outcome of this lawsuit. In reversing the decision
of the Indian Claims Commission and sustaining the motion to intervene the Court of Claims stated:

The maintenance or lack of maintenance of tribal relations and the occurrence or non occurrence of acts of
recognition of tribal organization of the Creek Indians

in Oklahoma or east of the Iississioni, subsequent to lsln,

-4..

would not affect or change what was done to the Creek Nation
of 131-. Any claim for an injury to the Creek Kation of l€ln,
is a claim belonging, if at all, to the descendants of all the
members of that Nation whether they live east or west of the
Mississippi, and whether orranized or not, subsequent to that

date. 122 C. C15. sss)
Having settled the legal basis fundamental to the claim itself subject to proof, the court then went on to settle the basic jurisdictional

question under the Indian Cla.ns Commission tct; that is, whether "The

(1')

Creek Nation East of the Ki sissippi” qualifies as an “identifiable

group". The court settled this issue in the following manner:

To identify is to establish the identity of, and if a
groupgresenting a claim under the Act is capable of 'r
identified as a group of Indians consisting of the d se
ants of members of the tribes or bands which existed at
time the claim arose, the jurisdictional requirements 0
statute, in our opinion, have been net. (122 C, Cls. 3;;

There is no honest reason to distinguish between ULw
and Capacity of the petitioner band in the instant case, and

ted by the United States

with the Cherokee Kation at a tine when petitioner's ancestors were
bona fide members of said Ration. These claims are communal in substance even though the petitioner has filed suit in its own name ard
not in behalf of the Cherokee Eation. But this is a mat
not substance; and the petitiorer band has shown in the pleadinrs

that it seeks only a pro rata share of wh * may be due the Cherokee

Nation.

Defendant's second defense suggests that there has been a discharge and release of all Cherokee claims because of per capita payments to individual Cherokees under the Act of Congress of February 21,
185l. ‘pen receipt of these payments the Cherokees, pursuant to said
statute, were to execute releases showing that said payments were to
"be in full satisfaction and final settlement of all claims and demands

whatsoever of the Cherokee Nation against the United States, under an

treaty heretofore made with the Cherokees“ (Cherokee Nation V. U. S.,

 

#0 C. Cls. 252, 285}
Thus defendant sums up its position as these claims as follows:

,In consideration of the releases executed and delivered
by the Cherokee Eation, the Eastern Cherokees, and the
‘hestern Old Settlers, as above related, coupled with the
full payment and discharge of the two claims made following
the protest of the settlements under Article 9 of the treaty
of 18h6 and the stipulation for an accounting contained in
the ourchase agreeaent of 1903 relating to the Cherokee outlet., 53 is submitted that the Cherokee Nation is estoaoed to
assert an? claizs arrising under the treaties had %;th the
United States and the clains set forth in the petition under
items 282(a) and 282(1), being paragraphs 3 to To inclusive,
of the petition should be dismissed. (notion for 8

irstancc is overshadowed by its applicability or rather inapplioability,
as a proper defense to the asserted claims. Asking for the revision of
a treaty because the consideration paid for the land ceded thereunder

is unconscionable, is not a claim arising under_the terms of the treaty,
but gxists in spite of the treaty solely because it is a new cause of
action created under Clause (3) of Section 2 of the Indian Claims Cour
mission Act. It was under this Act that Congress not only provided the
Power to litigate such a claim.hut admitted liability for same to be in

the United 3tates if the facts so warranted. Undoubtedly the treaty provisions form some basis upon which to brin such a suit by at least setS
ting the consideration yaid, if any, or oerhans determining the title

- . o
issue if such be the case. But this is not transformed into a Claim
arising under a treaty in which the snn.and.skmience of such a claim
zrist be contained wholly wit in its terms and asserted as a treaty coligation. Therefore, defendant‘s second defense is also inapplicable to

the claims asserted.

Part 2

 

Part 2 of defendant's motion is aimed at paragragh l7 of the petition in which there is set forth a twofold claim arising out of the hen
Echota Treaty of 1835 (7 Stat. 473). The eleventh article of the New

J.

Eonota Treaty provided that the annuity of $10,000 per annum due the

the claim asserted by the present petitioner for a pro rata share of the
treat" considerations. is was pointed out earlier in this opinion a
collection of individual rights are not converted into a tribal clain
simply because it is asserted as a class action by a subsequently organized group claiming in a representative capacity. Indian claims which
are substantially individual claims are not triable before the Commission
under the Indian Claims Commission Act. Petitioner's claim as asserted
under the New Echota Treaty of l835 falls into this category and shoul‘
be dismissed under defendant‘s motion as not stating a cause of action
under which relief can be granted.

Since defendant pled "res judicata" to this claim some comment

should be made upon the fact that what has been said concerning the individual character of the above asserted claim has been judicially determined in the case of the Cherokee Ration. et al.. V. United States: LO

C. Cls. 252 (l905), in which suit the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians
was a party plaintiff. In this case the liability of the United States
to the Eastern Band for a per capita distribution of the proceeds of the
ceded lands under the N'w Bchota Treaty was ascertained; judgment in
favor of the Indians having been rendered and affirmed on appeal hy the

Supreme Court. Q52 U.S. 101 (190617

Thus, even if the claim as presented by the petitioner would have
been triable under the Indian Claims Commission Act, "res judicata"
would have aoplied even though the prior judgment in the Court of Claims

had been favorable to the Indians.

Paragraph l8 of the petition is the object of Part 3 of defendant's
motion for summary judgrent. Here the petitioner band again asserts a
claim.arising out of the New Echota Treaty of l835 in which it asks the
Commission for a pro rata share of the taxgoco used by the Cherokee
Eation to purchase 800,000 acres of Kansaslhuns; the purchase money
according to petitioner being deducted from.the $5,000,C00'which the defendant agreed to pay the Cherokee Nation.for all its lands east of the
Mississippi River. (Art. 2, 7 Stat. #78)

In effect the petitioner band argues that in 1835, its ancestors

(who were members of the Cherokee Nation) “were joint owners of the lands

~.D

east of the Kississippi River at the timecnfthe taking of the same by

 

the defendant,“ for which lands the defendant agreed to pay'$6,000,0C0.
Since the sun of $500,000 was used to purchase the lands west of'the Eississippi River, and since, according to the defendant,'petitioner hand
hhas no interest, in these western lands, it is entitled to a "distributive

share of the said $50C0,000, which constitahaithe purchase price of said

lands.” Defendant in its motion argues that the holdings in the Cherokee

lands east of the Eississippi River in lS3S. They were bona fide nembers of the Cherokee Nation and were "communal" owners with all other
Cherokees having an indistinguishable and undivided common interest.
In like manner as previously discussed, merely selling these tribal
lands did not change the character of the proceeds of the sale. The
monies thus received constituted a1;ribal fund out of which the
”5OCO,COO was used in exchange for additional tribal lands west of ~
the Eississippi River. Thus, having no individual ri hts upon which

to demand a partition or division of tribal property at the time of the
l5;5 treaty, petitioner hand certainly acquired no such interest in
the Cherokee Nation'three years later. On the
contrary they forfeited all rights to the tribal or communal property
belonging to the Cherokee Kation,.and the only rights, if any, petitioner nay have retained in the property of the Cherokee Nation are
reserved in the Key Echota Treaty of l835, which treaty provisions are

benefit" of the Cherokee people, has no substantial foundation. (ll? U.3. p. 311)

There being no other grounds under the lndian Claizs Commission
Act cited by the petitioner under which the relief sought in paragraph
l8 could be adjudicated by the Commission, petitioner's present suit,
pleaded as a treaty claim, fails to state a claim upon which relief
can be granted, and should he denied as a matter of law under defendant‘s motion for s emery judgaent.

Paragraph 1? of the complaint sets forth a unique cause of ac—

the results of two Supreme Court cases. The first of these, United

(1993), determined what amounts were due to the ”Hestern Cherokees”
under the treaty of lEh6 (95tat. 871) as their share “per capita" in

great deal of friction and discord between the two factions of
Cherokees. Thereafter, the East and Uest became reunited as the
Cherokee Nation, adopting and ratifying a new constitution in l8LO.
Despite the apparent union of the Cherokee Ration bitter feeling
still persisted and thus in ldho the United States, “with a View to
the final and amicable settlement of the difficulties and claims”
concluded a new treaty in which the rights of all Cherokees, both

East and West, under the New Echota Treaty of 1335 were to be clarified, adjusted and settled. Under the provisions of Article A of the
l8&6 Treaty (also cited by the petitioner in its claim), the Restern Cherokees relinquisred any exclusive claim to those lands west

of the Hississippi River ceded to then under the Treaty of l328,

and such lands were to become the cozmon property of the whole
Cherokee Nation, and in addition the Cherokeeswest of the Hississippi
acquired a cormon interest in those lands occupied by the Cherokees

east of the Kississippi "which was not provided for in the treaty of

4.

1835” and whfch “therefore they have an eouitable claim.upon the

United States for the value of that interest, whatever it m_y be.”

It was then determined that in proportion to lastern Cherokees,

the ”Old Settlers" constituted l/3 of the new Cherokee Nation and that

from.the residiua of those mo.ies paid to the Cherokee Nation under the
Treaty of l335, after certain expenditures and charges had been deducv

The court ail-rned a final judgment in behalf of the Eastern Cherokees in the amount of $212,376.9h "together with interest thereon at the
rate of five per centun per annun from the lit; day of June, 1838.”
The petitioner’s ancestors were not a party to the 1846 treaty nor

was the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians a party litigant to the 1893

"Old Settlers” case. However, under the provisions of Article 10 of the

1846 treaty any rights which those Cherokees, residing in those States

east of the Kississippi River, acquired under the treaty of 1835 were to

.-.91‘

be preserved and not aliected in any degree.

Thus, in the second cause

cited by the petitioner band, United States v. Cherokee Nation,, 202 U.S.

 

101 (1906), those Cherokees who were east of the hississippi as of the
date of the New Eehota Treaty of 1835 and its 836 supplement, had their
' .1:

rights and interests adjudicated under the l8a6 treaty on an “account”

stated relative to the monies due for distribution after deducting proper charges from the residium of the treaty funds of l835-36 excluding, of

course, what had already been awarded the “Western Cherokees” under the

lS?3 "Old Settlers Case.“ Included within the Eastern Cherokee group and

made a party plaintiff to the suit as filed originally in the Court of
Claims were the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians identified in the suit

as the Eastern and Emigrant Cher Rees), who wish to assert a claim for a

pro rata share of the monies due to the Eastern Cherokees under the

of the Government to acknowledge liaeility'and pay on the account as stated
precipitated the aforementioned lawsuit by the Cherokee Nation against its

l8A6 treaty. The court held that in accordance with the provisions of
Article 9 of the 1846 treaty, payment of monies due to those Cherokees
residing east of the Hississippi as of the effective date of the 1835

treaty and the l836 supplement thereto, should be made "cor caoita, in

 

equal amounts to all those individuals, head of families, or their legal
representatives, entitled to receive the same under the treaty of l835,
and the supplement of 1836".

The sum finally determined to be due the Eastern Cherokees and the

petitioner band on th: account as st ted and anoroved by the court for a

nu

 

her caoita distribution -n accordance with the provisions of Section 9

   

of the l8L6 treaty was $l,lll,28A.7O (after deducting counsel fees, costs
and expenses).with interest at five per centu: per ann*e.from June l7,
1838 to the date of payment. In rejecting the contentions of the Eastern
hcnd for a pro rata share of the whole sum.due the Eastern Cherokees, the
court stated.
But we think they (Eastern Bend) are only entitled to receive the oer ceeita payment with the Eastern Cherokees and

should obtain that payment accordingly. (202 U.S. at page
132)

 

Petitioner band now desires in the present suit to lump together

the monies found due under both the "Old S;;tlers” case and the Cherokee

Fursuing this thou ht lo icall" it would seem to follow that petiL‘)

for that reason we are clainino the full amounts due under

payments made by the defendant, such payments to be applied
first to the payment of accumulated interest, and the balance

In its statement opposing defendant‘s motion for summary judgment,
petitioner argues the following on this point:

"By its claim ho. 282 Lo)(paragraph 19 of the Petition),
petitioner asks as an alternative claim that the defendant
be required to render an accounting, and if necessary to restate and correct the accounts, relative to certain sums

    

And further on petitioner states:

defendant a proper and correct accounting of these funds which

IESEE3""""‘“"“'"'“"‘"""""”"’"’

Hence if petitioner is correct, and there are monies due under a

'1‘?

judgment the remedy is a suit on the judgment, and petitioner's ma,g;«

mu.
m

§ati0HS in paragraph 19, being somewhat ambiguous, do lend themeelvas
to the; interpretation. Of course, under the Indian Claims Cozmisgitw:

Act: the Commission does not have jurisiiction to entertain a suit on

T

"Q

3“? final judgment nor to directly or collaterally set aside, alter or‘

interfere with a judgment rendered on the ncrits by the Court of Clainnu

7 Ind- Cl. Con. 140 ” 16¢

Therefore, if petitioner intended to plead a suit to enforce a deficiency,
if there be one, on judgments rendered by the Court of Claire, it must be
dismissed under the Indian Claims Commission Act for lack of jurisdiction
over the subject matter.

Another theory adaptable to the pleadings would frame petitioner's
claim.as an original cause of action asking a pro rata share in the
aforementioned judicial awards based first on tribal membership in the
Cherokee Nation as of l838 during which time said sums of money were due
and owing to the Cherokee Nation and, secondly, Section A of the treaty
of l8&6 as cited in the petition.

Houever, even if it be asserted in this manner the fundamental prin)

ciples of l w and prior court decisions heretofore discussed operate to

[1

defeat petitioner‘s claim. Upon withdrawal from the Cherokee Ration in
1838, petitioner's ancestors forfeited any tribal claim.to the common
property of the Cherokee Nation. The l835 New Eohota Treaty, and the

1836 supplement thereto are the source of the monies of which petitioner
bands seek a pro rata share in this claim. These funds, being the proceeds of the sale of the Cherokee tribal lands east of the Eississippi
River are the common property of the Cherokee Nation. What rights, if any,
petitioner's ancestors may have acquired in these common funds must be
found in t-e provisions of the l835 New Echpta Treaty, and its l836 supplement. Section l2 of the l835 treaty enabled those Cherokees adverse

o
.0to removal to share per capita in all personal benefits accruing under

 

said treaty. Thelshé treaty, to which petitioner‘s ancestors were not 3

party, they having departed from.the Cherokee Ration some eight years

7 1nd. C1. 09:. no 1535

prior thereto, reserved unaffected unto those Cherokees who had
chosen to remain east of the Mississippi, all rights acquired un—
der the 1835 New Echota Treaty.

The “Old Settlers” or ”Hestern Cherokees", who had moved west
across the Mississippi River to lands ceded to them in 1828, and who
‘were not parties to the New Bchota Treaty of 1835, and the "Eastern
Cherokees" who were parties to the 1835 treaty, and who in 1838 emigrated in a body to Cherokee lands west of the Mississippi River,
each had their rights determined in like manner to proceeds of the
sale of the eastern Cherokee lands, and each group was to share on
a per canita basis in the balance of these funds after stipulated
deductions had been.made. Thereafter, the rights of all the Cherokees under the foregoing treaties were judicially examined and fixed
under the decisiors in the aforementioned 1893 Old Settlers case and
the 1906 Cherokee Nation case.

The total amodnt awarded to “Old Settlers" subject to "per
capita" distribution was fixed at 1/3 the total proceeds, Reither
the “Eastern Cherokees" or petitioner's ancestors were parties to

the 1893 Old Settlers case nor did they have any interest in the

 

award made thereunder. Their interest lay in the remaining twothirds of the balance of the proceeds and their rights thereto were
judicially determined and fixed under the 1906 Cherokee Nation case.

The original suit in the Cherokee Nation case wasvfiled in the

party plaintiff (in a representative capacity fo

Cherokees).

In addition, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians was specifically
made a party plaintiff. The liability of the United States on the
accourt stated (which had been approved previously by the Cherokee
Nation) was affirmed by the court, and a favorable judgment rendered

on behalf of all plaintiffs fixed the total amounts due to these

Cherokees for per capita distribution of all monies due under the l835—36

 

New Echota Treaty. The suit, as adjudicated on the merits in the Cherokee Nation case to which the present petitioner band was a party, is

 

identical,with the claim in paragraph l9 of the petition, if said claim
were presented as an original cause of action. "Res judicata” would

J.

therefore apply barring the claim as a matter of law.
One other point raised by the petitioner needs particular comment. It is alleged that on the effectiveciate of the aforementioned

Office should have re.3

Supreme Court decisions, the General Accountin
stated the account to give, as petitioner contends, "the true status of
the several accounts and to give them the advantages and principals of
partial payments, bv first applying any pa"ment to the discharge of accumulated interest, and to apply only the suns in.excess thereof to the
interest bearing principal, etc." (Petition, p. 19)

In other words what the petitioner band is seeking is compound in4."

same account restated and for the same reason the present petitioner band now argues. The court ruled that the Cherokee Nation case
‘was a final adjudication on the merits of the claims presented
therein and the plaintiffs are barred to assert any new theory of
accounting upon which to change the end result of that case. The
present petitioner band, having admittedly been a party to the

Cherokee Ration case is in no better position to assert the same

 

argument in the present law suit. This issue as to correctness of
the account as stated upon which judgment was rendered in favor of
the petitioner band in the Cherokee Nation case has been finalized
on the merits and as a matter of law, is a bar to the instant claim.
In conclusion, defendant‘s.motion for summary judgment as to the
claim asserted in paragraph 19 of the petition should be granted. If
the claim be viewed as a suit on a former judgment, it should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter for it fails
to state a claim under our act for which relief can be granted. .If it
is an original cause of action for monies due under a treaty, it is
barred under the doctrine of "res judicata" by virtue of the decision

in the case of the United States V. Cherokee fationz et al., 202 U.S.

101 (1906). °
