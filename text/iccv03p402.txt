_” _ OPINION OF THE COMMISSION
0’Marr, Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Connission.

The Chickasaw are here suing for some $190,000, being the value of a
one—fourth interest in 25€.¥35.13 acres of land owned jointly by the
Chickasaw and.Choctaw Nations'of Indians which were allotted to Choctaw
Freedman pursuant to_treaties; thus taking one-fourth of such total
acreage from.the dhickasaw. '

‘On August 11, 1951t.#'_the._Gcvernment moved to dismiss npcn the ground
that the cause of action.pleaded in the petitionrherein is the same cause
of action.pleaded inta former case between the same parties which.was
decided adversely to the Chickasaw and is therefore £§§_judicata, citing
Choctaw Nation v. Jnited States and Chickasaw Nation; 318 U. 5. 1+2}, 87
L. Ed. 877 and 95 C. C15; 192. This contention of the Government makes

it necessary to examine the issues determined in the former case and

compare them with the facts pleaded in the present case.

, In the former case before the Court of Claims, 95 C. Cls. 192, the
Chickasaw“-‘sought an interpretation of the Agreement of March 21, 1902,
32 Stat. 6341, which would make the Choctaw or the Government liable for
the value of the Chickasaw one-fourth interest in 266,185.13 acres of the
land owned in common by the Chickasaw and ‘Choctaw which had been allotted
to Choctaw Freedman. Much evidence was offered purporting to show that
_by the 1902 agreement it was intended bylithe parties thereto that the

Chickasaw were to be paid for their one-fourth interest in the lands

allotted to the Choctaw Freedmen. Perhaps, the strongest evidence of C

such intention was the application of the Choctaw to Court of Claims to
have paid out ‘of an award made by that court for lands allotted the _
Chickasaw 3‘reedn~.en. the proportionate one-fourth interest of the Chickasaw
in the common lands allotted_to the Choctaw Freedman. (95 ‘C. Cls. 2014-5)‘.
But whatever the evidence was, the court understood it was inter- .
preting the 1902 agreement and it decided that the previous agreement,
being that or June 28,_1_8_98, 30 Stat. #95, and known as the Atoha Agreement, by which the Choctaw Freedman!-5 allotments were to be taken from_

the_Choctaw lands‘, was incorporated into the l9C2p agreement and t t the

Chickasaw were entitled to recover from the Choctaw f or one-fourth interest

in the lands allotted the Choctaw Freedman. That the Court of Claims was

interpreting the 1902 agreement is conslusively shown by these excewts
from its opinion:

It would have been strange for plaintiff to have, for no
reason which has been suggested, yielded its position on the
point of the Choctaw freednen‘s allotments in l902, after having
maintained it consistentl for so long. If it had so yielded
in 1902, it is impossible that the Choctaws would have, in 1909.

completed, sought to present to the Chichasat-rs a large sum of money
in compensation for the claim, at a time when the Chicicasaws were

not even represented by an attorney. We have no doubt that the
Choctaws understood the proviso as we have interpreted it. 

We conclude, therefore, that the arrangement of the Atoka
agreement whereby the Choctaw freedmen were to befurnished
their allotments at the expense of the Choctars and not of
plaintiff was incomorated into the supplemental agreement of
1902 aspen obligation of the Choctaw Nation.

'.Ehe_Choctavr and United States’, vrhojwere parties to the above case,
appealed to the Supreme Court and that court reversed. and ordered a dismissal of the Chickasaw petition, holding that the 1902 agreement was
plain and unambiguous and constituted the understanding of the parties.

‘Concerning the findings of the lower court, the Supreme Court_said:

* * "‘ Furthermore, if we were to find the ultimate fact, we
seriously doubt whether we could discover from these evidentiary
findings what the agreement among the two tribes and the ni ted
States was, if other than that expressed in the 1902 agreement.
For the’ most part the findings are concerned with the assertions
and claims of the Chicicasaws. The only indication that the
Choctaws ever shared those views at any time is their request
for an "Additional Decree“ upon which no action was ever taken.

Equitable considerations do not dictate a different resultl.‘ By the Treaty of 1366 both tribes shared in the $200,000 advance

payment for the adoption of their freedmen and the allotment of
forty acres of land to them. Even though the Chiclcasaws never

adopted their freedmen, they did receive a portion of their share
of the balance of the original $300,000 treaty fund. ‘.'.'hen they
contested the right of their freedmen to allotments the _‘EEo.ited
States explicitly promised in_the 1902 agreement to reimburse
them if there were an adverse judicial decision. The agreement
contained no promise to reimburse them for allotments to Choctaw
freedmen, and in view of_ the specific promise with regard to their
own freedmen, none should be implied.

r'i'i‘e conclude that éilotments from the common tribal lands were

to be made under the 1902 agreement to Choctaw freedmen without
deducting those allotments from the Choctaw Nation's share of t ==~

lands or otherwise compensating the Chicizasaws for their interest
in the lands so allotted. 0

Here again, it will be seen the Supreme Court was interpreting the 1902

agreement .

We come now to the allegations of the petition in the pendins case.

We have ‘examined the petition in the former case and find the allegations
substantially the same as those in the pending case, with one exception.

In the pending case there are added these allegations, being paragraph 21

thereof :

Petitioners Lllege that the taking of their lands for the _
settleznent of Choctaw Freednen thereon has been, from a LEGAL
standpoint only, decided adversely to then in the case of Choctaw
Nation of Indians vs. United States, 318, U. S. 672. They allege
however that the Indian Claims Commission Act, above referred to,
gives them a cause of action_u:pon the facts stated in this petition under clauses three and five, section two of the Act and

that the decision in the Choctaw Case, Supra, does-not constitute
res judicata, for the reason that the treaties of 1898 and 1902
were executed without any consideration whatsoever; and that the
facts were entirely misrepresented to the petitioner herein by
"reason of the language employed in the drafting of the treaty;
the clear understanding by both then and the Choctaw Nation,’
that the Chicicasaws would be adequately compensated for ther
interests in the Choctaw Indian lands. That there is also a

unilateralnistalce of fact and law.~as to the meaning of the

provisions of the Supplemental Agreement which the Court said
in the Choctaw Case, Supra, foreclosed then from legal relief.
Further such a denial on pure legislative construction violate

the provisions of this Act regarding “fair and honorable dealings“ between the parties.

In .

How what is the legal effect of these allegations? Obviously, there

is an attempt to avoid the bar of the former decision of the Supreme
Court and_it is alleged it is not'res- judicata ‘ffor the reason that the

treaties Efgreenentg of 1898 and 1902 were executed without any con?siderat ion whatsoever.” Evidently, the pleader intends to state that
those two contracts are void because without ‘consideration, yet a read-:ing of then shows mutual concessions and obligations of the parties, so‘

those allegations may be given no serious consideration.

It is next alleged that the facts were misrepresented to the Chickasaw
by reason of the language of the treaty, that the clear understanding of

the Chickasaw and Choctaw was that the Chickasaw would be compensated for

their interests in'the “Choctaw Indian lands,“ (we assume the Choctaw

lands allotted Choctaw Freedmen is intended) and that there was a. unilateral mistake, of fact and law "as to the meaning of the provisions of
the Supplemental (1902) Agreement}? Row 11-, is plain that 1: we were to
hear this case again we wouldhave to hear evidence as- to what was

intended by the Atoka (1898) and the Sunplemental (1902) agreements as

to ‘the Chicitasawfs compensation for its interest in the common lands

allotted the Choctaw Freedman.‘ C 

as has been shown above, the Court of Claims considered all the
questions now presented by -the pleadings here and decided that by. the
1902 agreement the Chiclzasaars were entitled to compensation but the
Supreme Court in passing upon the same facts as found by the Court of
Claims reached a contrary decision and ordered the case dismissed.

of course, can be no question but that the decisions above referred to

The Court of Claims in Choctaw; Ration v. United States, decided

, is a. case in point. That case was

commenced before the Indian Claims Comission seeking recovery f or

to pay the costs charged against the tribe for placing the members in
possession of their individual allotments. The Government pleaded
estoppel by reason of a decision of the Court of Claims, 91 C. Cls. 320,
and the Commission sustained the Government‘s defense and dismissed. the
claim.

On appeal, and in affirming the Commission, the Court of Claims
-said:

Appellant contends that the Atoka and Supplemental agreements were entered into under aunilateral or mutual mistake,
that the understanding of appellant at the time of negotiation
and ratification of the agreements was that appellee had, by
the agreements, assumedthe burden of payment of all expenses
incident to the administration and the carrying out of the
provisions of the agreements, and that but for such an understanding and belief appellant would not have entered into the
agreements voluntarily.- '

The first question presented is whether or.not the Indian
Claims Commission was correct in holding that the decision of
this court in Choctaw }Iation”v. United States, 91 C. Cls. 320,
certiorari denied 312 U. S. 695, was _1:_e_§_ gudicata.

The Indianclaims Commission mas of the opinion and appellee
here contends, that our prior decision is res judicata. That

the parties and the subj eet matter in the two cases are identi-Q
cal is not disputed. Appella.nt‘s position is that it does not

  seek to relitigate the issue of whether or not the agreements

imposed Uzitn the United States the obligation to pay the ex  penses in question, but that it seeks to revise the agreements

to so provide, on the ground oif unilateral or mutual mistake

as contained in clause (3) of Section 2 of the Indian Claims
Comission Act, sunra. Appellant contends that the question oi‘
unilateral or mutual mistake was not, and indeed could not have
been, litigated in the earlier decision of this cout, since at
that time the right to the revision of a treaty or agreement on
this or any other ground did not exist. ,

The question in the former case in this court was one of
interpretation of the agreements, in the light of the evidence
and contentions of the Choctaw Tribe as to the understanding of
the Indians and the alleged representations of the representatives of the Government who negotiated the agreements with the
tribe. There was involved nothing which required, as a condition
to the entry of judgment in favor of the tribe, a revision of the
agreements, and the claim was clearly one within our jurisdiction.
The question, in the last analysis, was whether the plaintiff tribe
in that case had submitted sufficient evidence, under the liberal
rule of interpretation which we recognized, to clearly show that
they had signed the agreements under a mistaken understanding as
to who should bear the expenses of handling and administering the
property and affairs of the tribe, or that the Commissioners
representing the Government had made representations at the time
of the negotiation of the agreements that had the effect of misleading the representatives of the Choctaw Tribe. Proof of a
clear misunderstanding by the tribe or misrepresentations on the
part of the Government is not different or more difficlllt than
proof of a unilateral or mutual mistake which appellant now
contends occurred. We do not thi& that th Indian Claims Commission Act intended that in issues so simiw the rule of _;_'§_s_
judicata should be ignored and the same or substantially the
same issues relitigated.

 

Appellee contends that not only are the parties and the
subject matter identi@, but that the issues sought to be
litigated in the present proceeding have been decided previously by this court, and that the decision of this court on the
merits of the case is therefore §_e_:_§_ E‘ dicata.

In the prior case appellant contended that the United states
was obligated under the Atolna and Supplemental agreements toibear
all expenses incident to carrying out the provisions of the agreements, and that any disbursements made from the funds of the
Choctaw Nation for that purpose were illegal and hence must be

reminded. The question before the court was thus one of interpretation of the an-eements.

We cannot agree with the contention of appellant, i. e., that
it is not seeking in this case to relitigate the same issue or
question presented and decided in 91 C. C15. 320, supra". In the
prior case this court had jurisdiction to determine the issue
presented as to the propriety of the charges made by the Government

against the funds of the Choctaw Tribe in the administration

of the affairs and properties of the tribe. The court approached
the question presented with the view that the Choctaw Tribe i
would be entitled -to recover if the evidence presented. by the

tribe was sufficient to show that they had been misled or overreached in the maldng of the Atoka and Supplemental agreements;

or if the tribe's evidence was'su_"c‘ficient to show that the
authorized representatives of the Government had made representations to the tribe, at the time of negotiation of the agree-‘
ments, upon -..-:hi-eh the tribe was at that time Justified in relying

as a promise that the Government would bear the costs and expenses
involved. ‘The court followed the well-recognized rule that treaties
and agreements with Indian tribes should, upon the whole record, be
liberally interpreted in favor of the Indians. We held in the prior
case that the tribe had not established its claim. In cases such
as this one brought before the Indian Claims Commission, claiming
unilateral or mutual mistake, a prior decision of this court of

r the merits of the same question, involving only the interpretation

of the agreement, weighing of the evidence, is peg gudicata. A

prior decision is not _r_e_s_ judicata if there was lack of jurisdiction or if revision of the treaty or agreement was necessary

to'a decision in favor of the Indian tribe ., _0__s__age Tribe v. United -_
States, 66 c. Cls. 614; Osge Nation v. United States, 119 c. Cls. 592,

520 {on appeal).

I S V I

In’ the prior case this court examined and considered all of the
facts then before it relating to the intent and understanding of the
parties, in an effort to interpretproperly the language which they
had used. Guided by the above precepts, and after full consideration,
we concluded that the understanding of the representatives of the
tribe and the real intention of the parties to the agreements was,
and that they therefore contemplated and understood, that the
Choctaw Natien was to bear the burden o:E‘_payment from its funds of
the expenses there and here in suit.

We think that this decision as to a fact which was material to
the issues than before us precludes appellant from again litigating the issue, notwithstanding the passage ‘of Section 2 of the
Indian Claims Commi ssion Act, supra. We are of the opinion that
the Indian Claims "Commission rightly held that the claim asserted‘
before it had previously been considered and adjudicated on its
merits, and that the prior decision was _r_e_§_ gudicata.

in 91 C. Cls. 320, and in the pendingpcase, and the actions in the Court
of Claims were under the same jurisdictional act, that of June 7, 192%,.
143 Stat. 537. Moreover, as has been shown above, the allegations of the
present petition set forth no claim that was not decided by the Court
of Claims and the Supreme Court in the former case, unless the allegations
respecting fair  honorable dealings present a matter not in issue in

the former case .

In paragraph 21 of its petition the Chickasaw allege: "such a denial
on pure legislative construction violate the provisions of this Act regarding ‘fair and honorable dealings‘ between the parties." we fail to
see how the fair and honorable dealings clause affects the interpretation of a‘ treaty. That clause concerns a substantive right, and where '
such right growsout of a treaty or contract we can conceive of no reason
in such cases, nor do we findtanything in the clause, requiring an interpretation different than that made by the Court of Claims. Furthermore,
as said by the Court of Claims in Blacicfeet et al. v. '0’. S., decided

March 2, 19514, 133 c. Cls. , on appeal from this Commission:

‘If a tribe was not entitled to recover ‘under any rule of
law or equity, it still might recover under clause (5); but if
its claim was reco ized b a rule of law or eouit. , then clause
R has no application.” Emphasis added . See also Osage v.

 

United States, ll9 C. Cls. 592.

    
     

 

In any event, therefore, clause (5) cannot apply.

Docket No. 263

Chief Commissioner Witt dissenting:

I cannot agree with the opinion of my colleagues that the motion of
the defendant for summary judgment should be sustained; on the contrary,

for the reasons hereinafter stated, I think the said motion should be

. denied.

In the litigation relied on by the defendant as being res judicata

of the claims herein stated, petitioner asserted a claim based on the

 

-Provisions of. the treaty of April 28, 1866, the Atoa-e Agreement of
April '23, 1897, and the supplemental agreement of March 21, 1902, all
between the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations and the United States. The
petitioner undertook: to secure such construction of said Eeement,
‘based on evidence introduced as to representations made and the understanding of the parties, etc., as would entitle the petitioner to recover. In the majority opinion herein it is stated that “the court (in

the case above referred to) Imderstood it was interpreting the 1302

gee.-rent" and it quotes from the decision of the Court of Claims in

support of the statement that the decisionof said CO1II't_W2.S an interpretation of the 1302 agreement. The Court of Claims decided that said

agreements should be interpreted as contended for by the petitioner and

that the petitioner should recover. The Supreme Court to shich said case

was appealed, by its decision held that "the 1902 agreement was plain and '

unambiguous and constituted the undertaking of the parties.” (Statement

in majority opinion herein). The Supreme Court in its opinion further

held t t’ “in so construing the proviso (in the instrument ofthe agreement involved) the Court of Claims relied. heavily upon certain findings

meaning of agreements with the Indians, negotiations, etc. may be looked

Justice or to achieve the asserted understanding of the parties." It
further held that the agreement was unambiguous and that its plain and
‘unambiguous provisions did not sustain the plaintiff s‘ contention; indicating however that had there been a finding (by. the Court of Claims) as

to the ultimate facts whether or not the two tribes intendedfto agree on

‘  something different from that appearing on the face of the 1902 agreement,.

a. different interpretation of such Eeement might be had.

It seems obvious to the writer that said decision was solely based
011 What ‘the Supreme Court said were the plain and unambiguous provisions
of the contracts ‘involved -- that is, solely as a. legal claim based on
instruments of agreement. As stated in the majority opinion herein,
the instant claim of petitioner is set out in paragraph 21 of its petition. This paragraph is set out in full in the majority opinion and shows

that petitioner is, in the instant claim, relying for its right to ‘recover

on clauses § and ’j_ of section 2 of the Indian Claims Commission Act. Each

'of these clauses provides a right to assert claims outside that provided

' - "':'¥'.;"‘.;-3 by the written words of agreements or treaties, which indicates that

petitioner does not rely on any legal claim that might be assertahle under

other clauses of Section 2, but relies solely and only upon things authorized by one or the other of said two clauses. The writer thinks that this

statement of the basis of petitioner's claims is conclusive as to same not
being legal claims butnclaims assertable only by reason of the Indian

Claims Commission Act and which were not available to petitioner at the time
of the treaty. The claim therefore involved herein does not question the
construction by previous litigation of the Atolcaand supplemented agreements
either by reason of its language or by reason of representations on understandings at the time, but petitioner accepts the construction as set forth
in the decision of the Supreme Court in the prior case and bases its claim of liability on the consideration of said agreement as ‘if revised on the

'\

61'0‘Imds of mistake, unconscionable consideration,. etc., as authorized

by clause 3%, which could not have been the basis of claim under the law '
at the time of the prior litigation; the petition also asks that its

claim be measured by the principles of fair and honorable dealings as
provided by clause 5 of said section 2,. which basis of liability was not
available to petitioner at the time of previous litigation.

My colleagues state that the ‘case of Choctawlifation vs. United States

decided by  com-.3 of Claims on May ‘-=..‘;~195lL,. 128 c, cis, is a case in

point, I disagree with them. In the opinion of the Court of Claims in

that case the court _said:

" * "' The question, in the last analysis, was whether the
plaintiff tribe in that case had submitted sufficient
evidence, under the liberal rule of interpretation which

we recognized, to clearly sho-.-: that they had signed the
agreements under a mistaken understanding as to who should
bear the expenses of handling and administering the property
and affairs of the tribe, or that the Commissioners repre.....__. ._..'.‘ ......—.-_..... . ..-—.

of the negotiation of the agreements that had the effect of

of a. clear misunderstanding by the tube or misrepresentations
-on the part of the Government is not different or more difficult than proof of a unilateral or mutual mistake which appellant now contends occurred; We do not think that the

Indian Claims Commission not intended that in issues gg

similar the rule of _r_e__s_ Qndicata should be ignored and the

same or substantially the same issues relitigated. ‘(Underscoring supplied.) "‘ * "' In the prior case appellant contended
that the United States was obligated under the Atoica and Supplemental geements to bear all expenses incident to carrying out
the provisions of the agreements, and that any disbursements
made from the funds of the Choctaw Nation for that purpose were
illegal and hence must be refunded. The question before the

court was thus one of interpretation of the ..eements. (Underscoring supplied.§ -Again in that opinion the court said:

Revision of the agreement involveduin the instant case is necessary
to _a decision in favor of the Indian flribes -— therefore, in Ina-eping
with theopinion in the above stated case the prior decision upon which
the plea of res judicata. is based is not res judicata.

is to the liability based on the yardstick of fair and honorable
dealings the Court of Claims in the Choctaw casemade no decision as to
the right of plaintiff in the alternative to assert such basis of
itassumed “that

liability because appellant has abandoned the contention

of violation_of the standard of fair and honorable dealings.”
'2he writer is of the opinion that the decision of the Comt of

Claims on appeal from a decision of this Commission in the Western (Old

3 1&5

 

31+

Settler) Cherokee Nation vs. United States, llh C. C15. 716, is squarely
in point and is decisive of defendant‘s motion herein. In the Western
Cherokee case the Government contended (as in this case) that prior
litigation -- similar to that in this case and under a similar jurisdictional act -- was res Judicata of the same case between the same
,parties. In that case the Court said:
"Our conclusion is that our former decision in our

case No. 142050, as c. Cls. #52, did not adjudicate such

claims as were created by the Act of l9H6, supra, and

did not exist at the tine of the decision of our No.

#2080. We have stated in this opinion ehet those claims

are. The granting (by the Indian Claims Connission) of

the Governnent‘s motion for summary judgment was, therefore,
erroneous. * ‘ * “ ' ' '

The writer'being of the opinion that the previous litigation relied

on as res judicata was based solely on petitioner’; contention that the
agreements involved entitled it to the release sought, but that the claimf

in the instant case is based not on the agreements as they exist, but

upon their consideration if renised, because of unconscionable consideration,
etc.; or by reason of failure to accord the petitioner fair and honorable

treatment, the motion of defendant for summary judgment should be denied.
