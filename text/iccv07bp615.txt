ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OE FACT

The Commission makes the following findings of fact which are
supplemental to the findings numbered 1 through 28 heretofore made
herein.

39. The Commission finds that the Nevada portion of the lands
ab°Ti8ina1ly'possessed by'the.Monos or Paiutes of Owens Valley (as
described in Finding No. 2l) was taken by the United States, without

Payment of compensation, on July ll, 1863. In the spring of 1862

hostilities broke out between some Indians in the southernmost area
and the miners and settlers. United States volunteer troops became

engaged in these hostilities. In mid-summer a peace was made and

shortly thereafter Indian Agent'Wentworth represented to the Indians.

that the Government would set apart a reservation for them.on Owens
River. Before a reservation was set apart, early in the spring of
1863, hostilities again broke out. At the close of these hostilities
United States volunteer troops removed a large body of the hostile
Indians to Tejon Reservation in California. Capt. Roper's report of
this removal published in a California paper in July 1863 states that
on July ll the troops “started for the Tejon Reservation with all the
Indians which had been gathered in, numbering about 1000 men, women
and children.“ Shortly thereafter the Indian Agent for the Southern
District of California reported that these Indians were delivered by’
the military to the Tejon Reservation on July 22, 1863. "In later years,
though most of these Indians returned to their iormer country, and continued generally to live in their former manner. Their presence there
did not interfere with such white settlement as there was.

30. “The Commission finds.that the Nevada portion of the lands
“b°r18inally possessed'by the Paviotso or Paiute of:westernLNevada
(as described in Finding No. 22) was taken by the United States,
without_payment of compensation on December 31, 1862. In 1859 the
Indian Agent in Carson'Valley and the Superintendent for Indian.Af4—
fairs for Utah territory commenced to plan the removal of Indians to

reservations from about Carson'Valley and the main east-west route of

travel. D:o_ring that year two tracts, one in the valley of the Truckee

at Pyramid Lake and the second on Wall-zer River and Walker Lake were

selected by the Indian Agent for this purpose. In November l8S9, the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs recoaaended to the Secretary of the Interior that these two tracts be set apart for Indian purposes. However,
in the spring of 1860 Indians who had congregated about Pyramid Lake

broke out into hostilities against white settlers. The hostilities

ended in August 1860 with an agreement between Colonel Lander and certain of the headrnen among the Indians that the Indians would abstain
from further hostilities for a period of one year. At approximately

the same time, a public notice was posted forbidding trespass upon the
Pyramid lake and Walker River lands. A year later, in July 1861, the
Indian Agent reported that the Indians had kept their agreement to re- 8
frain from hostilities. L Thereafter, during the summers of l86l and 1862,
a number of councils were held with the Indians at Pyramid Lake, Walker
River, and along the Humboldt by Indian Agents and the Governor of Nevada
to induce the Indians to settle upon reservations.“ A building was erected
 faI'm:'Lng commenced on Walker River. By the end of I862,  of the

Indians had expressed the desire to remain at peace, provided a reservation be set apart for their permanent home. On December 31, 1862, the

Pyramid Lake and Walker River reservations had come into operation and
had been accepted by a substantial number of Indians. later, in December
Of 18611 and January of 1865, these reservations were surveyed, and,

thereafter, under dates of March l9 and March 23, 18711, were established

by Executive Orders as reservations for these Indians.

The Cerrsnission finds that the Oregon and Nevada portions of

the lands aboriginally possessed by the Snake or Paiute of the Oregone
Area (as described in Finding No. 23) were taken by the United States, it
without payment of compensation, on September 12, 1872. On this date

the Executive Order which established the Halheur Reservation was

issued. This Reservation was established after a number of years devoted to efforts to remove, by force or by agreement, the Indians in

this northernmost area onto one or another reservation. The Malheur

Reservation was recommended by Major Otis in April _oi"'l872. Major

Otis proposed that it be occupied by bands of Paiute and Snake Indians
which ranged from John Day and Malheur Rivers to the Truckee River.

E-‘or a time after its establishment, the Falheur Reservation held promise
to become the permanent home for many of the Indians in this northern:.-zcst area. A number of Indians from this northernmost area moved upon R

the Reservation. However, administration of the Reservation changed;
