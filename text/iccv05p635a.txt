made in 1821 by the Y n York Indians from the Kenominee and

Winnebago Indians, to a point thereon north of the town oz
heukeca (Kauhaka) on the Eilwaukee river; thence south to
said Hilmaukee river at said town of Haukeca (Eauhaka)

said islands and the eastern shore of Green Bay towards
the present city of Green Bay and continuing along the
western shore of said Bay in a northerly direction towards the city of Escanaba, so as to exclude the waters

of Green Bay, to the point where the said shore intersects the northern line of Royce cession 2l9; Wisconsin

The Commission further finds that plaintiffs are entitled to an award
for the value of their one-half interest in said land as of date of September 23, 1822, less the credits and consideration they have received
