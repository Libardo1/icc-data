Decided: December 2, l9S?

The Commission makes the following findings of fact:

1. The S‘klallam (also known as the "Clallams") Tribe of Indians
are an ident'fiable‘tribe.o£'American.Indians residing, at least in part,
within the territorial limits of the United States along the southern
shores of the Straits of Juan de Fuca in.nhat is now the northwestern
portion of the State of‘Washington. The identity of this aboriginal '
tribe, as such, has been sufficiently established to meet the:requirements of the Indian Claims Commission Act of August l3, l9h6 (60 Stat.

10h9; 25 U.S. Code Sec. 70(a)).

they occupied Chimakur: territory and established a village at Port
Tot-Ins end. "

c. In Governor Isaac Stevens’ Report dated September 16, _l85h
by first Governor and e:>:-officio Supt. of Indian Affa;Zrs of Washington
Territory, to the U. 8. Commissioner of Indian Affairs, it is stated:
"I*Ee:.~:t to the Makahs are the Clallams, or as they call themselves

3. The Chimakum (also known as "Chem-a-kums"), although a separate
lingual group from the S‘ICLal1ams in aboriginal tinzes, were conquered
and merged into the S’K1allams , a powerful and warlike Sdish Tribe,
after having been reduced in numbers by the Snohomish wars in about 1.850..

This merger was in about 1857‘ after the signing but prior to the ratifi- cation of the Treaty of Point No Point, (Eallam Ethnography, Dr. Erna

Gunther, 1927, Dft. B21. 130) and the Chim.ak'u:r-.3 are eminct today as an
identifiable tribe,‘ group or band of Indians or«:ir.g to such merger in about
185? with the S‘Klalla*:1s. (Cynthia Larsen, I Tr. 17‘,-‘Lester Jackson, 1
'I‘r-.’l1..6; C*unther’s Ethn. Dft. E . LO). Gibbs is quoted by Dr. Curtis (Dft.
Ex. 11?, p. 1111) as reporting the Chimalcums as “numbering only ninety souls
in 1855 and formerly inhabited the peninsula between Hoods Canal and Port
Discovery, their villages in the main being situated on Port Townsend
and Port Ludlox-I.“ Petitioner herein asserts claim in its requested
Finding of Fact No. ll:(a) to such area because of previous occupancy‘ by
the Chimakuns since the “Chem-a-1<ums“ have lost their identity through
merger with S‘}CLalla:ns. (Pltf. Ex. 86, Quileute, Docket No. lSS).

1:. The petitioner and defendant stipulated at the openirg of the

initial hearing of this case as follows:

5 681:,

"There shall first be a determination of the matter of

the S‘Klallam Tribe of Indi ns versus the United States

of America, Docket ho. 13h, the question whether the claimants under the law and facts to be adduced, had, at the time

of the alleged wrongful acts by the defendant, aboriginal or
Indian title, within the meaning of the Act, to the lands
*described in the petition, or any part thereof, and if so,
whether the defendant unlawfully deprived the claimant thereof,
postponing until after such determination, should such determination be favorable to claimant, proof as to the value thereof, or as to any other question of fact raised by the pleadings

not heretofore determined by the Commission. (1 Tr. 2A)

5. The S'Klallam'villages, within the area of the United States, were
situated along the southern shores of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and extended in aboriginal tines from.the mouth of the Hoko (Okeho) River to
?ort Discovery.

6. Eleven S‘Klallam.villages were named in the caption of the Treaty

“‘

of Point No Point (12 Stat. 9333 II Kapp. o(u) and contained a total popul*tion of 926. (Stevens Report, March, 1857, Ma? 137, Tube 1033, Records
of the Office of Indian A.ffairs, National Archives)7- Both 5'Klalla_ms and Chimakurs were recognized, each as a tribal

entity, at the signing of the Treaty of Point No Point, "Chits-a-mak-han,

the Duke of York, Chief of S‘}CLallams" and “Kul-kak-han, or General Pierce,.

Chief of the Chem-a-kum3 were so designated in the signing of the treaty.
The Chinakums had a population of lOO, Stevens noted in his report of the
negotiation of this treaty.

(Dr. W.:-.-yne Prescott Suttles' testimony, II n-. 17)
9. The Chimakums occupied the area from.Port Ludlow'around to Port

Townsend, having their two principal villages at these respective points,

and some also were at Port Gamble (Dft. Ex. h?, p. lhl; Dr. George Gibbs

Report (Dft. Ex. 6, p. lél).

10. The princi“=l food of the S‘Kl llans was fish, included also were
clams, roots and berries, sea-food.constiuuted the major diet and was the
principal cultural influence. Although.the lands were fertile, but heavily

wooded, the ease with which food could be obtained from the sea left little

or no incentive for agriculture or penetration of the dense forests for the

flesh of 1and.animals. (Dr. Eds. Curtis, “The North American Indian"; Dft.

G‘!

ex. h7, pp. 19-20).

ll. Hunting was of least importance to the S‘Klallams in aboriginal
times. Most of their hunting was done by chasing the deer and elk, which
seasonally came onto the flatlands, out to sea and chasing the animals in
canoes until the animals died of exhaustion. (Br. Erna Gunther "Klallam
Ethnography,“ 1927; pp. 201-20, Dft. *2. E0). 0

l2. ne American ?ranch of the 5‘Klallans fished off the southern

shores of the Strait of cuan oe -uca and on the Hoke River, Clcll .

Pisht River, Elgzha River, Dungteness River and on Port Discovery Bay,
all located on or running into an eighty mile stretch of shore line of

the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The Chimalcum fished from Port Ludlow Bay,

Port Gamble, Port Townsend and at Port Discovery Bay. (C-unther’s
Klallam Ethn., p. 177).

The S’Klallam root beds and berry patches were located in close

proximity to their villages on the coastal flatlands, or vice versa. The

S'Klalla::~.s dug clams along the bays and inlets away from the rough waters
oi‘ the Straits. (Cynthia Larsen, 1 r. 9).

l3. Petitiomr originally clai.-..ed an area of land generally bounded
on the north by the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and commencing at the mouth
of the Ho}-co River, from a point 5 miles west of Clallam Bar ; thence southeastward to the corner of Range 7 west, I'.7.W.21I._, township 23 north; (apparently in reference to the peak of Hurricane 1-Iill); thence east to the

S‘Klallam (Old Chi:::ak.um) land areas, as follows:

Commencing at Hood Head, near the mouth of Hood Canal,
thence generall '.»:'estward along; the watershed of those
streams draining into Hood Canal to the watershed of t.e
Dungeness and Big Cluilcene rivers; thence generally southwestward along the eastern surrrnit of the O1 “pic Range in
such a way as to define the watershed of those streans
emptying into Hood Canal on its west side, including the
Sko-konish River and its tributaries, following the height
of land between the he adraters of the 33-cokomish and its tributaries and the Satsop River.....(Plf.. Pet. Dkt. 295)

1?. Petitioner amended its petition with respect to land areas claimed

-Par. III) over the objections of the defendant that such amendment was
barred by limitations, On Iiovenber 15, 1955, this Commission, having overruled the objections of defendant, permitted petitioner. to paste such
amendment over the original Par. III of the petition. This amendment
alleges the south boundary to be some fifteen miles farther south than
originally alleged and encompasses the Bolton Peninsula and Iondos Peninsula, Port Gamble and Foulreather Bluff areas, and reads as follows:

Commencing at the raouth of the Hoko.River, thence to the

town of Sappho; thence to the peak of Ht. Olympus; theme to

the peak of 1‘-‘St. Anderson; thence to the north point of Quilcere

July 6, l9S6, petitioner filed a disclaimer "of all lands west of
a line which follows the crest of the Olympic Mountains around the
source of the Hoh River to the peak of Mt. Olympus, thence following the
crest around the source of the Queets River“ and naming Mt. Olympus as an
exception to the disclaimer and.referred to Dr. Ray's map (EX- 72, D0CkBt
155) as showing the proper boundary west of Mt. Olympus.

18. Hunters of various tribes of Indians on the Olympic Peninsula
jointly used the Cascade Mountain.range area for hunting deer, elk,-and
bear and these mountains and this area is not included as the property

of petitioner in Finding l9. (Dr. Carrol L. Riley; III Tr., p. 1173

»Lester Jackson, I Tr. pp. 28-29).

19. The S‘Klallam.Tribe of Indians, toaether'with the Chineddnn

\

Tribe, which had.merged with then, used and occupied an area of land.in
aboriginal times described as follows:

Commencing at the mouth of the Hoke River and following up

IEORH AND SOUTH BOUNDARIES:

The south boundary of Territorr exclusively occupied by Sklallam

Indians was the mountains “to their back“ and their north boundary'4as

Ex-> 3-10 at 13- 178) in 1927' and notes Gibbs and Curtis‘ respective reP0I“?»S of 5‘EG.allam villages all situated at the mouths of the rivers

and b32578 along the southern coast of Juan de Fuca, viz: Ho}-:o River,
Clallan Bay, Pysht Bay, Eh-:rha River, west base of Ediz Hook, Danger.-.ess
River, New Dungeness River, Sequim Bqf, Port Discovemr Bay, Port ‘foamsend and Washington Harbor. i Gunther also observes (Id. p.'20h) "hunting
is of least importance, economically, to S‘Klallam. What litt...e is done
is carried on at sea rather than on land. The mountains back of the

Fflallarn. territory are kno'v.'n only to a few hunters who go there for ell:

scale is done if an elk or deer or bear is seen 3-:'all<.:"_n.g on the beach. The
people chase the animal into the water and follow it in a canoe until the
animal dies of exhaustion." (Id. p. 205).

Dr. V. 17‘. Ray in "The Sanpoil and Nesmlem" (1933) seems to singularlydisagee with Gunther, stating that he had “several reports" that
hunting grounds were divided among nobles, commoners, and slaves of

Northx-rest Tribes. (Dft. Ex. 38). However, Dr. H. G. Barnett observed on

~ 

the Salish coast that the dense undergrowth topped by heavy‘ stands of

-conifers made penetration to the higher mountains very difficult and

“foreign to the genius of.‘ their culture (fishinr-')." (Dft. BX. 155:)

f. Dr. Ronald l.. Olson in his study of "The Qminault Indians“ (1936)
repcrts (Dft. Ex. 52, p. 13) "The Heights above the sources of the river
(off the southern coast) were more or less common hunting territory for
Quinault, Skokomish, ICLallam and Queets.“

defi ed linear boundaries or frontiers to the T1-:a.-a County; boundaries
correspond generally to sometimes extensive watershed areas.“

original country embraced Port Townsend, Port Ludlow and Port Gamble."
(Deal Ex. 81, p. 177).

observed about sixty Skokomish at head of Hood’s Canal. (Id. p. 228). :1. Dr. Edward :5. Curtis in "The North American Indian" (19:13)
