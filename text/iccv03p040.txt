Holt, commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.

The two claimant goups of Pottawatomie Indians set forth in the

above title separately presented almost identical claims of the Pottewatomie Tribe of Indians against the United States, arising out of

the disposal of lands in the Tribels reservation in eastern Kansasunder the treaties of Hovember 15, 1861, 12 Stat. 1191 and February 27,

1867, 15 stat. 531, and by the Act of congress of July 1, 1862, 12 Stat.

1!-89:. The claims asserted by both claimant groups are for and on behalf

of the Pottawatomie Tribe, so in considering them they will be treated
as claims of the Pottawatomie Tribe, regardless of which group asserted

the claim. The claims as set forth in either or both of the two petitions are as follows, and will be considered in that order:

1. A claim for the fair value as of August 7, 1868 of 338,766 .82

acres of the surplus lands in the Kansas reservation which were sold

  2. A claim for payment of the difference in value between the
  price paid for the above surplus lands, and $1.25 an acre payable in
 gold or silver coin, as required by the 1861 treaty.

3. A claim for Just compensation for 1556.80 acres of the reservation lands, alleged to have been granted the Leavenworth, Pawnee
and Western Railroad as a right-of-way by defendant, under the Act. of
July 1, 1862, without the consent of the Pottawatomie Tribe or payment of compensation therefor.

surplus lands in the Reservation alleged to beunaccounted for by

the defendant .

5. A claim for the value of 6340 acres of the Reservation con‘ veyed to two missions on the Reservation.

5. A ‘claim is also made for additional compensation for 1013.51;

acres of surplus land in the Reserve sold to three individuals under

the terms of the 1867 treaty.

He will hereinafter, for convenience, refer to the claimant group
in Docket No. 15-3 as the "Prairie Band“, and the claimant group in
Docket No. 111 as the "Citizen Band“. These two Bands are the only

Bands of Pottawatomie Indians whose members have an interest in the

above claims .

by the fair market value on Angst 7, 1868, of the 338,766.82 acres of
Kansas Reserve surplus lands sold to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fe.Railroad Company at $1.00 per acre in lawful money or the United
States, under the provisions of the 1867 treaty.

The Pottawatomie.Reservation in Kansas, comprising some 576,000
acres, was acquired by the Pottawatomie Tribe from the United States,
under Article It of the treaty of June 5 and 17, 18% (9 Stat. 853) .
A.considerable amount of space in the briefs has been devoted to the
provisions of this l8N6 treaty, particularly to the promise of the
Government to give the Pottawatomie Indians "all proper care and parental protection" and its guarantee making the Kansas lands "as their
land and home forever". Aside from the fact that the claim for the
surplus lands is not, by the petitions herein, based upon any viola~
tions of that treaty, the disposal or acquisition of Indian lands by
treaty with the tribal occupants is not in itself a violation of a
treaty guarantee of perpetual occupancy, in fact the Government by
its plenary power over tribal lands may take or dispose of them withr
out the consent of the Indians. Lone'Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S.
553. Here the Pottawatomie Tribe entered into two treaties, those
of 1861 and 1867, by which they provided for the disposition of
their surplus lands and it cannot be said they were barred by the
ISM6 treaty from.doing so, or that the Governnent violated any duty
it owed the Indians under the provisions of that treaty in dealing

with than for the sale or other disposition thereof under the quoted

provisions.

Another curious feature of this controversy has been injected by
the Prairie Band. They contend in their briefs that the Prairie Band

was not a party to either the 1861 or 1867 treaties and their interest

in the surplus lands was not ceded. This contention is odd to say the

least. As we read.their petition (15-B) they, the individual members
of the Pottawatomie Tribe and the Pottawatomie Tribe claimed and asked
compensation for all the land, 338,795.82 acres, patented to the Santa
Fe Railroad Company. The petition clearly purports to assert a claim

on behalf of the Pottawatomie Tribe and this purpose is shown by the
findings of fact proposed by the Prairie Band and the Citizen Band
Jointly. We find nothing in their petition indicating any rights of the
Prairie Band different from those of the Pottamatomie Tribe of which they
are and were members with respect to the surplus lands here involved, nor
has the Prairie Band alleged any rights that are special to that group.,
Without going into details, we believe the record is quite plain and
shows that the Prairie Band consisted of those Pottawatomies who

decided to hold their lands in common, as they were permitted to do

‘under the terms of'the 1861 treaty, rather than take individual
allotments. The grouping did not_create a separate political entity
of Prairie Band and they acquired no rights in the surplus lands any
different from those of the Citizen.Band, who constituted those

Pottawatomies who decided to take individual allotments. The fact

that 77,357.67 acres of the Kansas Reserve were set apart and accepted
by the 780 members of the Prairie group in one body to be held in
common, or the allotments aggregating 152,128.98 acres to lhOO individual.Pottamatomies comprising the Citizen group, does not change the

tribal status of the surplus lands, that is, the Prairie group did not
thereby acquire any rights therein other than the right to receive its
pro rata share of the proceeds from the sale of the surplus lands, as

provided by Article 1 of the l86l treaty. In using the phrase "pro

rata share”, we construe it to mean 780th of 2180 parts of such proceeds._

This ratio was agreed to by the‘Prairie and Citizen groups on July 18,
1393. (Def. EX. 33,IDkt. 15-35. ‘So we must hold that the surplus
lands, when sold to the Santa Fe Railroad, belonged to the Pottawatomie
Tribe and that neither band had any interest therein, except as members
of the tribe and the right to share in the proceeds from the sale thereof as groups, rather than on a per capita basis.

tie to the contention that the Prairie Band never was a party to
the 1861 and 1867 treaties and hence, are not bound thereby, may we
point to the unquestioned fact that the very right they acquired to
the 77,357.67 acres in the Kansas reserve, and which they have since
held in common, passed to them by virtue of the 1861 treaty, the one
they now disclaim. Furthermore, they have received all the benefits
of the l$67 treaty, consisting of their pro rata share'of the proceeds
from the sale of the surplus lands of the Pottawatomie Tribe. Also,

by the agreement of July 18, 1876 (Def. 3:. 33,.Dkt. 15-3), the Prarie

‘Band, in effect, ratified the 1861 treaty. of course, the apparent

purpose of the Prairie group in disclaiming participation in the two
treaties is to bring their claim, although not so asserted in their
petition, within the protection of the Fifth Amendment and obtain

the equivalent of interest as a part of just compensation. we know of

claim.under the recond in this case.

In any event, the record is plain. The surplus lands belonged
to the Pottawatomie Tribe, and it was that tribe which sold the surplus
lands to the Santa Fe Railroad by the 1867 treaty. The fact that some
members of the Prairie Band opposed the sale, or that no member of
that Band joined in the treaty, is of no legal consequence because,
as we have stated above, the Prairie group, as such, had no title to
the surplus lands. So we conclude the Prairie Band's recovery herein
must be confined to their "pro rata” share of any award.

We come now to the crucial question in the case insofar as the
surplus lands are concerned, that is, whether the Pottawatomie Tribe
is entitled to recover. The claimants rely upon.two grounds: (1)
that the defendant did not deal with the Pottawatomies fairly and
honorably in promoting and negotiating the sale by them of their
surplus lands to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Company
(for brevity, we have heretofore and will hereafter refer to thiss
Railroad as the "Santa Fe"); and (2) that the consideration of one
dollar per acre in lawful money of the United States was unconscionable.

As customary in cases such as this, much space is used on both
sides on the question of the relationship existing between the Indians
and the United States. Such efforts on the part of counsel are necessary and commendable, but this question has been exhaustively discussed by the court of claims and the Supreme Court, so we shall do

no more than refer to excerpts from a few of the decisions.

The Court of Claims in Chickasaw v. United States, 9% C. Clms.

215, 23h, described the relationship existing between the Indians and

the Government as follows:

'This_is especially true in view of the fact that
between the defendant and the plaintiff there existed a

relationship similar to that of guandian and ward. bThe
defendant had all the power; it could take such action
as it saw fit. The very fact of that relationship calls

for the utmost care to see that all the legal rights of
the Indian tribes were protected."

And in United States v. Payne, 26h'U. S. U36, U48, the Supreme Court

said:

‘They (Indians) are an unlettered people unskilled
in the use of language * * * with regard to whom the
United States occupies the position and assumes the

s responsibilities of virtual guardianship, bound by every
moral and equitable consideration to discharge its trust

with good faith and fairness.“ ‘

,And the same Court, in Seminole Nation v. United States, 516 U. S. 286,

further elaborated on the relationship by saying:

Qrurthermore, this Court has recognized the distinctive obligation of trust incumbent upon the Government in.its dealings with these dependent and sometimes
exploited people. * * * In carrying out its treaty obligations with the Indian tribes the Government is something
more than a mere contracting party. Under a humane and
self—imposed policy which has found expression in many acts
of Congress and numerous decisions of this Court, it has
charged itself with moral obligations of the highest responsibility and trust. Its conduct, as disclosed in the
acts of those who represent it in dealings with the Indians,

should therefore be judged by the most exacting fiduciary
standards.” .

So we see that contracts, such as treaties, between the United
States and the Indians may be scrutinized to determine whether the
Government followed the fiduciary standards imposed upon it when dealing with these dependent people.»

The evidence in this record in voluminous. To review it all
would extend this opinion beyond reasonable limits, so we shall confine this opinion to a summarization of the evidence.

‘ The Pottawatomie Indians, prior to l8M6, was composed of many
widely separated groups or bands which the Government had dealt with
and as a result of such.widespread dealings concluded that these
groups should be united in one common country. ,As a result, the
Pottawatomies and the United States concluded the treaty of June 5,
17, l8M6, supra, by which the Government sold the Indians 576,000 acres
of land in Kansas (Royce, Tract M33 and #33, Kansas Map 2). Two
thousand one hundred eighty“Pottawatomie Indians finally removed to
and were united on this reserve and were living there and held their
lands in common until 1861. This Reserve consisted of very desirable
land for agriculture and it was thought by the Government that the
Reserve was much larger than necessary to provide the needs of the
2,180 Pottawatomie Indians residing thereon. Considering the Indians
as agriculturists, this was perhaps true but while many of them had
progressed in their civilization most of them needed and depended
upon the assistance and protection of the Government. This was true
to a greater extent of the Prairie group which‘was composed largely
of the wilder and less civilized part of the Tribe, however, there
was much opposition to the sale of the surplus lands by parts of
both divisions of the Tribe.

The Indians had been established but a short time after their

removal from their Iowa lands to the Kansas Reserve when agitation

started for making all or part of the Kansas land available for white
settlement, in fact, the record shows that the Act of March 3, 1853,
10 Stat. 225, 238, was the initial step in carrying out a plan to gain
consent of the Indians west of the States of Missouri and Iowa to the
settlement of whites upon lands claimed by the tribes residing there,
and for the purpose of obtaining relinquishments of Indian title to
all or part of such lands. The Act applied to the Pottawatomie Tribe.
Kansas became a territory in 185% and was striving for statehood,
but the small population interfered with that ambition, so there was
a great deal of local pressure on the Federal Government to open
Indian lands for settlement in order to induce settlers to migrate to
Kansas. Another part of the plan to.acquire western Indian lands
arose from the £act that the acquisition of the western lands from
Mexico in l8h8 cansed an ever increasing migration of whites to the
west, necessitating safe travel routes through Kansas and other states
to this newly acquired domain. All of the above contributed to the
pressure on the Indians by the Government to restrict the Pottawatomie
holdings in.Kansas to greatly diminished areas. This was eventually
accomplished after much opposition by the Indians.

The treaty of November 15, 1861, 12 Stat. 1191, was the first
step in the consummation of the plan mentioned above, and resulted
in 1400 of the Indians taking allotments aggregating l52,l28.9M acres
(citizen.3and), and the Prairie Band taking 77,357.67 acres of'un~
alloted lands to be held in common, thus leaving some 31!-6,513+ acres

as surplus lands, that is lands not alloted to individuals or

specifically retained for common occupancy.

By'Article 5 of the 1861 treaty the Pottawatomie Tribe agreed
to give the Leavenworth, Pawnee and western Railroad Company the
Rprivilege of buying", the surplus lands at a price of $1.25 peracre
payable in gold or silver coin. This is a remarkable document in

several respects, but particularly as it concerns the sale of the

surplus lands. The Article recites as a reason for giving the abovenamed Railroad Company the privilege of buying the surplus lands, that

the construction of the railroad would enhance the value of the lands

I retained by the Pottawatomies and also provide a means of getting

their surplus produce to market.

It would be a strain on our credulity to accept the language
appearing in Article 5 as that of the Pottawatomies. To attribute
to these Indians an appreciation of enhancement of land values on
transportation facilities for their surplus produce through the construction_of a railroad would place them on an intellectual level

with their white advisers. That these Indians

This we cannot do.
understood they were parting with their surplus lands is to be believed, but it would be preposterous to say they considered the railroad as of economic value. Indians traditionally and naturally desire
to keep their homelands, and there is nothing in the record indicating
the production of surplus crops was in the contemplation of the Indians
in 1861,

The option of the Leavenworth, Pawnee and Western Railroad Company

for the purchase of the surplus lands never was taken.up for on

successor to the Leavenworth, Pawnee and Western.Railroad, notified

the Secretary of the Interior that it declined to purchase the surplus

lands. mhe above transaction is only important as showing the course

b of dealings starting in 1861 and which were concluded in 1868.

As early as 1862 we find that pressure was being exerted on all
Indians in Kansas to move to the Indian territory, now Oklahoma. ‘At
that time the Pottawatomie Tribe constituted one of the largest, if
Even though.the Pottawatomie lands
were then in the process of being alloted under the 1861 treaty, plans
for a new treaty providing for the removal of the tribe to the Indian
country were under consideration by the Government and throughout
the ensuing;years and until the 1867 treaty was negotiated efforts
to remove the Indians were made, resulting in the execution of the
1867 treaty.

The treaty of February 27, 1867, 18 Stat. 531, was concluded on

that day in.Washington. While no member of the Prairie Band group
seems to have been one of the representatives of the Tribe who signed
it, nevertheless, it was made by the Pottawatomie Tribe and provided
for the sale of the surplus lands to the.Atchison, Topeka and Santa

Fe Railroad Company; The treaty also provided for the removal of all

the Pottawatomie Indians desiring to leave Kansas to the so-called
Indian country,_and provision.was also made for the acquisition of

lands in Oklahoma for the Tribe for the'use of those members desiring

to move.

AS we read the record, the conditions of the Pottawatomie Indians
in.Kansas was an unhappy one from the time of their location there.
The people of Kansas did not want them; they wanted their fine lands
opened for white settlement. White people trespassed upon their lands,
confiscated their personal property and in numerous instances showed
an utter disregard for Indian rights, leaving the Indians without protection and without redress. Here is a graphic report of the situation
of the Indians made by the Pottawatomie Indian agent in 1867:

" * * * The white man (where an Indian only is concerned
against him) with a high hand possesses himself of what

he claims to be his,.while the Indian must patiently suffer
an infringement of his rights, or:resort to force, in which,
however just his cause may be, he is sure to be beaten.
Property has been taken by whites, which was notoriously the
property of an Indian. I have applied in behalf of,the '
Indian to the United States court for redress, and been
told, ‘the offence not having been committed upon an Indian
reserve, the United States court has not jurisdiction.‘
‘Applying then to the State courts, it was determined that
inasmuch as the Indian was not a citizen of the United States,
or of the State of Kansas, he had no right in the courts of
the state to redress his grievances. However unjust or unwarranted such a decision, the fact and difficulty remain.“

This agent thought the only solution was the removal of the Indians to
another place and other Indian agents expressed the fear that serious
consequences would result from the increasing friction between the
Indians and the whites.

It was in this atmosphere that the Pottawatomie Indians finally
agreed to their removal to dklahoma by the 1867 treaty. It is not
too much to say that such.removal was their only escape from.the'untoward conditions created by the white man whose Government by the

1836 treaty promised the Pottawatomie Indians "proper care and parental

The crux of our inquiry is the determination of the question:

Did the Government assume or incur any liability in making a treaty ,
with the Pottawatomie Tribe by which the Indians were induced to
accept one dollar per acre for their surplus lands if said lands were
worth substantially more at the time of the treaty?

As we have already stated, the claimants rely upon two grounds
for recovery, namely, unconscionable consideration (clause 3 of
Section 2 of the Indian Claims Commission Act) and fair and honorable
dealings (clause 5 of the Act). We will therefore consider first the
question of the value of the surplus lands on.Angust 7, 1868. This
was the date the 1867 treaty, providing for the sale of the lands,
was proclaimed by the President, and all parties are in agreement
that the fair market value of the land should be determined as of
that date.

The claimants contend the fair market value of the 338,766.82
acres of surplus lands was at least $h.50 per acre on August 7, l868,
while the defendant maintains it was not worth.in excess of the $1.00
per acre paid for it by the Santa Fe Railroad Company.

The Pottawatomie Reservation was a thirty mile square tract of
land located in eastern Kansas, and occupied a part of four counties,
namely, the northeast corner of Wabaunsee, the southeast corner of
Pottawatomie, the northwest corner of Shawnee, and the southwest

corner of Jackson county. The Kansas river flows in an irregular

course_from east to west through the reservation, and about two-thirds
of the reservation lies north of the river. The climate is mild and
normally there is enough rainfall to produce wheat, corn and other
small grain crops. In the period from 1860 to 1868, Kansas suffered
from drought conditions.but from 1868 to 1873 rainfall was normal.
The Pottawatomie Reserve area contained two general types of soil
described as upland and bottomvland. The upland is partly arable and
part non-arable and about 85 percent of the surplus land was upland.

The State of Kansas was admitted to the Union in 1861, and although development of the.State was retarded during the civil War,
immigration to the State increased rapidly after the War. In 1860 T
the population of Kansas was l06,390 and by 1870 had increased to
3h6,377, mostly concentrated in the northeastern section of the
State. The population of Shawnee county increased from 3505 in 1860
to 12,032 in 1870. During the same period Jackson County's population increased from 1936 to 5937, and In Pottawatomie county from
l529 to 7255.6 A,number of cities and towns bordered the Reservation,
the Capitol city of Topeka abutting it on the southeast, and Manhattan 17 miles west of the Reserve. Numerous colleges, banks,
newspapers and churches were in operation in the State prior to 1868.
By October 7, 1366, the Union Pacific Railroad Company had completed
ta railroad across the Reservation, which extended from Topeka west
to Pawnee, Kansas. 6

The parties on both sides in this case have submitted a large

large part of which consists of private sales in the four abovementioned counties in which the reservation is located, sales of

their selections of individual allotments, totaling l52,l28.9H acres,

they selected generally the more desirable reservation lands. This
would, in part, account for such a small percentage of bottom lands
being available for sale to the Santa Fe Railroad.

During 1868 there were h2,795,590 acres of public lands in
Kansas available for homestead or preemption entries by the public,
of which 23,906,087 acres had been surveyed. .All such land was
subject to preemption at $1.25 per acre, while homestead entries
were permissible on surveyed land.

Sales of other large tracts of unimproved Indian lands in eastern
Kansas were made a few years prior to 1868. One was the Sale in 1361
of 223,966.78 acres of the Delaware Trust lands at their average appraised value of $1.28 per acre, but requiring the purchaser to build
a railroad through the Reserve. These lands were located about 15
miles east of the Pottawatomie lands along the Kansas river. The
evidence shows these lands contained slightly better soil.

.A tract of 92,610.25 acres of the Delaware Diminished Reserve
Lands was sold to the Missouri Pacific Railroad-'Compa.ny in 1866 at
the appraised value of $2.50 per acre. This_tract was in a more
highly developed area of Kansas to the east of the Pottawatomie lands
and.near the Missouri river. It had two railroads crossing it at the
time it was sold. 0

The tract of 800,000 acres known as the Cherokee Neutral Lands
located in the southeast corner of Kansas was appraised in 1867.

Some of the land.was occupied but the major part was not. The

‘unoccupied unimproved part of 6HO,l99.69 acres was appraised at an
average price of about $1.1L0 per acre for sale in small tracts, ‘but
was sold later as a unit for $1.00 per acre. This land had no rail»
road through it but was more fertile and received more annual rainfall than the Pottawatomie lands.

The claimants have submitted two exhibits (15-B-3 and 3-H) in
which are listed the abstracts of 5,153 deeds showing the -sales in
small tracts and prices paid for such land in the four counties of
Waubaunsee, Pottawatomie, Jackson.and Shawnee, Kansas, covering the
period from January 1, 186% to December 31, 1872. The land covered
by these deeds was scattered throughout the four counties and in the
Reservation.

These deeds were classified by claimants! expert witness as to whether the land covered by each deed was improved or unthe assessment records of the four counties for either the year 1871
or 1872...As the assessors original records were missing in Pottawatomie and Shawnee counties and some townships in the other counties,
the assessment rolls were examined and the witness made his deduction
as to whether a tract of land was'unimproved by considering its total
assessed value, location, soil, and comparison.with.adjoining lands.
By this method it was determined that of the 5,153 sales listed,
4,710 were sales of unimproved lands and only #43 were sales of improved land. I I .

The h,7l0 sales so classified as unimproved land, totaling

699,06l.Oh acres, lying both inside and outside the reservation,

indicate an average sale price of $5.81 per acre and a median price of
$5.63 per acre. 0f the h,7l0 such.sales, there were 3,55% sales outside the reservation, totaling M97,697.5l acres, at an average price
of $6.06 per acre; 601 sales by private parties of 62,253.83 acres
within the reservation at an average price of $9.23 per acre; MR5 sales
in the reservation by the Pottawatomie Indian allotees, totaling
h0,8M6.33 acres, at an average price of $5.37 per acre; 73 sales by
the-Santa Fe Railroad of l3,630.0T acres in the reservation at an
average price of $6.37 per acre; and, 37 sales by the Union Pacific
and Kansas Pacific Railroads, totaling'8H,633.75 acres, sold at an
average price of $1.97 per acre. These sales show there was a ready
market for lands in the reservation area for some time prior to 1868
and thereafter, and the prices at which such land was selling. However, we think the record indicates that a large number of the M,7lO
sales classified as unimproved land were actually improved. Many of

the deeds recite considerations running from $15.00 to $25.00 and

more per acre, and at least some of the land was probably acquired

by the grantors by either homestead or preemption entries which would
require improvements. While we have considered the evidence of these
sales, it is recognized that such evidence cannot be of great value
because of the “guesswork” necessary in the determination of the
extent to which the improvements would contribute to the values.
With.respect to the sales of the reservation surplus land itself,

it is undisputed that it was all unimproved land at the time of the

re-sale in small tracts by the Santa Fe. The Santa Fe commenced the
sale of said lands in 1869 and the last deed was issued in 1901.

Claimants‘ Exhibit No. 15-B-2 includes a list of the contracts
of sale of the Surplus land made by the Santa Fe in the years l869
through 1871+, and also a list of the deeds issued by it from 1370 to
1901 covering substantially all the lands and the consideration paid
therefor. .According to the list, during the first siz:years the Santa
re made _1833 contracts for the sale of 237,145; acres of surplus land,
averaging 130 acres per contract. The aggregate sales price shown
was $l,H39,00U.l5, or an_average price of $6.06 per acre, with the
average cash down payment of $1.38 per acre and the balance on credit
terms. However, 38% contracts were surrendered during the first three
years reducing the total sales price to $1,123,819.35. In this cone
nection, it appears from the evidence that in 187% the Santa Fe still.
had 83,000 acres remaining unsold and in 1876 the unsold acreage had
increased to some 96,000 acres. This was due apparently to the surrendered contracts. _The deeds listed show that between the years
1870 and 1901, inclusive, the Santa Fe issued 1538 deeds covering a.
total of 338,821.90 acres of the surplus lands in the four counties
‘for a total consideration of $l,h92,6l2.39, or an average of $h.Hl
per acre. The average acreage covered by each deed was 220 acres .

It is to be noted, however, that the deeds issued between 1870
and 1887, inclusive, covered nearly all of the land, or 336,7%2.93

.acres, while the deeds from 1888 to 1901 covered only l,578.97 acres.

in listing the deeds in Exhibit 15-B-2 issued by the Santa Fe, three
were inadvertently listed twice because they covered adjoining lands
in two counties, and were recorded in each county, thus reducing-the
deeds issued to 1535. He further testified that three purchasers,

C. Wu Pierce, George Opdyke, and D. L. Lakin, were also directors of
the Santa Fe Railroad, and that the average consideration paid by each
of them for lands purchased was considerably below the average per
acre price received by the Santa Fe from other purchasers. Claimants
contend that if the three duplicate sales and the sales to the three
purchasers who were directors, were all eliminated "as not being arms
length transactions”, the average per acre price received by the Santa
Fe for the surplus land would be increased from $H.#l to $3.99. We
find it difficult to follow these computations made by claimants.
While it is true the three men named were directors at different times
of the Santa.Fe Railroad, he do not find any evidence in the record of
fraud in connection with the purchases made by them from the Santa Fe.
In fact, the record discloses that a considerable number of sales were
made to these men at a per acre price in excess of the $M.Ml average
per acre price.

It is a well established fact that a sale of a large tract of
land as a unit brings far less than when sold in small tracts. .A
prospective purchaser in 1868 would have to take into consideration

the risk involved as to the future economic conditions of the country,

and whether there would be a continuing«demand for land in the area.

He would also consider the.1ength of time it would take to dispose of
all the land, and the costs of sale, so that in the end he would
realize a profit. .As we have stated above, the Santa Fe sold the surplus land in small tracts over the period from 1868 to 1901, and under
the methods of sale adopted by the company, partly for cash and on
terms, it brought an average per acre price of $h.hl.

From the record as a whole, we conclude that the surplus lands
sold to the Santa Fe Railroad Company had an average fair market
value of $2.00 per acre on dugust 7, 1868, taking into consideration
the demand for the land, the evidence of the subsequent sales of the
land by the Santa Fe and other sales of land in the area during the
period just prior to 1868 and shortly thereafter.

with respect to claimants‘ right to recover on the ground that
the Pottawatomie Tribe was paid an unconscionable consideration for
the surplus lands, we have grave doubts as to whether the disparity
between the amount the Tribe received and the fair value of the surplus land at the time of sale was unconscionable, within the meaning
of the Indian Claims commission Act, so we will consider the other
ground of fair and honorable dealings in connection with what we have
said above.

The claimants seem to make no distinction between the breach of
fiduciary duties the Government owed the Pottawatomie Tribe and its
failure to deal fairly and honorably with it as a ground for recovery.
Whether there is a legalistic distinction between the two duties, or.
uhether one is included in the other as a ground of recovery, we shall

not stop to discuss because, we believe, that under the circumstances

as -—n 4—.pwq_-,t%,—¢_ __..q . ..,.... ...-— —-— ....-...- .--ac.--.-_ -..-u.-_u.--of this case, the Government did not fulfill its fiduciary duties to
the Pottawatomie Tribe and did not deal fairly in inducing said tribe
to sell its surplus lands to the Santa Fe Railroad at a price of onehalf 1 ts value .

The record clearly shows that the Pottawatomie surplus land was

.well located close to rapidly building settlements, and it was these

very qualities that made it so attractive to settlers whom Kansas
wanted and needed. .A railroad had actually been constructed through
the Reserve, and another, the Santa Fe, was being constructed so near
as to have a direct value on land.values. The Government representatives must be presumed to have known of railroad construction, both
completed and contemplated, and its effect on the economy of the
country and bearing on land values. Yet these factors seem not to
have been considered in fixing the amount the Santa Eu was to pay,

at least they do not seem reflected in the purchase price.

When we consider what actually happened in consummating the
sale under the 1861 treaty and compare it with the sale made in
1868, we are confronted with a change of position entirely detrimental to the interests of the Pottawatomies. Here are the undeniable

facts:

By the 1861 treaty the sale price of the surplus lands was $1.25
per acre in "gold or silver coin", this at a time when we were engaged
in the Civil War and the economy of the country upset by the war effort.
Following this relatively high.price payable in coin, the Government

induced the sale in 1868 at $1.00 per acre payable in lawful money

(which is considered as meaning depreciated paper currency) the actual
price received for the land under the 186? treaty was but little more
than sixty hents per acre as paper currency had depreciated about

35 cents on the par value of the dollar. It can hardly be expected
that the Pottawatomies would be able to understand the pecuniary
effects of permitting payment in lawful money, that is, paper money
that had depreciated to the extent indicated. Certainly the Indians,
because of their ignorance of our language and inexperience in finané
cial matters, would and had the right to rely upon the Government to
advise and protect them in their dealings. This, we believe, the

Government did not do and as a result of their failure the Indians

were permitted to make a sale of their surplus lands to the Santa

Fe at a price far below the value on August 7, 186$.

In this connection we point out that there are no records of
the negotiations between the Pottamatomie delegation and the representatives of the Government, although they took place in Washington,
D. c., relating to the amendment to the 1867 treaty providing for
the sale of the surplus lands to the Santa Fe, but it seems Senator
Pomeroy, a.United states Senator for Kansas, who later became an official of the Santa Fe Railroad, sponsored the amendment in the Senate,
and may possibly have conducted the negotiations with the Pottawatomie
delegates. Moreover, the commissioner of Indian Affairs stated the
amendment had not.been transmitted to the Senate through his office,

leaving the inference that he did not approve the transaction.

But, the Government maintains the, sale was made at the urging
of the Pottawatomies themselves. There is strong and convincing
evidence to support this contention for it is shown that when the
Union Pacific Railroad, on September l6, 18.67, declined to purchase
the surplus lands under the l86l treaty, the Government made plans
to appraise the surplus lands and sell them at auction to the highest bidder for cash in 160 acre tracts and at not less than $1.25
per acre, as it was required to do under Article 6 of that treaty.
This the Indians did not want done because they feared it would take
too long and that they would derive but little by such method of
handling their lands. What they wanted was for the Government to
purchase all their surplus landslat $1.25 per acre or sell them to_
some other responsible parties at the same price and vritho as little
delay as possible.

The G-overnmentacceded to the desire of the Indians for a sale
in bulk, a delegation of Pottawatomie Indians was sent to Washington
and the 1867 treaty, which had been concluded on February 27, 1867,
but not ratified, was amended by providing for the sale to the Santa
Fe’. The treaty as amended, was ratified on July 25, 1868, and pro- P

claimed by the President on August 7, l868. The fact that the Pottewatomies desired and agreed to a sale in bulk of their surplus lands
did not, however, relieve the Government of its duty to deal fairly

and honorably with or on behalf of the Indians in permitting a sale

at the price stated in the 1867 treaty.

Therefore, under the facts and circumstances of this case, as
disclosed by the entire record, we conclude that the Pottawatomie
Tribe should recover the difference between the $1.00 per acre it
received for the surplus land on august 7, 1868 and its fair market
value of $2.00 per acre on that date. We have found that a total
of 338,795.22 acres of land was sold to the Santa Fe, so the Pottawatomie Tribe is entitled to recover an award in the sum of
$333,795-22.

2. The “Depreciated Lawful Money“ Claim
This claim is for the recovery of the amount of the loss alleged

to have been sustained by the Pottawatomie Tribe of Indians as a
result of the.sale, under the provisions of the treaty of February 27,
1867, of the 338,766.82 acres of the Tribe's hansas surplus lands

for $1.00 per acre paid for in alleged depreciated "lawful money"
rather than in gold or silver coin. It is alleged that the approval
of such sale by the defendant for the price paid was a violation of
its fiduciary obligations to the Tribe, and it should now pay the
émauht of the alleged loss, which is fixed at different amounts in
the two cases.

We are of the opinion that claimants are not entitled to recover on this claim. It has not been shown where there was any
fiduciary or contractual duty on the part of the Government to require payment to be made for the surplus lands in gold or silver coin.
Moreover, at the time these lands were sold under the 1867 treaty,

there was in effect the.Act of Congress of February 25, 1862, 12 Stat.

and private, to be made in “lawful money" of the United States.

In any event, since the Pottawatomie Tribe has now been granted a
recovery by the Commission for the fair market value of the surplus
lands, as of August 7, 1868, the date sold, on the basis of present
day money, and as the deduction for the purchase price that was paid

is on the same basis, the Tribe is not entitled to any additional

recovery on this claim.
§. The Railroad Eight of Way Claim '

This is a claim for Just compensation for a strip of the Pottewatomie Tribeis Kansas reservation land, #00 feet wide and 32.109
miles long, alleged to have been taken or appropriated‘by the defendant, by the Act of Congress of July 1, 1862 (l2 Stat. U89), without
the consent of the Pottawatomie Tribe or payment of any compensation.
The claimants maintain this right of way strip contained 1556.80
acres of land worth $10.00 per acre on.July l, 1862, and ask judgment for $15,558.00 with interest thereon from that date, or a total
of about $82,821.76. 0

The defendant admits in its proposed findings of fact and brief
that said land was taken as al1eged,aand the liability of the defendant to the Pottamatomie Tribe on this claim, but contends the acreage
so taken was 11+5u.65 acres and had a value of not to exceed $1.50 per
acre on July 1,1862.

The following are the alleged and admitted facts pertinent to

this claim. The Pottawatomie Reservation in Kansas, comprising some

576,000 acres, was purchased by the Pottawatomie Tribe from the defendant under the terms of the l8H6 treaty. By the Act of July 1, 1862,
the United States granted to the Leavenworth, Pawnee and Western
Railroad Company a right of way across the lands of the Pottaeatomie
Reservation from east to west #00 feet wide, without obtaining the

consent of the Pottawatomie Tribe or payment of any compensation
therefor to said Tribe. This grant was accepted on November 1M, 1862,
by the Union Pacific Railway Company, Eastern Division, successor to
the Ieavenworth, Pawnee and Western Railroad Company, and during
1865 and 1866 said Railway Company constructed a railroad over such
right of way from east to west through the Pottawatomie Reservation.

It appears that under the provisions of the treaty‘of November 15,
1861, supra, between the United States and the Pottawatomie Tribe,
this same Railroad Company, upon certain conditions not material
here, had been offered a 100 foot wide right of way through the
Pottanatomie Reservation, but such offer was never accepted and it
has been judicially determined that the railroad was not constructed
as provided by that treaty, but under the grant made by the Act of

July 1, 1862. N_a_d.eau vs. The Union Pacific Railroad Company, 253 0.5.

It is claimants‘ contention that the Pottawatomie Tribe is entitled
to compensation under the Fifth.Amendment to the Constitution.

It having been established by the evidence, and admitted by ‘
defendant, that there was an involuntary‘uncompensated taking by
‘defendant of the Pottawatomie Reserve lands contained in the M00 foot
right of way, we are of the opinion that the Pottawatomie Tribe is
therefore entitled, as a matter of law, to recover just compensation
from the defendant for the lands so taken. Shoshone Tribe vs. United
States, 299 U. S. 276; United States vs. Creek Nation, 295, U. S. lO3.

As to the date of taking of this land by the defendant, the
parties are in agreement that the land was taken on July l, l862.

There remains the questions of the amount of land taken, and

its value on July 1, 1862.

,As to the acreage of Reserve land taken for the right of way,

the only evidence offered on this question is a letter of July 1%,
1952, from the Union Pacific Railroad company, addressed to counsel
for the Prairie Band in answer to his prior letter of July llth
(Claimants' Ex. 23 in 15-3) which states in part as follows:

5The length of the Kansas-Denver main line through this

reservation.is 32.109 miles, and the right of way inr

eluding some additional station grounds within the reservation is l#54.65 acres.“

While claimants contend that mathematically a right of way #00 feet
wide and 32.109 miles long contains 1556.80 acres, we believe the  

acreage reported by the Union Pacific is correct, and we conclude

P that 1M5h.65 acres of the Reserve were taken by the defendant.

ye have the problem of determining the value of the lh5h.65
acres as of the date of the taking, July 1, 1862. The tract has not
been classified on an acreage basis either as to the amount subject
to cultivation or as to soil types, but from an examination of a
soils map it appears that while there is some upland, the tract as
a whole is about evenly divided between bottom land, subject to the
drawbacks and inconveniences of overflow, and second bottom land of
excellent productivity. 0

claimants have platted on a soil map those of the R710 abstracted deeds which are dated in 1867, 1868 and 1869, and report

that 3l2 of them conveyed bottom land, averaged 93.87 acres per sale
and brought an average of $8.23 per acre. Upon this and the testimony of their expert witness, Mr. Davis, that good bottom land was
worth $10.00 and overflow bottom land $7.00 per acre in 1868, we
are asked to fi::a fair amrket value of $10.00 per acre as of
July l, lé62,‘upon the land appropriated for right of way purposes.
It is not the variation in size of the tracts which concerns
‘us so much as the fact, as we have heretofore stated, that the
R710 deeds cannot be said to convey solely unimproved land, and
the fact that the 312 transactions relied on.by claimants occurred
five, six and seven years after the appropriation date, when.no
similarity existed as to general conditions of the country, In
1862 Kansas had just entered the'Union and was emerging from a low
economic period, rainfall was subnormal, transportation poor. By

1868 there had been a period of rapid growth and expansion within

the state, economic conditions and prices generally had improved due
to the prosecution of the Civil War, rainfall'was better, there were

military roads throughout the country and railroads operated in the

area. All this would materially enhance land values, and we note that

in l862 the arithmetic mean of all reported sales within the four
counties of Jackson, Wabaunsee, Pottawatomie and Shawnee, but outside the Pottawatomie Reservation, was but $2.88 per acre. (clmntls
Ex. 15-B-2). Admittedly land values were low.
The record contains evidence of other sales more comparable

in time to the appropriation date. 78,602.16 acres of Iowa Indian
land lying in the bend of the Missouri river in extreme northeastern
Kansas was sold in small tracts under the public land laws for an
average of $2.3M per acre between March H, 1857, and November 30,
1860. Delaware Indian land adjoining the Pottawatomie Reservation
to the east sold at public auction between July, 1867 and November 30,
1860, for $1.68 per acre, following appraisals of from $1.25 to $2.00
per acre. Surplus Delaware land lying 12 miles east of the Pottauatomie Reservation was appraised February 21, 1861, by the quarter
section.at from 80 cents per acre to $1.50 per acre, an average of
$1.28. Under the treaty of my 2, 1861, 12 Stat. 1177, the Delawares agreed to the sale of 223,966.78 acres of this land at its
appraisednvalue of $1.28 per acre, on credit terms of 10 years with

6 percent interest. There was, however, less bottom land than.upland involved in this transaction.

In recognition of its productive capacity as compared with the
balance of the Pottawatomie Reservation, its location in the path
of westward expansion and the prices at which other lands were being
appraised and sold, we conclude that on July 1, 1862, the 1,u5u.55
acres of land appropriated by the defendant had.an.average fair market
value of $3.00 per acre.

As the Pottawatomie Tribe is entitled to just compensation, it
is entitled to the value of the land on July 1, 1862, plus an additional amount measured by interest to make just compensation.
Accordingly we find 5 percent to be a reasonable rate from July 1,
1862, to hovember 9, 1935, and.U percent a reasonable rate thereafter. The Pottawatomie Tribe is therefore entitled to recover an
award for the fair market value of the l,h5h.65 acres on July 1,
1862, or $3,363.95, and interest thereon at 5 percent from July l,
1862, to November 9, l93H, and # percent thereafter.

' h. The "Submerged Land“ Claim

 

The next claim of the Pottawatomie Tribe is for the recovery
of the value of some h638.37 acres of land alleged to be unaccounted
for by the defendant in the disposition or the Pottawatomie Kansas
Reservation under the 1861 and 1367 treaties. It is alleged the total
number of acres in the 30 mile square reservation was 576,000 and
that the defendant has failed to account for some h638.37 acres.
The defendant maintains it has made a complete accounting of all the
576,000 acres, except for an unexplained shortage of h09.58 acres,

for which.it admits liability to the Pottawatomie Tribe.

It is true, of course, the United States agreed in the 1845
treaty to grant the Pottauatomie Tribe a tract 30 miles square
containing 576,000 acres, but it should be pointed out that the
treaty also recited that the lands of the Reserve were located on
“both sides of the Kansas River". We believe it is quite apparent
from the evidence that when the United States caused the Reservation
to be surveyed in October of 1862 for the purpose of alloting the
lands and setting aside the diminished Reserve as provided by the
terms of the 1861 treaty, that some h200.M9 acres were shown to be
submerged in the bed of the Kansas river which flowed through the
Reservation. This submerged land, of course, was unsalable, and it
is difficult to see hoe the Government can now be charged with a
failure to account for lands it could not possibly sell.

In the case of the Cherokee Nation v. United States, 102 Ct.
Clms. 7g0, a similar issue to the one here was raised. In that case
the Indians sought to hold the United States accountable for unsalable lands in a tract "twelve miles square" they had ceded to
the United States to be sold by it for their benefit. After the land
had been surveyed'and sold the Indians claimed the acreage sold and
accounted for was only 89,111.93 acres whereas a tract twelve miles

square would contain 92,160 acres. In denying relief the court said

in its opinion at page 757;

“But the tract was not a perfect square, since, as
described in the cession, it was bounded on one side
by the Tennessee River. Besides, two tributaries of
the river flowed through the tract and made unsalable
some of the acreage. We do not know how many acres of
salable land the tract contained, hence, we do not find

that the United States has accounted for less acreage
than was conveyed to it."

5. The Grant of 6hO Acres of Reserve Lands to Two Missions

. This claim is for the recovery of the value of two tracts of the

Pottawatomie Reserve lands of 320 acres each granted to each of the
missions located on the reservation.

This land mas first set aside under Article 6 of the treaty of
November 15, 1861, which provided that the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs should select 320 acres of Reserve land, to include the

church and school houses of the St. Mary's catholic Mission, which

;_s§ the Secretary of the Interior was to convey to the Board of Trustees

tail of the mission, on condition.that so long as the Pottawatomie Nation

occupied any portion of the reservation, the land was to be used
exclusively to maintian a school and church for its benefit.
There was also to be se1ected.and conveyed in.1ike manner, and uyon
the same conditions, 320 acres of reserve land to include the Baptist
Mission buildings, such conveyance to be made to such.persons as
the Baptist Board of‘Hissions should designate.

Thereafter,.Article 11 of the 1867 treaty provided that the
320 acres previously set apart for the St. Mary's Mission be granted

in.fee-simple to John F. Deils, John Shoemaker and M. Gilland

. - og-an _-:1 -..p-::--.-na-q..¢--u—u———u—|-I——Ii, —_ .--. -.I- - -._..-.-.-q-‘..—- my-u-cu-—u---urn-—-I-_— ‘ - *_‘

(the same men named as trustees in the 1861 treaty), and that the
320 acres of the Baptist Mission be granted in fee-simple to such
party as the Baptist Board of Missions designated.

The evidence shows that the two missions were established on
the reservation during 1838 and l8M9. The St. Mary's Mission
operated continuously, and while the Baptist Mission was not quite
so successful, it functioned without interruption except for at
brief period during the Civil War, and both were operating on the
reservation when the 1867 treaty was negotiated. That the missions
served the Pottawatomies well over the years is shown by the reports of Indian.Agents in Kansas during the period, and this is
conceded by the Prairie gand,

Claimants maintain, however, the grants of this land to the
missions were gifts that were unjustified. They further insist
it was known that the members of the citizen Band were moving shortly
after the 1868 treaty to the Indian country, and the missions would
not serve them in their new home.

Nothing has been presented to show that the defendant was not
acting in the interests of the Indians when it approved such grants
to the missions. The Pottawatomie Indians had derived full benefits
from the schools and churches established on their reservation and
it was important to those Indians remaining in Kansas that the
schools continue in operation. While it is true some of the members
of the Citizen Band were to move south after 1868, yet the Prairie

Band and many of the members of the citizen Band remained in Kansas

and still live there. In this connection it is noted that the Citizen
Band did not assert this claim before the commission, instead it was
presented by the Prairie Band of Indians who presumably would be benefited by the continued operations of the missions. It is altogether
conceivable.that it was the Pottawatomies themselves that might have
requested the approval of their grants by the Government in appreciation of past services and the assurance the schools and churches
would continue in operation. Certainly the grants were for the benefit of the Pottawatomies and not the defendant. The claimants are not
entitled to recover on this claim.
6. The sale of lOl3.§h Acres of §urplus Land to Three Individuals

This last claim is for recovery of additional compensation for
l0l3.5M acres of the Pottawatomie Reserve land sold to John F. Deilsp
John Shoemaker and M. Gillaud at $1.00 per acre, as provided in the
second paragraph of Article ll of the treaty of 1867. Claimants contend that defendant induced the Pottawatomiestbwagree to the sale
of this land to the three individuals, and that the consideration
received by the Pottawatomie Tribe was unconscionable to the same
extent and for the same reasons that the sale to the Santa.Fe Bail-O
road at $1.00 an acre was unconscionable.

The only apparent difference between this sale and the sale of
the balance of the surplus land to the Santa Fe is that the three
individuals were granted a preference over the Santa Fe in selecting

the land they desired to purchase. These three individuals had been

‘named as the trustees for the St. Mary's Catholic Mission land set

apart under the 1861 treaty and were the grantees of that land under
Article 11 of the 1867 treaty, so we can assume it was a result of
their close association with the Pottawatomies at the Catholic Mission
that they were granted the privilege of buying this land at the same
price as the Santa re Railroad. It is also quite possible, although
not shown by the evidence, that the land was to be used in connection
with the operation of the St. Mary's Mission on the reservation.
Nevertheless, these three individual purchasers were required by the
1867 treaty to pay for this land at the same rate per acre as the
Santa Fe was required to pay for the balance of the surplus land,
and we are of the opinion there was no more justification for permitting the sale of the lOl3.5h acres of land at $l.OO~per acre
when it was worth twice that much, than in the sale to the Santa Fe
Eailroad. Accordingly, we conclude this sale must be considered on
the same basis as the sale to the Santa Fe, and for the same reasons
as heretofore set forth in connection with the Santa Fe sale, the
claimants are entitled to recover on behalf of the Pottawatomie Tribe
the additional sum of $1.00 per acre for the lOl3.5h acres of surplus land, a total of $1o13.5l;.

Finally, it should be stated.that the Government derived no

benefits from any of the transactions for which awards have been

made in this case.
To summarize, we conclude, that the Pottawatomie Tribe is enr
titled to recover (l) on the first claim the sum.of $338,795.22

for the surplus land; and (2) on the third claim for the railroad
