.The Commission makes the following finding of fact which is supplennntal to the findings numbered 1 through 1? heretofore made herein.
gi8.. The Commission finds that the Nevada portion of the lands

aboriginally possessed by the Washoe Indians (as described in Finding
No. 16, as amended) was taken by the United States, without payment of
connensation on December 31, ISS2. In l8S§’theIndian Agent in Carson
Valley and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs (Pet. Ex. 3-72 and 3-73)
began to plan the removal oflndiansto reservations from abont Carson
Valley and the main east-west route of travel. ‘Two tracts; one in the
va1ier'of the Truckee at Pyranid Lake and the second on Walker River
and Walker lake were selected by the Indian.Agent in Carson Valley for
reservations for the Indians nearby; including the'Washoe Indians. The
Commissioner of Indian Affairs recommended to the Secretary of the
Interior that these tracts be set aside for Indian purposes. In June

1860 the Indian Agent at Pyramid Lake referred to that area as the

“Pah-Ute” and uga—Sho” Indian reser"ation. By December 31, 1862 these
two tracts had come into operation as Indian reservations; but were
occupied only by Northern Paiute Indians. No Washoe Indians ever
settled upon either of these teo reservations although they were

established and intended to be for the Northern Paints and Washoe
Indians (Pet. Exhibits 3-97, 3-100, 3-127). Doctor Omar 0. Stewart,
witness for the plaintiff, testified that by the year 1863 the Washoe

Indians had lost all their lands (Tr. pp. 1h?~1h9).
