The case was submitted to the Commission upon the motion of the
defendant for a summary judgment in defendant‘s favor, dismissing the
action "on the ground that there is no genuine issue as to any mterinl
fact and that the defendant is entitled to a Judgment as a matter of law
in that the issues contained in the petition have been heretofore jaw
dicially determinei and the matter is res judicete by reason of the former

‘Nation V. The'United States, 91 Ct. Cls. 320.5 (No, K~260 in that Court.)
The motion was made pursuant to Sec. l1(b) of the Commission's Rules of
Procedure.

Accompanying said.motion an affidavit,was filed marked Exhibit=A,
‘Upon a hearing of said motiong the defendant introduced in evidence the
original petition (Def'e. Ex. No. 1); a first amended petition (De£'s,
31: N0» 2); a second amended original petition (Defis. Exp No. 3)-all
filed in the case of The Choctao Nation v. The‘United Statesg 31 Ct. Cls.
Qgg; also the special findings of fact and the opinion of the Court of
Claims, as reported in said case (Def‘s. Ex. No. M).

The motion was orally argued before the Commission and was taken
under advisement.

The right of the defendant to interpose the defense of res judicata

under the terms of the act creating the Commission and fixing its Jurisdiction has been upheld by this Commission in its opinions in its

Docket No. 2, The Western (Old settler) and Eastern (Emigrant) Cherokee.)
Indians; No. 3, The western or Old settler Group of Cherokee Indians;
331 D°Ck9%‘N0o 5, The Eastern (Emigrant) Cherokee Indians, and that

right confirmed by opinions rendered by the Court of Claims upon appeals

in the aforesaid cases.

of Claims shows that the parties were the same in both cases; and that

time the fund was diminished by disbursements thereof, and interest at

the fund was exhausted; the plaintiffs further. stated that the interest

derived from this 3% fund amounted to $95,13u.66, whereas had this_fund

is entitled to judgment." (Par. x, p. 26, Plaintiff's seeona.emeeeee
Petition, 'De£'s. k. No. 3). The plaintiffs also filed a claim for

interest at 533 per annum allegedly due under the "Choctaw Three For

JU

Cent fund” and stated that said interes was claimed on the disburse-—
ments from the close of the fiscal year in which made to June 30, 1935,
in the amount of $37i,u31.96 (Par, 1r(d), p. 26, Plaintiffis Second
Amended Petition, Def‘s. 3. Nos 3).;

In the instant case the petitioner alleges, as was alleged in case
Noe K-250 in the Court of Claims, the provisions of the treaty of June 22,,
1855 by the Choctaw 1-Tation and the United States creating a trust iund

is the see of $500,000 which.was to bear interest at 5% per annum and

that said interest was for a.period_paid at the rate of 3% per annum by

of 5% instead of 3% there would have been due the petitioner as earned
interest on said trust fund as of June 30, 1935, the total additional
sum of a$63,h23.11 (pleansu-its pet,’ pars. 1; and 5). Petitioner further
pleads "that the reduction in the rate of interest from 5% to 3% constituted a breach of defendantis treats obligations and was made without
petitioner's consent, by reason whereof petitioner is justly entitled
to recover the sum of $63,h23§ll, with interest at h§ per annum from
f*June 30, 1935.“ (Plaintiff's pets, par. 6).'V

Petitioner further seeks interest on $63.h23.l1 computed from the
several dates when annual interest payments comprising said sum became
due and were unpaid (Plaintiff's pet., par, 7).

The claim in the instant case is shown to be the exact claim as
mess in re. X-260 in the Court of Claims.

Said case ‘No. K--260 was decided on april 1, 1940 (91 ct. Cls. 320)
and the Court of Claims found and determined that the Choctaw Nation
was entitled to judgment in the amount of $63,323.11, the exact amount
which the plaintiffs sought to recover in that case and the exact amount
sought in the instant case; but the Court held that offsets authorized

by the statute of August 12, 1935 (19 Stat." 51/1; 596), and conceded ‘by

the plaintiff therein to be proper in the amount of $63,h50¢25 (if the
Court should hold the offset statute constitutional——which it did), more
than equaled the amount of the award to which plaintiff was entitled and

therefore the petition of the plaintiff should be and was dismissed (91

see Cleo 320, et a1,, Defis. Ex. no, M).

It wasifurther held by said Court of Claims in said opinion that
interest on the $63,E23.ll was not recoverable as such or as damages
‘under section 177 of the Judicial Code, and also because the provisions
of Article 13 oi‘ the treaty of 1855 (11 stat, 611) did not require that
interest should become a part of the trust fund,

.A petition by the plaintiff in cause No. K-260 for a writ of

ocertiorari in the Court of Claims was denied by the Supreme Court of

the United States on Ielarch 3, 19141 (312 ms. 695).,
In response to the motion for summary judgment petitioner pleaded
that the statement of facts as contained in the notion of defendant "is
substantially correct“ and, further, that "the Court of Claims specifically found that as a matter of law the plaintiff was entitled to recover
the difference in interest from the trust fund when paid at 3% rather
than at 5%” (in amount $53,M23.l1)¢ The plaintiff offered no evidence,
Petitioner contends, however, that the Court of Claims “concluded
that the defendant was entitled to offset against the claim of the plaintiff
gratuity disbursements in the son of $3¢5?4,439o659" and that "such method

of offsetting valid claims is not proper, correct, nor validg" In support

of its legal contention petitioner cites the cones of the Seminole Nation

 

v,'United States, reported in 3l6'U.S. 256 and 310.

Based on such contention the petitioner asserts the right to re, 1iti6%§§p§h9_9¥oqt olain litigated and_decided_in.the.Court of Claims:

tin case No. K9260} reported in 91 Ct. C18. 320.

This Commission is of the opinion that the previous decision is res

' gudicata and that petitioner's contentions cannot be sustained.

The Commission is of the opinion that if the Court of Claims hadi
offset the sum of $3,57M.h39.55 against the claim of petitioner as petitioner claims, that nevertheless such action, if error, would not prevent the said decision from being res judicata of the instant case for

 

nuthe reason that petitioner had opportunity in that proceeding to urge

the same contentions that it urges here as to the proper determination
of offsets, and had such opportunity in the Supreme Court, which denied
certiorari in said case.

However, the Court of Claims in its opinion in case No. K~26O sets
out specific items of expenditure onion the opinion says the plaintiff
therein concedes as proper offsets in the following amounts (Def's. Ex.
No. U), to wit:

In finding 31 of fact, items constituting $l6,h88.6O are identified
as constituting allowable offsets (p. 25); likewise, finding 32, $5,998.82
is identified (p. 25); finding 33, $31,076.22 is identified (p. 26); finding 35, $s,71o,52 is identified (pg 23); finding 35, $572.96 is

In petitioner‘s response to motion for summary judgment it is
alleged that “the permission to claim gratuities as authorized in the
said act of august l2, 1935 is denied the defendant" by the act creating
the Indian Claims Commission and, further, that “the defense that was
available to the United States in E-260 * 5 * has now been taken away

from it, with the result that the concededly valid claim of the plaintiff

C etands'unsatis£ied and not offset and the privilege of offsetting it is

Ehat case (K9260) was tried at a time when the gratuities mentioned
were allowable offsets by the Government and they were so used to liqui—l
date the claim, we find nothing in the Indian Claims Commission Act
which permits a neconsideration of the offsets on the basis of the
present act, The judgment of the Court of Claims wiped out the claim

and the Indian Claims Commission has no power to reconsider its
