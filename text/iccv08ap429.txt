OPIKI N O? TEE CCHHISSIGH

 _

‘Watkins, Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.

The matters now before the Commission are a proposed compromise
settlement of offsets and the award of attorneys‘ fees,
Prior to this time, the Commission has handed down two decisions
on the merits of the claim asserted in this docket. The first was made
on February 29, l9S6 with Findings of Fact and Opinion (h Ind. Cl. Comm.
151) and an Interlocutory Order which provided that the defendant was
liable to each of the petitioners for the value of the land as of July 2,
1872, which it nsed and occupied as of that date, as described in certain
Findings, less the parts thereof lying within the boundaries of the
Colville Reservation. ‘The tribes and Findings referred to are as f0llGJS:
San Poil and Nespelem Tribes, Finding 15
Colville Tribe, Finding 23
Lake Tribe, Finding 26 '
Okanogan Tribe, Finding 37
Methow Tribe, Finding no.
The Commission found that the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation is an organization recognized by the Secretary of the Interior
as having authority to represent the Indians enrolled on the Colville
.Reservation, being approximately 3,650 Indians, of which approximately
2,790 are members of the six petitioner tribes; that each of the six
petitioner tribes is a tribe, band, and identifiable group of.American
Indians residing in the United States; and that each of the individual

petitioners was, at the time of filing the petition in this case, a mem_

ber of the tribe which he sohght to represent.

Subsequent groeeegincs to determine the value of the five separate
tracts as of July 2: 1872 resulted in a second decision made on March 5,
1959. Pursuant to Additional Findings of Fact and Opinion (7 Ind. C1.

Comm. 187), the Commission made and entered a Second Interlocutory Order

providing that the descendants of the tribes of the Colville Reservation

named below shall recover from the defendant the following sums:
Colville Tribe, $l11,000.00
Sanpoil~Nespelem Tribe, $536,000.00
Okanogan Tribe, $237,000.00
Methow Tribe, $152,000.00
Lake Tribe, $l2§9000.00
and that from each of said suns shall be deducted such offsets as the
Commission shall determine the defendant is entitled at a later hearing.
"We are now asked to approve a proposed compromise settlement of

offsets, as rd attorneys‘ fees and enter final judgment herein.

C HFROMISE SETTLEMZET OF OFFSETS

 

This comes on by Joint Motion for Entry of Final Judgment made by
the petitioners and the defendant and filed with the Commission on January
19, 1960. It is based on a Stipulation for Entiy of Final Judgment filed
on the same day, which is set forth in full in the Findings. In addition,
the petitioners filed on January 21, 1960 a Petition for Approval of
Settlement of Offsets and Entry of Final Judgment.

By their stipulation and motion, the parties propose that there be
set off,against the 7nterlocutory judgment of March-S, 1959, offsets in
the aggregate sun of $515000, to be allocated so as to make a final

judgment as follows:

8 Ind. Cl. Com.
532

Colville Tribe, $111,000.00 less the offset of
$6,b00.00, that is, the net sum of $l0h,600.00;

San Poil-Hespelem Tribe, $h36,000.00 less the offset
of $25,100.00, that is, the net sum of $hl0,900.00;

Okanogan Tribe, $237,000.00 less the offset of
T $13,600.00, that is, the net sum of $223,hO0.00;

Hethow Tribe, $152,000.00 less the offset of $8,700.00,
that is, the net sum of $lh3,300.00;

Lake Tribe, $125,000.00, less the offset of $7,200.00,
that is, the net sum of $ll?,800.00.

The procedure to be followed in cases of settlement, which has
recently been set out by the Commission in our Opinion of February ll,
1960 in Docket No. 225 Consolidated, the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska, et al.,
petitioners, has been followed in the instant case. A hearing has been
held, and oral and documentary evidence received in support of the
compromise, as outlined in our Findings of Fact herein. Harvey Moses,
Chairman of the Colville Business Council, and Nellie Rima, Secretary,
testified for the petitioners. we are satisfied that the proposed settlement of offsets has been carefully and fully presented to the Indians
who are petitioners herein, that_it has been widely discussed and conm
sidered by said.Indians, that it is understood by them, and that they
have consented to and approved the same both formally through resolutions
unanimously adopted at a general tribal meeting and by the Colville
Business Council, and by their general consent and lack of opposition
thereto.‘

The stipulation of settlement has been signed and approved by all

surviving individual petitioners. There were originally two individual

8 Ind. 31, Con, nan , 433

each of the six named tribes. In only one case,
gen tribe are both of the petitioners now deceased, A
son of each of the deceased persons has signed the stipulation, This

ordinarily would not be sufficient and a substitution of petitioners

,would be necessary, However, we will not require such a substitution

of petitioners in the instant case because the Okanogan Tribe is also
represented by the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation.

As to the reasonableness of the amount of the compromise, we have
the assurance of counsel for both the petitioners and defendant that they
have examined, analyzed and weighed statements and information from the
General.Accounting Office showing disbursements by the United States for
the Indians of the Colville Reservation between July, l8?2 and June 30,
1957 in the total amount of $2,39h,8?b,00, ‘While the compromise sum of
$61,000.00 appears small when compared to this total, counsel for the
parties have reached the conclusion, and it is likewise our opinion,
that in View of the applicable and pertinent Statutes of the United
States and decisions of this Commission and the United States Court of

Claims, a settlement of offsets at the $6l,000,00 figure is fair, reasonu

able and just. The allocation between the tribes is also fair and proper.‘

Offsets will therefore be allowed in the um of $61,000.00 to be

allocated as follows:

Colville Tribe, $6 b0
San Foil-Nespelem
Okanogan Tribe, $1
Methow Tribe, 3,? ,
Lake Tribe, $7,200.00.

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 520 435
Final judgment will be entered in the following net amounts:

Colville Tribe, $l0h,600.00

San Poil-Nespelem Tribe, $hl0,900.00

Okanogan Tribe, $223,h00.00

Methow Tribe, $lh3,300.00

Lake Tribe, $ll7,800.00.

ATTORNEYS‘ FEES
A Petition of Attorney of Record for Award of Attorneys’ Fees, by
I. S.'Weissbrodt, attorney of record for the petitioners, was filed with
the Commission on January 21, 1960, together with a Statement in Support
,of Petition for Award of Attorneys’ Fees.
A copy of the Attorneys‘ Contract, with amendments, with the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, as approved by the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs, is in evidence. The attorneys who are presently parties

to said contract are Lyle Keith and Patrick H. Winston of Spokane,'Washing~

ton, and David Cobb, Abe W. Weissbrodt and I. S. weissbrodt, of Washington,
D. c. ‘

The.Attorneys' Contract provides that the attorneys shall recieve

‘ .

mas compensation a fee of ten percent of the net amount recovered on behalf of the tribes and that there shall be deducted from the fee so calculated the amount of the annual retainers paid to the attorneys under the

.contract.

.Attorneys for the petitioners therefore ask for an award of $100,000.00
(10% of the total net judgment of $1,000,000.00), less the sum of $30,000.00
which has been paid to the attorneys as retainer fees, leaving a net sum
payable to said attorneys of $70,000.00. They further ask that the said

$70,000.00 be all cated and made chargeable against the respective awards

8 Ind. Cl. Com. gas, 435

of the named tribes by determining‘the percentage ratio between the net
recovery awarded each named tribe and the aggregate of $1,000,000.00 in
recoveries, and then apnlying'each such percentage ratio to the net

amount of $70,000.00.

It appears to the Commission that this is in accordance with the

terms of the Attorneys‘ Contract and with the resolution of the Business

Council of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation approving

such an award and allocation. No objections have been made or filed in

— this proceeding.

Attorneys for the petitioner will therefore be awarded attorneys‘
fees as requested, the following net amounts being payable from the

respective recoveries of the named tribes:

Colville Tribe $ 7,322.00
San Poil~Nespelem Tribe 28,763.00
Okanogan Tribe 15,638.00
Methow Tribe 10,031.00
Lake Tribe 8,2h6.00

"" Total $70,000.00

Final Judgment will accordingly be entered in conformity with this
opinion.
