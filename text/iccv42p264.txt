OPINION OF THE COMMISSION
Blue, Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.

In its title decision in this consolidated proceeding, 30 Ind. C1.

Com. 8 (l973), aff'd, 207 Ct. C1. 958 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U. S.

903 (1976), the Commission determined that, as of July 4, 1805, the

effective date of the Treaty of Fort Industry, 7 Stat. 87, five tribes,

as then constituted, each held recognized title to an undivided one-fifth
interest in the lands comprising Royce Areas 53 and S4 in Ohio. The

tribes, and their present-day successors in interest are: (1) the

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 264 255

Delaware Tribe, represented by the plaintiffs in Dockets 27-E and 202;
(2) the Wyandot Tribe, represented by the plaintiffs in Docket 139;
(3) certain bands of Ottawa Indians, represented by the plaintiffs in
Dockets l33—A and 302; (4) the Chippewas of the Saginaw, represented
by the plaintiffs in Docket l3-E; and (5) the Potawatomi Tribe,
represented by the plaintiffs and intervenors in Docket 29-D. Under
the terms of the Fort Industry Treaty, the United States extinguished
the Indians’ title to the tract consisting of Royce Areas 53
and 54.

Trial on value and consideration was held before the Commission
in this consolidated proceeding from April 4 through April 6, 1977.

Royce Areas 53 (the northern portion) and 54 (the southern portion)
form a roughly rectangular tract of land of 2,589,807 acres located in
the north-central portion of the State of Ohio. The combined tract is
bounded on the north by Lake Erie, on the east by the Cuyahoga and
Tuscarawas Rivers and the portage between them, on the south by the
Greeneville Treaty line and on the west by a line 120 miles west of the
Pennsylvania border. The line of 41° north latitude divides Royce Areas
53 and 54. A small six-mile square tract in the northwestern corner
of Royce Area 53 is excluded since it had previously been ceded to the

United States at the Treaty of Greeneville, August 3, 1795, 7 Stat. 49.

Royce Areas 53 and 54 were a part of the Northwest Territory, the '

orderly settlement and political organization of which were enunciated

52 Ind. C1. Comm. 264 257

in the Ordinance of 1787, the substance of which Congress reenacted,
after the Consitution became effective, by the Act of August 7, 1789,
1 Stat. 50.

Until 1794, there was no organized or significant settlement of
the Old Northwest because the resident Indian tribes, with the assistance
of the British based in Canada, resisted American encroachments and
sovereignty. At the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, General Anthony
Wayne's forces broke the back of the Indian resistance. The next year»
the United States and representatives of the various Indian tribes of
the Old Northwest executed the Treaty of Greeneville, E2255, under the
terms of which the United States extinguished Indian title to most of
what later became the State of Ohio and to several strategically located
enclaves, such as Detroit and Chicago, scattered across the Old Northwest.
The treaty also anticipated future cessions of the remaining Indian lands

in the Old Northwest by providing euphemistically that, should the Indians
later "decide" to sell their remaining lands, they could be sold only to
the United States. Over the years that followed the Indians at several
treaties, including the Fort Industry Treaty, relinquished piece-meal

their title to the remainder of the Old Northwest.

Soon after the Greeneville Treaty, settlement commenced in those
portions of Ohio to which Indian title had been extinguished. At the

same time, the Government grappled with the complexities of providing

for the orderly disposition and settlement of the lands it had acquired

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 264 268

and was continuing to acquire from the Indians in the Old Northwest.

In the early 1790's, the Government sold immense tracts of frontier
lands to speculators who, in turn, prepared the lands for sale to
settlers. For several reasons this system failed. In l79b,'the
Government began selling 640 acre tracts directly to settlers at $2

per acre on credit terms. By 1804, the size of the minimum tract
offered for sale had been reduced to 160 acres. The $2 per acre credit
price was maintained but, if cash was paid, the price was set at $1.60
per acre. Government policy was to offer the lands at low prices to
stimulate settlement. The Government price of $2 per acre thus became
the effective maximum price for frontier lands. As settlement progressed
in specific areas prices in those areas tended to increase above $2 per
acre.

In the year 1805, economic indicators reflected expansionary trends.
Gross national product and income from private production were rising.
Agricultural production was increasing and with it agricultural income.
The population of the nation was increasing dramatically.

Ohio had been admitted as a state of the Union on March 1, 1803.

At the valuation date, settlement in Ohio was taking place in the
southern portion of the State, around Cincinnati, and in the northeastern

sector east of the Cuyahoga River. The southern portion of Ohio had been

acquired by the United States in 1795 at the Treaty of Greeneville and,.

within a few years thereafter, portions of these "Greeneville lands,"

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 264 269

comprising 3,150,229 acres, were opened for settlement. In northeastern
Ohio, the Connecticut Land Company, which in 1795 had purchased the
eastern portion of the Western Reserve, a tract of 2,841,471 acres

between the Pennsylvania border and the Cuyahoga River, was selling

these lands to settlers. For various reasons, settlement of southern

Ohio was progressing much more rapidly than settlement in the northeastern
sector. This was so primarily because the main route westward at the

time was the Ohio River. In addition, the Connecticut Land Company

was plagued by serious internal management problems and related financial

difficulties. The public was growing increasingly skeptical of land

speculators. The company's lands were never effectively marketed to
potential settlers.

During the decade 1800 to 1810, the population of Ohio grew from
45,365 to 230,760. As stated above,most of this growth occurred along
the Ohio River where settlers purchased approximately one million acres
during the decade. In contrast, northern Ohio had a white population
of fewer than two persons per square mile in 1805.

In the midst of this situation,the United States, in 1805, acquired
title to Royce Areas 53 and 54. These lands were completely forested and
unsurveyed. The larger rivers were navigable by smaller crafts but
there was no network of roads. Access to these lands was difficult at

best.

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 264 270

The lands themselves were favorable to development. The temperatures
were moderate, precipitation was conducive to agriculture, and the
growing season was long. The terrain was undulating and the soils
productive. Substantial portions of the tract would, however, require
drainage before the lands could be put in agricultural use. The parties
agree that, as of 1805, the highest and best use of the tract was for
subsistence farming by settlers.

The expert witnesses for both plaintiffs and defendant developed
valuation theories utilizing what each considered to be comparable sales.
Plaintiffs’ evidence was of 182 sales of small tracts during the year

1805. All but three of these sales were of lands located east of the

Cuyahoga River in northeastern Ohio in the area known as the Western
Reserve. The average size of these 182 tracts was 209 acres. The
average price was $2.09 per acre, while the median price of all sales
was $2.44 per acre. Plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Roger K. Chisholm, concluded
that $2.40 per acre represented the fair market value in 1805 of the
tract consisting of Royce Areas 53 and 54. This figure was arrived at
by deducting from the median price of $2.44 per acre for the 182 sales

in his analysis, the sum of $.04 per acre to reflect what plaintiffs‘

expert believes to be the very slight chance that some of these sales

were of improved lands.

Defendant's comparable sales approach utilized large-scale transactions

which took place during the last decade of the 18th Century when the

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 264 271

Government was attempting to develop frontier lands by selling large
tracts to speculators who would prepare the lands for settlement and
resell in small tracts. Defendant's expert, Dr. Ernest G. Booth,

considered that the purchase made in 1795 of 2,841,671 acres in northeastern Ohio for $0.422 per acre and purchases made by the Holland Land
Company in 1792 of four tracts in New York and Pennsylvania varying in
size from 700,000 to 1.5 million acres at prices ranging from $0.26 to

$0.40 per acre, were comparable sales upon which to develop an opinion

of the fair market value of Royce Areas 53 and 54 in 1805. On the basis
of this data, Dr. Booth decided that the wholesale value of the subject
tract in 1795 was $0.40 per acre. He then added 5 percent per year ($0.02

per acre per year) and concluded that in 1805 the lands had a value of

$0.60 per acre.

Dr. Booth also utilized alternative approaches, the first of which he
termed the "development approach." Here he estimated a maximum retail
sales price of $2.30 per acre based upon the experience of the Holland

Land Company transactions in western New York. Using a 1 to 4 ratio,

he concluded that $0.575 was a reasonable value per acre (rounded to

$0.60 per acre).

Dr. Booth's other alternative approach was based upon public domain
sales of $2.00 per acre from which he deducted $0.60 for costs of
acquisition, $0.66 as a write-off for marginal lands, and $0.142 for

surveying, selling expense, etc. Under this approach the resulting

value is $0.592 per acre (rounded to $0.60).

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 264 272

In the recently decided case of Saginaw Chippewa Tribe, et al. v.
United States, Dockets 59, et al., 41 Ind. C1. Comm. 327 (1978), this

Comission valued Royce Area 66 located in southeastern Michigan as of
1808. In that case, the parties employed the same expert witnesses who
utilized the same valuation theories and methods. There the Commission
rejected the analyses of both experts. Plaintiffs’ valuation was
rejected for several reasons, the most important of which was that the
lands upon which the sales data were based were not comparable to those
being valued. Defendant's valuation was rejected basically because the
Commission decided that sales of large tracts to speculators over a
decade before the valuation date were not sales comparable to the
hypothetical purchase of Royce Area 66 in 1808.

Other factors considered by the Commission as relevant in its
decision to reject the plaintiffs’ appraisal were: (1) failure to
consider sales data for the Greeneville lands in southern Ohio;l!

(2) failure to take into account that Royce Area 66 in Michigan was
far from the primary paths of westward imigration during the first
decade of the 19th Century; (3) failure to take into account that substantial portions of Royce Area 66 would require drainage before they

would be productive for agriculture; and (4) failure to discount retail

sale price to reflect anticipated holding period and other relevant factors.

l] The Commission made findings regarding these sales in Miami Tribe v.
United States, Dockets 67, et al., 4 Ind. C1. Comm. 366 (1956), aff'd

in part and remanded for add'l findings, 146 Ct. Cl. 421 (1959).

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 264 273

In the case of defendant's expert the Comission recited the

following additional reasons for rejecting his appraisal: excessive

estimates of worthless or marginal lands and excessive discounts for

anticipated holding periods.

In the Saginaw Chippewa case, supra, the expert valuations were
rejected in toto because the lands themselves were not comparable nor
were the circumstances surrounding the sales. In the case we now
have before us, the expert opinions do have some relevancy as we will
explain hereinafter, although we must reject or modify certain of the
assumptions upon which the experts formulated their respective opinions.

In the instant case, both experts have utilized the same lands as
comparable. These are the lands of the eastern portion of the Western
Reserve in northeastern Ohio. What the respective experts have done
is to look at these same lands from different ends of the spectrum of
frontier development. Defendant's expert has based his opinion of value
upon the wholesale purchase in 1795 by the Connecticut Land Company of
2.8 million acres of the Western Reserve at slightly more than $0.40
per acre, while plaintiffs‘ expert has based his analysis upon recorded
sales during 1805 of small tracts within these same Western Reserve lands.

Furthermre, the lands offered as comparable in this case are
contiguous to Royce Areas 53 and 54. The topography, soil formations,

climate and other relevant factors are similar. Therefore, in our case,

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 264 274

we are willing to accept that the lands utilized by each expert were

comparable to the lands we are valuing. It does not necessarily follow,

however, that the sales of these comparable lands were comparable to the

hypothetical sale of Royce Areas 53 and 54. We do not believe they were

for reasons we will explain infra. For this reason and because both

experts have exaggerated, ignored (or in one or more ways otherwise
distorted) factors which affected the fair market value in 1805 of Royce
Areas 53 and 54, we cannot accept the ultimate opinion of either expert

as to the value of the subject tract.

The most significant omission in both experts‘ reports is their
failure to consider in their analyses, the effect which the active

market for the Government's Greeneville lands in southern Ohio had upon

the fair market value of Royce Areas 53 and 54 in 1805. The Greeneville
lands, over 3 million acres, were opened for settlement in 1800. Between
1800 and 1810, one-third of these lands were sold to settlers at $2 per
acre. During this period the Greeneville lands were being disposed of

at an approximate rate of 3 percent per year. See Miami Tribe v. United

States, Dockets 67 et al., supra n.l. The Greeneville lands were the

primary location for settlement in Ohio during the early 19th Century
because of their location near the Ohio River. These lands were being

settled at a much faster rate than the Connecticut Land Company's lands

in northeastern Ohio.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 264 275

The availability for settlement in Ohio of both the 3 million acre
Greeneville lands and the nearly 3 million acre Connecticut Land Company
tract, the prices at which lands were selling in each, and the comparative
rates of settlement in each, would have been significant factors in any
negotiations for the sale of Royce Areas 53 and 54 between a knowledgeable
buyer and seller. Specifically, such hypothetical parties would have
been aware that the maximum forseeable retail price for small tracts
offered for sale would have been $2 per acre. It would also be apparent,
however, that imigration into Ohio would continue to increase and that
Royce Areas 53 and 54 were so located that settlement within the reasonably near future would be inevitable. A liquidation period of from 15
to 20 years would have been anticipated.

Turning to plaintiffs’ appraisal, we believe that their expert's
failure to apply the customary discounts to retail price is clearly
erroneous and not in accord with existing law. §gg_Saginaw Chippewa

Tribe v. United States, supra, at 336-37. The principle is well-settled

 

that it is proper in valuing a large tract of frontier land to deduct
from the retail sales prices of comparable lands an amount reflecting
such factors as the time and expense required to dispose of such a large

tract. Eg. Nez Perce Tribe v. United States, 176 Ct. Cl. 815, 824 (1966),

cert. denied, 386 U. S. 984 (1967) (aff'g in part, rev'g in part Docket

 

175—B, 13 Ind. Cl. Comm. 184 (1964)); Sac and Fox Tribe v. United States,

Docket 83, 32 Ind. Cl. Comm. 320 (1973), aff'd, 206 Ct. Cl. 898 (1975).

 

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 264 276

The 179 Ohio sales and 3 Michigan sales which constitute the entire

basis for Dr. Chisholm's valuation are simply too few to be accepted as

representative of the value of a 2.5 million acre tract. Such evidence

is helpful in establishing that (1) small tracts of similar lands relatively

close to Royce Areas 53 and 54 were selling in 1805 at an average retail
price of slightly in excess of $2 per acre and (2) sales of such retail
tracts were proceeding slowly in 1805.

In the case of defendant's expert's valuation, we immediately note
that the Court of Claims has previously determined that it is "unthinkable"

to predicate wholesale value of a large tract of land upon evidence of the

prices paid by land speculating companies in the 18th Century. Miami

 

Tribe v. United States, 146 Ct. Cl. at 467 n.6, supra. Since Dr. Booth's

"comparable sales" approach is based upon such sales it must be rejected.
As to Dr. Booth's "development" approach, we believe that his deductions
of 75 percent of estimated retail sales price are excessive in light of
the evidence. Finally, under his "Government sales" approach, his
estimates of costs of acquiring, surveying, and preparing the lands for
settlement are much too high. Furthermore, his write-off of one-third
for marginal lands is without any evidentiary foundation.
In our opinion, persons negotiating in 1805 for the sale of 2.5

million acres in north-central Ohio would have been aware of a myriad

of factors which would have influenced the price a potential buyer would

be willing to pay and the price a potential seller would have been willing

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 264 277

to accept. These factors would include the physical characteristics of
the land, the climate, existing settlement and population patterns,
access to the lands, economic conditions, public land policies, and
availability of other lands for settlement. Available information relating to demand for and sales of similar lands would be merely one factor
they would consider. United States v. Emigrant New York Indians, 177

Ct. Cl. 263, 285 (1966) (a§£:g Docket 75, ll Ind. Cl. Comm. 336 (1962)).

Parties negotiating in 1805 for the hypothetical sale of Royce
Areas 53 and 54 would be aware that then-existing patterns of settlement
tended to follow the Ohio River in the general area of which several
million acres of Government lands were open for settlement. Furthermore,
the parties would know that in northeastern Ohio sales of retail tracts
by the Connecticut Land Company were proceeding very slowly both
because the lands were off the then main path of immigration and also
because the Company was unable to market the lands effectively. But they
would also be aware that resales of small tracts in northeastern Ohio
were averaging slightly above $2 per acre.

The hypothetical buyer and seller would also know that in 1805 the
subject tract was forest-covered, unsurveyed, and lacked an internal
system of roads. They would also know that while drainage was a prerequisite to agricultural development, the tract would, after drainage,

surely be a very productive agricultural area.

42 Ind. c1. Comm. 264 273

The parties would take into account that the general economic
picture in the nation and in Ohio was favorable. Furthermore, they
could reasonably predict that continued heavy settlement in southern
Ohio would soon create a situation where demand for land in northern
Ohio would increase substantially.

Given all these factors we believe that the hypothetical buyer and
seller would reasonably conclude that the subject tract would be settled
over a period of from 15 to 20 years and that potential retail sales
price of small tracts would be very close to the $2 Government sales
price of frontier lands.

From our base figure of $2 per acre, certain discounts must be
taken. The anticipated liquidation period of between 15 and 20 years,
based upon demand and size of the tract, requires, in our opinion, a
discount of 40 percent. Costs of survey, and otherwise preparing the
lands for settlement, would amount to no more than 5 percent. There is
no need to discount for improvements since we are using the $2 per acre
Government price as a base. Nor is a discount required to reflect the
necessity to drain portions of the tract. §gg_Miami Tribe v. United
States, 9 Ind. Cl. Com. 1, 9-10 (1960). Thus, considering all the
factors, we conclude that the fair market value in 1805 of the 2,589,807
acres of Royce Areas 53 and 54 was $1.10 per acre or a total of
$2,848,787.70.

A few other matters require comment. As in the Saginaw Chippewa

case, supra, plaintiffs cite the recent decision in the case of Joint

Council of Passamaguoddy Tribe v. Morton, 528 F.2d 370 (lst Cir., 1975)

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 264 279

in support of their argument that the lands should be valued at retail

price for small tracts. In Saginaw Chippewa, we held that Passamaguoddy

was not in point. 41 Ind. Cl. Comm. at 337. We reaffirm that holding
here. We also reaffirm our holding in the Saginaw Chippewa case that
inflation and consequent dollar devaluation cannot be taken into account.
41 Ind. Cl. Com. at 338.

The parties basically agree regarding consideration. We have
determined that the total consideration for the cession of Royce Areas
53 and 54 was $32,666.65. The defendant used 5 percent in calculating
commuted value of annuities provided for in the treaty. Article V of
the treaty, however, states that $2,916.67 had been set aside to produce
an annuity of $175, which works out to a 6 percent interest rate. Thus,
6 percent should be used. We have distributed the $12,000 provided
under Article V to the Potawatomies, Ottawas, and Chippewas as the
evidence establishes it was actually distributed, not in equal shares
as the plaintiffs propose.

Consideration of $32,666.65 for lands having a fair market value

of $2,848,787.70 was so grossly inadequate as to render it unconscionable

within the meaning of section 2 (3) of the Indian Claims Commission Act.

The defendant is entitled, however, to credit for the entire
consideration paid as payments on the claim. We have allocated that

consideration among the tribes as follows:

Wyandots $8,333.33
Delawares 8,333.33
Chippewas 6,133.33
Ottawas 6,133.33

Potawatomies 3,733.33

42 Ind. c1. Comm. 264 230

The respective plaintiffs and intervenors are entitled to recover
from defendant the following net sums less any offsets, as determined in
subsequent proceedings, to which the defendant may be entitled: to the
Wyandot plaintiffs, $561,424.21; to the Delaware plaintiffs, $561,424.21;
to the Chippewa plaintiffs, $563,624.21; to the Ottawa plaintiffs,
$563,624.21; to the Potawatomi plaintiffs and intervenors, $566,024.21.

An order will be entered accordingly.
