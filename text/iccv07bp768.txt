Defendant.

Decided: July 23, 1959

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS 93 FACT

The Commission makes the following findings of fact which are
supplemental to the findings numbered 1 to 18, inclusive, heretofore

made herein (h Ind. Cl. Co. . 5h9):

19. The Commission has earlier in this case decided that petitioner

 

herein, The Snohomish.Tribe, held aboriginal Indian title to certain lands
in what is now the State of Washington which were ceded to the United
States by the Treaty of January 22, I855, 12 Stat. 927, and that the
United States extinguished petitioner's Indian title to said lands on
March 8, 1859, the effective date of the treaty (1; Ind. Cl. Comm. 519).
The lands found to have been exclusively used and occupied by the
Snohomish Indians are set out in said prior decision in Finding l7.
Said lands will hereinafter be referred to as the subject tract or the
Snohomish tract. This trial has been held to determine the value of
said lands as of March 8, 1859.

20. (a) The Snohomish tract as described in our prior findings,

generally speaking, is an area of land that includes the south ends of

‘Whidby Island and Camano Island.and all of Gedney, or t, Island.

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 768 769

The tract also includes a portion of the mainland fronting on the Sound
stretching from Muki tee in a northerly direction to'Warm Beach and

easterly in the south, generally speaking, to the old intersection of

'the Snohomish, Snoqualmie and Skykomish Rivers and to Granite City in

the north. The tract is fully described in Finding 17, as amended, in
our previous determination. The lands on the islands are located in
Island County in what is now the State of'Washington while the lands on
the mainland are in Snohomish County. The tract as set forth in Finding

l7 contains l6h,26S acres of land which includes 2h,32O acres of land in

the Tulalip Indian Reservation, sometimes referred to as the Snohomish
Reservation, which was set apart by Article 3 of the 1855 treaty "for

the purpose of establishing thereon an agricultural and industrial school,

,* *,*, and with a view of ultimately drawing thereto and settling thereon

all the Indians living west of the Cascade Mountains in said Territory.”
(b)g The subject tract on the mainland is irregular in shape and
is deeply indented in its western or coastal border by the waters of.
Port Gardner.~ The portion of the tract on the mainland is drained by
the Sqohomish,Riyer and its tributary, the Pulchuck or Pilchuck. At
least 20 percent of this mainland portion of the tract lies in the low,
broad valley of the Snohomish River and the narrow, entrenched valley of
the Pilchuck River. There were good soils but fairly extensive swamp
and marshy lands along the Snohomish River which later were diked and
drained before cultivable. Some agricultural land is found in the
Pilchuck Valley also. The Snohomish River was navigable while the

Pilchuck was navigable only for canoes. Aside from the broad, low delta

7

'. (AI wax

and the valleys of the Snohonish and Pilchuck Rivers the mainland
portion is made up of somewhat hilly and broken land. Gedney Island
rises rather abruptly from the wcters of the Sound but the interior is
comparatively level with good soi_. The lands in the tract which are
located on the southern end of'Whidby Island were for the most part
high, rolling, and hilly with the shore line banks abrupt. The same
condition existed as to the lands on the southern part of Camano Island
within the subject tract.

(c) The climate of the area is controlled by the moderating influences of the Pacific Ocean. The winters are mild and the summers
cool. There is an abundance of rain, providing for a damp climate
during the entire year with the exception of a relatively dry period
during July and August.

21. The land in the subject tract consisting of l6h,26S acres is

classified as follows:

9

Bottom or Potential Agricultural Land ........... 12,153 acres
Accessible Timberland ........................... S6,h6? acres
Inaccessible Timberland ......................... 65,790 acres
Marsh, Overflow or Swampland .................... 2h,830 acres

Inland'waters ...................;........;...... ’S,O2S acres
An undisclosed, but considerable amount; of the marsh and overflow lands
would be considered potential agricultural land that would need diking
and drainage.

22. The slowness of settlement of the Puget Sound area prior to
the l880's can be attributed to its physical inaccessibility and the

lack of transportation facilities. As of'l8§9 all the communities of

western.washington were virtually dependent upon water transportation.

? Ind. Cl. Com. 768 771

There were few roads and no rai roads in the area. The construction of
railroads west of the Mississippi was delayed until sufficient funds
were available, which funds generally were derived from the sale of
lands granted the railroad. The first transcontinental rail service
was to California in 1869. The Northern Pacific Railroad to the'West

Coast was completed in 1883 and did not reach the Puget Sound area until

1887.

123. By Act of Congress the Territory of Oregon was established
on August lh, l8h8 (9 Stat. 323). This territory included the present
States of Oregon, Washington and Idaho. The Territory of'Washington
was created by the Act of Congress of March 2, 1853 (10 Stat. l7?) and
included the present States of Washington and Idaho. The Act of March 3,
l863.(l2 Stat. 808) created the Territory of Idaho and established the
eastern boundary of the present State of'washington. On November llxo
1589, Washington was admitted to the Union as a state.

i2k.8 The first American settlers arrived in the Puget Sound area
in l8h§. ébd in 1851 they established the first Puget Sound town,
TumRa§§?, near the present site of Olympia. Nhidby Island'was the nert
area to attract settlers and during the years 1850 to 1855 many of the
settlers reaching the Puget Sound region found their way to'Whidby
Island. The early settlers on this island concentrated in the prairie
area around Penn Cove to the north of the part of the subject tract on
‘ht island. A sawmill, known as the Tidewater Hill, was located at
P938 Cove. South of the mainland portion of the tract the site of the

Present city of Seattle was platted in 1853. Island County in 1858

"- 9:4. ‘.1 "

 

7 Ind. Cl. Con. 768

reportedly had a population of 180 with most of the settlers on Whidby“
Island. Some hO whites are said to have been on the mainland portion

of the tract by 1861 principally around Tulalip Bayu

Timber

The Puget Sound area lies in a band of heavy timber which

25.

covers virtually the entire area west of the Cascade Mountains. In

I fact, reports indicate that nearly 9/lOths of Washington's timber is

in that area. The Douglas fir forns about 7/8ths of the forest growth.

There is also valuable timber such as red cedar and hemlock. In l899,

Henry Gannett, Chief of the Division of Geography and Forestry for the
Department of the Interior, reported that "with the exception of the

redwoods of California, the forests of'Washington are the densest,

heaviest, and most continuous in the United States. ‘Except for a few

prairie openings, and except where removed by fire or the ax, they

cover the country as a thick mantle from high up on the Cascade Range

westward to the shore of the Pacific.i

This county extends from.the crest of the Cascade Range
to Puget Sound. The eastern part is composed of high and
rugged mountains, and contains little, if any,.merchantable
timber. The western half was originally forested, with the

exception of a few tracts of prairie. Logging has, however,
‘been carried on extensively in this county, two-fifths of I
the area formerly timbered having been stripped by the ax.

‘Burns have not been extensive or destructive.

Of Island County, Gannet wrote:

This comprises a group of islands in the northern part
of Puget Sound, including'Whidby and Camano Islands. These
‘islands originally were entirely covered with fir forests,
but have been almost completely denuded by the ax.

He reported on Snohomish County;

Tu

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 758 773

26. In.the subject tract there were on the average approxinately
12,000 board feet of timber per acre on the accessible timberlands and
11,000 board feet per acre on the inaccessible timberlands, made up of
the following species and amounts thereof:

Red Fir (Douglas) . . . . ..... 50%

Cedar ..................... 25%

Hemlock ................... 15%

Lesser Species ............ 10%
An undetermined but small amount of the timber on the subject tract had
been burned or damaged prior to the valuation date.

27. In.tbe early days of our colonial history, the forests werer
generally regarded as inexhaustible and were in many instances considered
a 1iability'rather than an asset, since many of the early settlers were
interested in.the use of the land for agriculture and grazing purposes
and the clearing of lands for those purposes was a burdensome and expensive process. Thatwwas the attitude of some of the early Oregon'washington settlers where fires were started by them.in the forests as
an aid in clearing the land.s However, there also existed a recognition
of the needior timberforhomes and local industries as dell as for
3hiPbUilding and enport.‘Frcm a comnercial standpoint the lumber industry in this country had its beginning in Maine, and gradually extended along the Atlantic seaboard and then into the Great Lakes region
in 1350. Lumbering operations of any importance did not reach the
Oregon-Washington area until about 1890 to 1900 although shipments of

timber began.on Puget Sound around 1850. The earliest commercial uses

made of the vast timber resources were for spars and pilings. The huge

D

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 76*

C

77%

trees were out by the settlers and dragged to the waters’ edge to be
sold and loaded on ships for transportation to the world markets.

28. The first sawmill on Puget Sound was a small waterpower mill
at a site named New Market, How Tumwater, near the present city of
Olympia, Washington. In September l852, there were three sawmills in
operation in what became'washington Territory. Two years later there
were thirty-three sawmills in operation in Washington Territory. In
1855 there were twenty—four sawmills in the Puget Sound area. All the
sawmills were constructed along the waters of the Sound or on the banks
of rivers whose waters could be utilized in transporting the logs as
well as providing power for the saws. The first steam plant sawmill

was Yesler's mill built in present Seattle in the winter of l852—3.

 It had a capacity of 10,000 to 15,000 board feet paz- day and became
 J, .

the main industry in Seattle and for years furnished employment for
the local inhabitants. ilsland County had one sawmill in 1860.

29. The early lumbering operations were very crude. The logging
was done by manpower. Trees were felled by ax, which was used until the
early 1880's when the cross-cut saw came into use. The trees were cut,
into logs of a length which menc:ould handle and were rolled or dragged
to the nearest water to be floated to a sawmill. Because of the laborious
operation, the timber was cut slowly. The timber first cut was that
along the waters of the Sound and those streams which could be used to
drive logs. Even as late as 1888 it was reported that the forests
along the shores of Puget Sound, the trait of Juan de Fuca, and the

lower Columbia River had been culled only of the best trees for a

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 768 775

distance of only one to two miles inland. In the Department of lnteriorYs

Census Office Report on the Forests of North America, by Charles S.

 

Sargent (l88b) it is reported:

The methods adopted by the lumbermen of western'Qashington territory are wasteful in the extreme. Loggers out only
timber growing within a mile or a mile andazhalf of shores
accessible to good booming or shipping points or which will
yield not less than 30,000 feet of lumber to the acre. Only
trees are out which will produce at least three logs 2h feet
long, with a minimum diameter of 30 inches. Trees are out
not less than 12 and often 20 feet from the ground, in order
that the labor of cutting through the thick bark and enlarged
base may'be avoided, while b0 or 50 feet of the top of the tree

are entirely wasted.

30. In keeping with the early settlers‘ attitude toward the liability
of seeminglr inexhaustible forests and his desire to clear land, was the
feeling of the lumberman who cared little whether the timber he took legally belonged to him or not. lTimber was out indiscriminately from.a
neighbor's land, railroad land, or the public domain. It has been reported thatPuget Sound was the center of uholesale timber stealing. In

1861 measures were taken to suppress this illegal activity and the areas’

ileadingMlumbermen from Port Gamble, Port Madison, and Seabeck (all

lumbering centers ontknzshores of the southern part of Puget Sound)
'wereindicted. lThe usual penalty upon afindingofguiltr'masipa§ment
forfdmaland upon which the timber was out plus a jail.sentence of “an
hour of jolly communion" with the court, the prosecution and the defense.
In an effort to prevent spoliation of public timber a charge of
$2.50 a thousand was made for timber out on government'land, This
"stumpage fee" was opposed by mill men of Puget Sound,'who felt the

price was exhorbitant since the land, if surveyed, could be offered

 

for sale at $1.25 per acre. An agent sent west during the Grand administration found that since l855 on Puget Sound alone timber to the
value of not less than $h0,000,000 had been stolen from the government.
During this period a common term in the Pacific Northwest was "round
fortyt" A settler would acquire b0 to l60 acres of land; then he would
out not only the timber on his own land but on the surrounding land on
all four sides. Before he was through cutting, he would have cut from
160 to 6&0 acres of timber from this government land in addition to his
own h0 to l60 acres.
Agriculture

31. (a) The subject tract contained some fertile land mostly along
the valleys of the Snohonish and Pilchuck Rivers. The earliest farming
was undertaken.above the tidelands and at the mouth of the Snohonish
River. The productive soil accounted for about 20% of the land but a
great deal of the potential agricultural land would require clearing at

a high cost per acre or as in the case of the marshy or overflow lands

lneeded to be diked or drained before cultivation.

—it(b)' The l86O census listed 366,156 acres in the Washington Territory as farmland. This compared with 2,060,539 acres of farmland in
Oregon Territory. In 1870 there were 9h farms in Island County consisting
Of 7,275 acres of improved land and 15,280 acres unimproved. Total
acreage of Island County was l3l,8h0 acres. In Snohomish County there
were l22 farms consisting of l,h73 acres improved and 17,785 unimproved
lands. Snohomish County contained l,3hL,000 acres. The early history

of the entire Washington Territory and in particular the Puget Sound

..._|_

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 768 777

area indicates that the use of land for agricultural purposes was almost
exclusively for the subsistence of the settlers.
32. (a) Under the Oregon Donation Act of September 27, 1850
(9 Stat. E96) settlers were able to acquire a right to land in the
Oregon.Territory, which included the present State of Washington. The
Act originally provided for grants of 320 acres to single, and 6hO acres
to married, white settlers who had settled on the land claimed prior to
December 1, 1850. The.Act required that the settlers live on the land
ifor four years, cultivate and improve it for their own use and not as
agent for anyone else; that no town lots, mineral lands or lands reserved for public purposes could be selected. The act~linited the
donations to one per person. Actual proof of a settler's compliance
guith all the terns of the act was required before a patenthcould issue,
4 and no patent could issue until the land was surveyed by the government
_ $“¥7VeY°’ ' 7   5
(b) In 1851, 58 entries'were made in the'WashingtonTerritory
;:,,§n§er the Sonation Act, and in 1852 there were ll? entries.g The Free

,,e§§tion Act of September h, l8hl, was made applicable to Washington in

. .-L

H}35h., Under the Preemption Act, any person who did not own.land in the
Territory or who was not the proprietor of 320 acres of land in any
other State or Territory, might secure 160 acres of public land at
31-25 P€r_acre provided the land was surveyed, the Indian title extinguished, actual settlement made with a dwelling erected, and the
settler living on the land. In 1859 the total acreage taken in the

‘w35hin8t0n.Territory under the Donation and Preemption Acts totaled

ll,2?7 and this increased in l860 to l7,97h acres. The total number

of donation certificates and acres of land granted in'washington and
Oregon xas:

Oregon -- 7,317 certificates; 2,563,757.02 acres
Washington -- 985 certificates; 290,215.35 acres
(c) The Homestead Act was enacted May 20, 1862 (l2 Stat. 392)

permitting settlers to acquire farms of l60 acres (or 80 acres on land
selling for $2.50 per acre) free except for a nominal filing fee. The
Act required cultivation, improvements and five years’ actual occupancf.
However, any person claiming under the Act could secure title before the
expiration of the five years by the payment of the minimum price of the
land selected ($1.25 or $2.50 per acre). ;

(d) Public land could also be acquired by the location of military

land bounty warrants, under the Act of February ll, 18b? (9 Stat. 125),

8' 3 and of agricultural college scrips, under the Act of July 2, 1862 (12

Stat. 503).

(e) The Timber and Stone Act of 1878 (20 Stat. 89) permitted the
sale of timber lands in quantities not‘exceeding 160 acres per person
and at a minimum price of $2.50 per acre.

(f) The rate at which the land in the Snohomish tract which was
available for acquisition passed from federal to private ownership was

as follows:

33. (a) There is no evidence of any sales of land comparable in

H9

size, character or location to the Snohomish tract prior to 1859. lnere
‘were, however, several sales which were similar in certain respects to
the land involved in this case. The Pope and Talbot firm, the Puget

Zhill Company, was one of the early purchasers of tracts of timber land.

This company was one of the largest sawmill companies with a mill at

Port Gamble on the western-side of the Sound. Under the Act creating

the Washington Territory, two townships of land were allowed for financing.

the University. The land could be sold for not less than $1.50 per acre.

Pope and.Talbot were permitted to select the best of this University land

and the records show purchases of 787.75 acres in 1861; 565.50 acres in

P 1862; and l7,h50 acres in 1863, all at a purchase price of $1.50 per

i acre. The land so purchased was choice, accessible timberland, not more

A than a mile to a mile and a half from the shoreline of the Sound and within the immediate vicinity of the Port Gamble mill. Pope and Talbot also

is utilized military scrip to acquire 17,398 acres in l863 but the exact

:iPTiCé§paid cannot be determined. “The Puget Mill Company purchased

p2,8h9.75 acres in Island County for about $1.05 per acre in l866.+ From

la 1375 through the 1880's, Pope and Talbot purchased numerous 160-acre

tracts on a selective basis within a mile and a half of salt water at
3b°ut $3.12 per acre, with an occasional purchase slightly above or
below this figure.

(b) The first sale by the Northern Pacific Railroad Company was
in December, l87l, when it sold 2h.69 acres north of Kalama on the

Columbia River at a price of $5.00 per acre. The first sale of more

 

r‘

than 200 acres was in Eav of 18?a. That involved a tract of 90.36
acres on the Jisquallw Plains which sold for $3.15 per acre. From

July 1, 1883, until June 30, l88h, the railroad sold a total of

-FF»

lh7,hS0.h9 acres in hashington for h.?O per acre.

(c) The first large purchase of'Hashington timber land was made
on January 31, 1900, when the famous'deyerhaeuser Timber Company purchased 900,000 acres of the finest'washington timber land from the
Northern Pacific for a price of $6.00 per acre. Of the 900,000 acres
so purchased 18,788.26 were located in Snohomish County.

38. The highest and best use for which the Snohcmish lands was
adaptable as of March 8, 1859, was timber production.

35. There were no mineral deposits of any importance known to be
present on the Snohomish tract as of March 8, 1859.

36. (a) Mr. James A. Crutchfield, a professor of economics at the
University of‘Nashington, appeared as a witness for petitioner. This
witness testified that he used two methods of evaluating the subject
tract. The first method he used to determine value was on the basis
of the actual commercial use which land might have and secondly he used
a method to arrive at a "subsistence valuation."

(b) Mr. Crutchfield in his report states (Pet. Ex. la) that he
arrived at his estimate of value based on the actual commercial use
‘which the land might have by following the procedure outlined in earlier

cases. The cases referred to by petitioner's witness are The Nooksack

 

Tribe v. United tates, 6 Ind. Cl. Comm. 578, and Muckleshoot Tribe v.

   

United States, 6 End. C1. Comm. 608. In these prior determinations this

Commission set forth fully in its findings of fact the methods u

U}
(D
D»

by the witness and in its opinions stated Mr. Crutchfield's opinion

of value could not be given much weight since his method of valuation
was not in accordance with legally approved standards but rather involves methods based on conjecture and speculation, “which methods«have;
been specifically rejected by the courts and this Commission." Mr.
Crutchfield's opinion based on his "subsistence value” method was rejected in these prior cases as being entirely theoretical and as one

not based upon any judicially accepted method of evaluating land.

37. Mr. C. Marc Miller, a qualified appraiser of Seattle,

Washington, testified as an expert-witness for defendant and prepared

ta written valuation report (Def. Ex. 205-A) which contains a wealth

of material pertaining to the subject tract.» Mr. Miller used as his
yardstick in reaching his opinion as to value the fair market value
approach.p Defendant's appraiser took into consideration the many

factors considered in evaluating lands such as the sizes of the tracts,

~3°C93$ibility, surrounding sales, taxes, transportation, population,

demand for land, markets, financial investment, risks and need for a_

return on investment and profit. Defendant's witness was of the opinion

to

that the full fair market value of the subject tract as of March 8, 1859,
was the sum of $16,200.00, or at the rate of approximately $0.12 per acre.
38-, Upon the basis of the findings of fact herein made, and there

record as a whole, the Commission finds that the Snohomish tract, con_sisting of l6h,265 acres of land, had a fair market value as of March.8,

1859,

05 $150,700.00, or at the average rate of approximatel? $1.10

39. The case will now proceed to a determination of the consideration

paid to the Snohomish Indians, if anv, under the provisions oi the Treaty

it

of January 22, l8SS, supra; and whether the consideration so paid, if any,
was unconscionable. At the further hearing the case will also proceed

to a determination of the interest retained by the Snohomish Indians in

ithe Tulalip Reservation, set aside by Article 3 of the l8S treaty for

petitioner and other Indians which interest will be based on the ratio

of the average population of petitioner tribe on said reservation to the
average of the total population upon said reservation, and appropriate
deduction for such retained interest will be made from the gross value of
the subject tract at the average rate of $1.10 per acre; and to a consideration, if necessary, of what offsets are chargeable against said

Snohomish Indians under the provisions of the Indian Claims Commission

Act.
