OPINION OF THE COMMISSION

0‘1"Iarr, Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.

Petitioner, the Crow Tribe, filed its petition with this Commission
setting forth a claim under Section 2(3) of the Indian Claims Commission
Act, alleging therein that the Crow Tribe had, on May 7, l868, 15 Stat,
649, ceded 30,530,761.'v,8 acres of land to the United States, being allegedly
part of the lands the ownership and right of occupancy, possession and use
of which were acknowledged, ratified and confirmed to be in said Crow Tribe’

by the Treaty of Fort Laramie, September 17, l85l, ll Stat. 71:9, Petitioner

further alleged that the consideration paid to the Crow_;_ Tribe as stipulated in the 1868 treaty was grossly inadequate and unconscionable.

Defendant in its answer: set forth several affirmative legal defenses
which, by stipulation of the parties and order of the Commission, were

made the issues involved in a prior hearing limited to a determination of
the defenses thus raised by defendant. The Commission made findings of

fact upon these issues and rendered an opinion thereon which was adverse

to the defendant (3-Ind. Cl. Comm. 111?, and 868 Explanatory Statement,
Findings of Fact herein made). The Commission, having in 3 Ind. Cl. Comm.

lands of the Crows  the Treaty of Fort Laramie, su ra, ordered (Order of

October 12 S) the parties to proceed to a final hearing to determine _

all issues not previously disposed of, including the question of the consideration paid for the cession and the value of the land as of the date

of the cession of May 7, 1868, leaving for further consideration the

question of offsets, if any.

The lands involved are a part of the reservation set aside for the

Crow Tribe by the Fort Laramie Treaty. The parties are agreed that 

lands ceded by the 1868 treaty by the Crows to the United States
to 30,530,'?6h.8 acres.

Petitioner agrees that the consideration paid. :ifo;:t=
the cession amounts to $1,6hh,5'8S.h9 (Pet. Ex. 21]., G. A. 0. Repair‘? 

Pet. Br., page 68). The ceded area lies partly in Montana and partly in

Wyoming. The Crow Tribe reserved from the cession as a reservation

of land of 8 ,OOO,hO9.2 acres within the boundaries of the area s:s2:*-8:,

the Fort Laramie Treaty.

The ceded tract consisted of a large and diverse area with prairie lands, mountain lands, intermountain valleys and basins and low mountain

and foothill lands. The climate of the ceded area was likewise diversified with considerable precipitation in the rugged and high mountains and

quite arid regions in the basins.

cally well suited for stock raising and parts of the ceded lands were

adapatable to agricultural production. The tract was watered principally

by the Tongue , Powder , Big Horn and Yellowstone rivers.

Most of the area, however, was climati...

As of the date of the cession, Crow Territory was virtually surrounded

by other Indian lands held as reservations or hunting grounds by other
. . -- -.3; :

tribes. Crow Territory itself was hunted over by other tribes';"is.uch as the

Sioux, Arapahoe and Shoshone, 'v':_:_st herds o1'fou1"1'aJ.o roamed the area.
The character of the lands within the ceded area was fairly well
known by the date of the cession. Fur trappers and traders, prospectors
and both official and unofficial expenditions reconnoitering for wagon
roads had criss-crossed their way over the region. It was generally
known by 1868 that parts of the ceded area were adaptable to stock raising and that some areas in the river valleys were suitable for irrigated
agricultural pursuits. t was principally the belief that the mineral
resources of the Crow Territory were valuable, however, that caused
officials of Montana Territory and mineral prospectors  both Montana

and Wyoming to urge that a cession be obtained from the Crow Tribe. It

was the mining prospector and the discovery of minerals, especially gold,

that brought about the settlement of lands adjoining the Crow Territory‘

and the first white settlement with;n the ceded area.

~ 6115

The discovery of gold in northern and western Montana in l862 and
l86l& resulted in the settlement of the valleys in the mountainous region
adjoining the western boundary of Crow Territory while discovery of _ gold
in 1867 in the vicinity of South Pass, Wyonxing, resulted in the establishment of a small mi.ni.ng town, Miner's Delight, just within Crow Territory
and the settlement also of a few settlers in the Popo .=’-‘=.gie valleys who
raised crops to supply the mining communities. It was the establishment
of the mining camps’ in western and northern Montana that led to the laying
out of wagon roads across Crow Territory to connect these communities with
the transcontinental routes running across the plains of southern Wyoming.
The Bozeman and Bridger trails were established in 1864 and 1865 for this
purpose.

The westward tide of immigration, the construction of these roads
from the transcontinental routes to the mining comzunities in Montana,
with the resulting travel to and fro, the establishment of military forts
to protect the routes and the prospecting for and discovery of minerals
upon Indian land were among the many causes leading to the outbreak of
Indian hostilities with the Sioux and their allies in 1866, which  to
continue until at least l87'f. Attempts to peacefully terminate these
hostilities in l868 resulted in the closing of the wagon roads across ‘th-1:‘!
ceded area and the abandonment of the military forts.

In l868, the white population of '.-.’yo:*.1i.1‘1g Territory’ was psrrzall 
found for the most part in temporary mining camps and along the I'.1.t“‘t;:-cw  
Union Pacific Railroad which by that year had been completed 1:»:  '

some l'?5 miles southeast of the ceded area. Settlement in Not;  3

‘6ll6

found also for the most part in and near the mining communities in
westem and northern Montana. The Federal Census for l87O gave the
population of wyo2:u'.ng Territory as 93.18 and of Montana Territory as
20.595. As of 3.868, the inhabitants of Montana optimistically looked
forward to the coming of the Northern Pacific Railroad through that territory but it was known that such an event would be a number of years in
the future. The Northern Pacific was chartered and received its grant in
1864 to construct a railroad irom Lake Superior to Puget Sound. The route
ultimately followed through Crow Territory along the Yellowstone was under
active consideration prior to the date of the 1868 cession. Construction
of the railroad did not comtnence until l870 and due to the financial panic
of 1873 it did not reach Montana  1881. In support of its contention that the consideration paid for the

l868 cession was grossly inadequate, petitioner presented two expert witnesses, Doctor Merril G. Burlingame, historian, who is head of the Department of History md Government, Montana State College, and Mr. I-Eont H.
Saunderson, a real estate appraiser and ranch economist of Bozeraan, Montana.

Mr. Norman B. Plummer, a professional real estate appraiser of Portland,

Oregon, testified as an expert witness for defendant and Doctor .51, F. Vass,‘ i

a ranch economist from the University of Wyoming, also testified for the
United States. 1".r.‘,'Saunderson and Mr. Plumraer also submitted written
reports containing much information pertaining to the elements or factors
normally considered in fimg a valuation such as the topography, climate,

soils, settlement, accessibility, and adaptability of the ceded area.

6 ll?

The appraisers for both parties agree that the value of the ceded

area as of the date of the cession is to be determined by its fair market
value as of that date. Their opinions as to its value are based principally on the application of the market data, or comparable sales approach.
Both Mr. Saunderson and Mr. Plnmmer recognized that because of the remote
date of'valuation it was necessany to consider sales uithin and outside

of the ceded area for some years following the date of valuation. The
appraisers also were of the opinion that/Zgged area was adaptable to

a number of economic uses. iMr. Saunderson arrived at his opinion that the
ceded area had a value as of May 7, l868, valued as a unit, of $25,870,025.00,
or approximately $ .85 per acre on the average, by assigning values based
upon market data analrses to the land in terms of its highest and.best use

as applied to natural range and resource types, as follows:

It was the opinion of defendant's witness, Mr. Plummer, that the ceded
area as of may-7, 1868, had a value of$2,425,000, or about 8 cents per acre,

several large classes of land which he considered existed in the Ceiei cgep

Although the appraisers seem to agree t-.at the ma- ket data approach i
the proper one principally to apply in deterznining the value of the ceded
area, they differ greatly not only in their ultimate opinions of value but
also as to the use of the market data materia . Mr. Saunderson, petitioner’s
appraiser, used the analyses of comparable sdes data, most of which sales
data is set forth in our findings of fact, as the przhnary approach to value.
Because of the limitations on available market data resulting from the remoteness of the valuation date, the absence of any sdes within the ceded area
prior to that date, and the absence of any large sales in the region prior to
the railroad land grant sales, this witness considered it necessary to use
sales of srriall areas of land within and nea by the ceded area, and also to
take into consideration sales for some years following the valuation date.

Mr. Saunderson was of the opinion that a study of these early sales showed

a definite rangeland value level and scale developed during the l8:‘§O‘s

and continued with but little change until around 1900. The early sales
of small l60-acre ranch claim pre-emptions, were important, he believed,
in the development of the general level and of the scale of rangeland
values and that the large-tract rangeland sales of the l880's and of the
l890‘s were important in fixing the scale and consistent with the early
small-tract sales on a rangeland capacity basis. Mr. .Saunderson testified
that he believed itipossnible to determine reasonably well the g_razing
capacity of the early sales of small selected lands as of the valuation date,
and to make an interpretation of their price on a grazing capacity basis
and then to related the values indicated to other types of land within the
area. The results of his interpretation of rangeland sales and the appli;
cation of the value level and scale to the rangeland types he estimated to
be found within the ceded area are shown in the table he prepared hereinabove set forth.

Defendant's appraiser on the other hand gave a consideration onl;v to
large-tract sales, mostly railroad sales, during the period l8-68-l903, as
a guide to his opinion of value. These sales he discounted at a rate of
87» interest back to the 1868 valuation date in order to determinetrhat the
buyers could have afforded to pay for the properties and carry them "‘e:,c3 {.11-’-:;r
date of the sales.

Little weight can be given in the valuation of an immense tract otf‘
3O,53O,761J~.8 acres to the consideration paid in the sales of a
of 160-—acre pre-emption claims within and nearby the ceded area. hese

small sales used by petitioner‘s appraiser, some 68 in number, 

\l'.‘

a total of about 11,000 acres, and in part but a 103?» random sampling
of early sales, were for the most part select locations in river valleys.
The land sales by the Northern Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads many
years after the 1868 cession are entitled to greater weight in determining
the value of the ceded area but due allowance must be made for the fact
that these sales followed construction of the railroads bringing transportation to the areas in which the sales were made and also followed
the ending of Indian hostilities and the destruction of the buffalo on
and near the ceded area. lt is apparent that land values would be f ar
greater after the occurrence of those three events than they were in 1868.
The appraiser for petitioner was of the opinion that his conclusion
as to value based on the market data ap_ r achwas corroborated by two
supplemental analyses. The first such supplemental study was based upon
what he said was the historical relationship between lmd values and live...
stock values in stock raising, which, according to the theory, indicate
that in the long run the land had a one-to-one value ratio to the live...
stock supported on it. The one-to-one ratio is not always constant
according to Mr. Saunderson, being closer at some periods than at others.
On cross-eicamination this witness admitted that the use of this formula
usually consists of three elements -- raw land 35 per cent, improvements

an
Such /approach to value regarding raw

l5;a, and range animal 50%.
lands, even if the correct formula was used and the ratio was constant,
would be theoretical and arbitrary if applied to a large area at a remote

ranch
time when there had been no long—run/operations in the region, few

sales of raw land, and open range operations in the region.

6 120

6 121.

Mr. Saunderson‘s second supplemental approach was based upon capital.ization of the probable rent which would have been yielded by the land of
a typical pioneering livestock operation. I‘-Er. Saunderson admitted that not
much, if any, of the ceded area could have been rented in the early years

following the cession (Tr. 328). The use of the capitalization method of
valuation under circumstances such as appear in this case is not a recog-nized method of valuation where there has been no rental income of the
property and especially where no such income could be expected in the foreseeable future._

The ceded area was adaptable in 1868 to several uses. The principal
one and the use most likely to be foreseen for the greater part of the
tract in the immediate .f.'utu_re was stock raising. Other uses to which parts
of the area were adaptable at that time were irrigated farming, timber
operations and nnnera development. Mr. Saunderson; petitioner's appraiser,
did not separately classify any of the lands within the tract as mineral
lands and did not add any specific value increment to those lands which
might have been desired for mineral development in 1868. Petitioner‘s
appraiser did appriase the timber lands of the ceded area, some i‘«,’;’t;f':L3,1.31.313
acres according to his estimate, at prices ranging from $ .50 to -f;3§2.jjf:O
per acre as of 1868 for their combined forestry and rangeland uses. 
witness stated in his report (Pet. E34. 209, pp. 48-49) that the 
of the timber" lands rested primarily upon the early stumpage value of the
stands, discounted for fire and other risk losses. On CI‘OSS-€Xc‘3.IT1i1‘.:§'1‘tTi.£333..
Mr. Saunderson testified that the sale of timber lands to the 
foot I-Eilling Compmy was "probably the most important thing“ t“

looked at and studied in appraising the timber lands. The sale thus re6 3.22

l89C and l90l, consisting of some l50,#32 acres in the Missoula and Flats
head drainages for $316,975.02, located appromrately l75 miles west of
the western border of the Crow ceded lands. The lands sold to the Company
were situated near the railroad.

The timber areas were substantially better than the timbered portions
of the ceded area but the range resources were not as good as the rangelands in the Crow timbered area, according to the witness. There is no
substantial.evidence that the timbered area of the ceded tract at the time
of the cession or for a long period thereafter was ever in demand except
for local use. The timber was predominantly lodgepole pine which for years
‘was to remain without commercial value. The timber of the ceded area'was‘
largely inaccessible at the time or the cession and for men‘ years therew
after until transportation became available to the various parts of the
ceded area. The sale of the timber lands to the Big Blackfoot Hilling_
Company, many'years after the cession following the construction.of the
railroad, and.many'miles distant from the ceded tract consisting of timber

substantially better than that on the ceded.lands, is hardly comparable.

Any increment to the value of the lands because of the presence of timber
as of the valuation date would be speculative and nominal.

Petitioner urges as one helpful guide in determining value in this
case the value set in prior decisions of the Court of Claims and.this
Commission in cases involving other Indian tribes. The lands involved in

those cases were parts of the subject tract or nearby areas. In Shoshone_

Tribe v. United States, 3 Ind. Cl. Comm. 313, the Commission determined

the value of 700,642 acres of land in the southwestern part of what had

_6 123

been the Crow ceded area to be at an average of $ .80 per acre in 1872 or
1874. The Court of Claims in Shoshone Tribe v. United States, 85 C. C13.
331, set a value of $1.35 per acre for 2,343,9£0 acres of the‘Wind River

Reservation as of 1878. This land was also part of the area ceded by the

Crow Tribe in 1868. In the case of the Assinboine Indian Tribe v. United

States, 77 C. Cls. 3&7, 372-3, the Court of Claims determined the value

of over 6,000,000 acres in northern Montana adjoining the northeast boundar?

of the Crow ceded area to be $.50 per acre, the valuation covering a range

of dates from.l868 to 1882. The Court of Claims in Fort Berthold Indians v.

 

United States, 71 C. Cls. 308, 338-300, allowed $ .50 per acre for

 

9,846,186.93 acres of land in eastern Montana and Eorth and South Dakota,
part or'which adjoined tne Grow ceded lands on the northeastern corner. The

dates of valuation range over a period of 1868 to 1880. In Blackfeet. et a1.

Nations v. United States, 81 C. Cls. 101, 132-136, the Court of Claims

determined the value of lS,26l,7h9.76 acres of land lying immediately north
of the Crow ceded area to be at the rate of $.50 per acre in 1874» 'Nhi1e
these valuation determinations are not controlling as far as the present
case is concerned, they are, of course, to be considered along a

record in the instant case. In considering these judicial valuations it it
also necessary to keep in mind the difference in valuation dates, 31¢ ska;
of the areas involved as compared to the Crow ceded area and the eoLj;1;:.n'
existing in 1868 as shown by the record herein.

The record discloses that as of 1868 the principal use to which the

tract was adaptable to a purchaser was that of stock raising 1:*C*i

hostilities, the roaming buffalo, the open range operation, and lack of
Because of its size the purchaser of the tract would

have known it would require selling off all or most of the ceded area in
smaller units which would have taken a long period of time, estimated at
30 to 35 years and that a large part of the tract, estimated at 2033, would
be unsaleable unless these lands were included with more desirable lands
in disposing of the large tract-to subsequent purchasers.

Taking into consideration the remote date of the cession, the enormous
size of the ceded area, the conditions then existing in and new the ceded
area, the lack of sufficient comparable sales or market data at and near
the date of the cession to indicate any actual market value for the tract,
and all 01' the evidence and testimony of record, the Commission conclu-:L..s
that as of May 7, 1868, the fair market value of the ceded area consisting
of 30,530,76l+.8 acres was $l2,2l2,305.00, or at the rate of 1&0 cents per

acre. The Commission further concludes that the consideration of

$1,611-?+,585.’+9 paid for t...-.e cession was unconscionable.
as to the consideration for the cessi«..n, T’;‘.l,6i&—"+, 585.159, the parties

agreed in their briefs that that amount was actually paid the Indians for
the cession of their lmds. Recently, however, and without questioning
that the above sum was paid for the lands, the petitioner, by amendment to
its proposed findings of fact, would have us take a reduced figure,
$l,lll,'?68.07, as the consideration, that is, the amount we should accept
as having been paid on the claim under the Treaty of May 7, l868.

The method by which the reduced figure is arrived at is best shown

by a statement contained i . the accountants‘ report which has been

submitted to the Commission. reads:

6 12.5

* * * * On the basis of an assuznption of an interest rate

of 53% simple interest per annum, and treating expenditures

as made on an average date in the fiscal year (December Bl),
the precise date of particular payments not being disclosed,
we find that the value of the future payments on May 7 , l868 ,
was $1,131,768.07’. That is to say, the sum of money which,
if put at 5% simnie interest on May 7, 1868, would have

amounted, with/in greet earned, to the entire $l,6’4-’+,585.LL9,

if disbursed in each of the fiscal years involved in the vary...

ing amounts expended (taking the same average date in each year)

would be $1,111,768.07. '
The figures used in the accountants‘ report were obtained from the G.A.O. ‘
report, Petitioner's Exhibit 23.1, which show disbursements under treaty
provisions extending from fiscal year 18,69 through fiscal year l932, a
period of 614- fiscal years. i

The difference between the amounts expended under the treaty for the _
cession, .i:‘.1.,6iH'+,5?35.i+9, and the reduced amount, $1,111,"/68.0’?, which the
petitioner now claims should be taken as the consideration for the cession,
is $532,817.42; this sum, as the accountants‘ computations show, is for
interest on the annual disbursements under the treaty from the date of
the treaty to each fiscal year in which the expenditures were made and
deducting such interest on each from each annual total. The same result would
be reached if the interest were added as part of the claim, but ;12::  
case it would be interest. In United States v. alcea Band 341, ‘i;ii.E.3. L58
1+9, the Supreme Court said: "* * * interest on claims against  
States cannot be recovered m the absence of an express provisfmoatig   
contrary in the relevant statute or contract." See also the case c:';7i,e;E.
in that opinion and Kiowa et al. v. United States, 5 Ind. Cl. Coz'z~;::.., 12?’?-i§>’?

 

312.

6 126

The Treaty of May '7, 1868, contains no provision p for payment of
interest on the deferred disbursements nor does the Indian Claims Commission Act provide for interest, hence, it follows the interest item
now claimed by petitioner must be denied.

Defendant's counsel in his brief urges that the petitioner is not
entitled to the fee value of the ceded lands on the basis that Indian
title does not include the ‘value of timber or subsurface rights but only
the use value. It is sufficient to point out that the Commission in its
prior decision in this case held that the Crow Tribe had recognized title
to the subject lands. In any event, this Commission has determined in

Coeur d‘Alene Tribe v. United States, our Docket No. 81, 6 Ind. Cl. Comm. l,

 

that Indian title imsludes full beneficial ownership of the value oi‘
timber and mineral rights." Defendant further contends that the consideration paid the Crows should include the 8,OOO,L&»O9.2 acres in the reser-.
vation which defendant urges was granted to the Crow Tribe by the l8-68
treaty. This reservation was part of the lands aboriginally possessed by

the Crow and recognized as such by the Treaty of Fort Laramie, in 1851.
