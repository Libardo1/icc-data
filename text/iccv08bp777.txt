The compromise provides that this case shall be so tled by the
entry, after all allowable deductions, credits and offsets, of a not
final judgment in the amount of $4,157,605.06 against the defendant
and in favor of the petitioner; that the difference between the amount.
awarded the petitioner in the interlocutory order and the amount allowed
in the compromise final judgment is $1110 ,000.00, an amount which represents the compromise settlement ‘of the offsets to be deducted. '

The proposed settlement of offsets also includes all offsets,
counterclaims, and payments on the claim, towhich the United States may
be entitled in the case of Charles E. Williams, Joseph Redthunder and
Harry Oahi, as representatives of the Nez Perce Tribe v. The United
States of America, Docket No. 180-A, as well as those to which the
United States would be entitled in the present case, Docket No. 175-A.
The purpose of including in this case of settlteza-ent of offsets in
Docket No. 180-A is to permit the entry without further proceedings
(‘determination of offsets. would bathe only matter left to determine) by the Commission of a final judgment in Docket No. 180-A at this time.
either party in-that case shall have the right to and may then promptly
appeal from the decision of the Commission in that case. lt was also
understood that while the parties hereto waive appeal or further lreriew

it

in Docket No. 175-A, there is no corresponding waiver of appeal made by

either party in Docket No. 180-11.

The steps and requirements which are generally to be taken in cases

of compromise settle-snents (see Omaha Tribe of 1\?sbra.sE-:.:t, et al, v. U.S-=

‘C-I--.$II1n-luv--I.-u-.---I-I‘.

 

8 Ind. Cl. Comzn. 739 p 779

8 Ind. C1. Comm. 392, hlé-hl9), have been followed in this present
proceeding. The findings fully set forth the steps taken which show
that the proposed settlement was carefully and fully presented to the
‘Indians of the petitioner tribe; and it was freel , voluntarily and
formally approved by the members of the tribe generally and by various
governing bodies through the passage of necessary resolutions. with
respect to the merits of the settlement 9: offsets against both dockets
for $lls.0,000.00, to be charged ‘only in Docket No. 175-A, we believe that
this sum is fair;gnder all the facts and circumstances in this case.

It was stated that the defendant had spent in the neighborhood of
$o00,000.00 for this tribe, a consideraule portion of which might I
ordinarily be chargeable as offsets, but in View of the lee with respect
to operation of forests for Indians and the charges that mght be paid _
defendant for such operation out of the proceeds of the operation, we
believe that the Government is not being unjustly dealt with in the
alloeance of $lh0,000.00 as full settlement of chargeable offsets it has
against this petitioner.

Important to this case, and to the petitioner and the Nez Perce

Tribe of Indians it represents, is our Finding No. 50, that the Ne:

- Perce Tribe of Indians, petitioner herein, represents in this matter

all of the Nez Perce Indians in Idaho, or Washington, or wherever
situated and that these Indians are, as described, entitled to the benefits

of the final judgment to be entered herein. is stated in the findinas
