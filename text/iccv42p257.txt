BEFORE THE INDIAN CLAIMS COMMISSION

THE SIOUX TRIBE, et al.,

Plaintiffs,

v. Docket No. 74

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

\-/\./\J\_I\.J\J\J\â€”/V-/

Defendant.

FINAL AWARD

This Commission has previously decided that the fair market value
of the lands obtained from the plaintiff Sioux by the United States under
the Treaty of April 29, 1868, 15 Stat. 635, was $45,685,000.00 This day
we have decided that the value of the Sioux interest in lands west of the
Missouri River was $23,054,700.00. Therefore, the total value of the Sioux
interests extinguished under the 1868 treaty was $43,949,700.00. This day
we have also decided that "no offsets, either payments on the claim or
gratuities, shall be deducted from the award in this case."

It appearing to the Commission that no further issues remain to be
resolved in this docket, the Commission is of the opinion that a final
award should be entered herein. It further appearing to the Comission
that the defendant did not pay any consideration for the interests in
land it obtained from the Sioux under the 1868 treaty, the Commission
concludes that the defendant is liable to the plaintiffs for the full

value of those interests.

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that plaintiffs shall have and recover the
sum of $43,949,700.00, as a final award in this docket.

Dated at Washington, D. C., this 19th day of July 1978.
