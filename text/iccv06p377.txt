FINDINGS" OF FACT

The Commission.makes the following findings of fact:

1. The petitioner, the Absentee Shawnee Tribe of Indians of Okla“ima, an organization recognized'by the Secretary of the Interior, has
the authority and capacity to maintain this claim under the provisions
of the Indian Claims Commission.Act.for and in behalf of the descendants
of the Shawnee Tribe or Nation (as it existed in 185k) as may be entitled
to participate in any recovery herein.

2° (3) The lands involved in this case were set apart_for the
Shawnee Indians by the United States pursuant to the Treaties of November 7,
1825: (7 Stat. 281;), and August 8, 1831 (7 Stat. 355). b

(b) The Shawnee tract, including the lands ceded and the lands
reserved, is located in what is now the eastern part of the State of
Kansas. The eastern boundary of the tract is the Missouri border. The

tract extends westward for approximately 120 miles to a line extending

southward from approximately the sitns of Fort Riley, Kansas, then existing

The Kansas River forms the northern boundary of the

2:‘ Kay 10, 1851.; (10 Stat. 1093), ratified by the Senate on August 2,
85b, and proclaimed by the President on November 2, 1851:. The lands

re described in the treaty of cession as follows:

Begilming at a point in the western boundary of the State

of Missouri, three miles south of where said boundary

crosses the mouth of Kansas River, thence continuing south
and coinciding with said boundary for twenty-five miles;
thence due west one hundred and twenty miles; thence due
north, until said line shall intersect the southern boundary
of the Kansas reservation; thence due east, coinciding with
the southern boundary of said reservation, to the termination
thereof; thence due north, coinciding with the eastern boundary of said reservation, to the southern shore of the Kansas

(c) The Shawnee tract contained l,60h,9S6 acres all of which ‘were
echnically ceded to the United States in the 1851; treaty. By the terms
i‘ said treaty, however, the United States re-ceded to the Shawnees an
rea which contained 200,166 acres, making a net cession to the United

33395 0-‘? the l;h0h,79O acres which are the subject of the controversy

Weill (Tr. 346). In conmction with the 200,166 acres of land re-ceded

iereinafter referred to as the "Shawnee Reservation“), with insignificant

cccpti ns, the Shaxmees were to choose parcels from that part of the

3. (a) while the setting aside of lands in Kansas for the Shannees
and other tribes had been made in contemplation that the lands would remain their permanent homes, there developed by the 1850's a strong demand
thai.Kansas be opened to white settlement. The rapid advance of settlement and the extension of the western boundary of the United States to
the Pacific Coast as a result of the annexation of'Texas in 18b5, the
establishing of title to the Oregon.Territory in l8h6 and the cession
by'Mexioo in l8h8 with the resulting passage of emigrants through the
Indian lands were two main factors responsible for the demand that the,
title to the Indian lands in Kansas and Nebraska be extinguished in whole
er in part.

(b) By'a provision of the.Act of Congress of'March 3, 1853

{Tie State 226, 238), the President of the United States was authorized

to negotiate with the Indian tribes west of the States of Missouri and
Iowa for the purpose of'“securing the assent of said tribes to the settleient of the citizens of the United States upon the lands claimed bf said
Indians, and for the purpose of extinguishing the title of said Indians

-n whole or in part to said lands; %'*'*3” Pursuant to that act, the
*resident designated the Commissioner of Indian.Affairs to conduct the
iecessary negotiations with the Indians and in the summer of 1853, the Comissioner (Mr. Manypenny) paid a preliminary visit to the Indian country
.n question for the purpose of exploring it and obtaining the information

.eceSsary to prepare full and detailed instructions as to the terms and

\JJ

\0

conditions of the treaties he had been directed to negotiate, On this
trip Cormissioner biangrpenny visited and held councils nith most of the
Indian tribes located immediately nest of Missouri and I ‘ea, including
the Shawnee Tribe, explaining to them the objects of his visit to their
country. In his Report for l8S3 to the Secretary of the Interior
(November 9, l8S3), in telling of his trip, Commissioner Manypenny stated
that the Shawnee, "as their only reply, proposed to sell the United
States one million of acres, reserving to themselves six hundred thousand (600,000) acres adjoining the State ofI=’1issouri. 4»? -3? ->-‘.’‘ Mr. Manypennyg further reported that he had found the tribes alarmed because whites
had gone over into the Indian country to explore it with the intention to
locate on it but that they had returned. The Commissioner stated with

- 4..
respect to the lands as had examined that:

The specific grants to different tribes west ‘of Missouri
and Iowa, (what is generally termed Nebraska,) are in tracts

thatcome up to the western boundaries of those States, and _ «run back west, a greater or less distance, for quantity.

These grants embody, no doubt, the best lands in the Indian
country. The quality of the soil, for the most part, is of

a very superior character, but portions of the lands are
entirely destitute of timber. A number of roads to New Mexico,
to California, and Oregon, pass through this country over these

lands, and are travelled by numerous bodies of emigrants every
year.

Mr. Manypenny did not conclude any treaties on his trip to said Indian ::re~.1ni:.r;j;"
in 1853 because those tribes willing to cede their lands desired to retain

portions of their reservations.

b. In the spring of 185).; the Shawnee tribal delegation commenced
negotiations with the Commissioner of Indian affairs in Washington, D. {3,,

involving the cession of the hawnee tract, The negotiations lasted over

.+.-35:" ‘

about a two-x-rec?-: period, The Commissioner at iirst wanted to have the
Shawnee cede all their lands. The Sha=;-mee offered to sell one million
acres to the nest, retain;’=.ng 600,000 acres bordering the tate of Missouri.
The Commissioner countered with three distinct propositions (1) $h08s750o00
for 1,000,000 acres, (2) $331,350.00 for l,}.~,50,000 acres, leaxring the
Shawnee 150,000 acres, and (3) $960,000.00 for all of their lands. The
payments proposed all called for a certain sunount to be invested at five
percent and the balance paid over a number of years. The delegates

thought the land, if they sold. it thenselves, would bring four million
dollars. The Commissioner stated they could "if they took the very best
land and "made that a standard for the rest, worthless and indifferent,
etc. 4? '3’: £3" The Commissioner stated he knew some of the lands were

“worth a good price--some oi‘ it for little or nothing like lands in other
‘ountries. 41- 4% $1». " The delegates countered with an offer to sell 1,200,000
acres of "the upper part of their land" for $1. 25' per acre. The Commissioner
next offered to sell their lands for them at public sale with the net

proceeds going to the Indians. This proposal the Indians later rejected

when again made by the Commissioner. The Commie sioner next offered to meet

the Indian‘s demand for a payment tobe included for trespass damage caused
by whites and to increase the area to be retained byi the tribe to 200,000
acres. The delegates informed the Commissioner they were willing to cede
l,hO0,000 acres, retaining 200,000 acres, but that they wanted one million
dollars as payment. This the Commissioner said he would not approve.
I-Eamrpenny in distinguishing between his first two propositions stressed

that he was offering about $103,000 for the 1,000,000 acres on the west and

1.

in the second proposition increased the offer 5..§3—:O3;05’0mOT€ OI‘ 51 'i'»Ow‘3~1
of 5;-I:83_,3SO if the 1403,00 acres on the east end were included in the
cession. It -.-cas this second proposition that finally was accepted by
the Indians with an additional $25,030.00 to be pa'd for trespass darrages
except the Indians rejected the plan of payment over a long period of time
and asked that payment be made in an eight-year period which was agreed

to by the Commissioner (Pet. Ex. 290}. Inlseekiné-.1 the edvice of the
Secretary of the Interior during the course of the negotiations the
Commissioner reported, “My proposition if reduced to a cash payment,

would be upwards of to cents, and theirs upwards of 50 cents per acre.“
.(?et. E. 291).

5. The Shawnee tract was favorably located in relation to accessibilitg‘. '..’.'i’.:; Kansas Ri‘v‘e.:£- -was ‘s.11ow-11 1.-pg 1353.; to be navigable in high water
for steamboats of light draft. This river afforded a major highway along
approximately the eastern half of the tract. Two major roads, the great
Santa. Fe Road and an important branch of the California Road, extended
through the tract from the northeast corner. The California road left the
tract near Topeka in Range 15 East and the Santa Fe Road extended southwest to Range 11 East where it dipped southward out of the tract. In
addition, there were nmnerous connecting roads and trails throughout the
eastern portion of the tract. In the western part there existed the Fort
Riley-Council Grove Road and the Fort Riley-One Hundredand Ten Road as 
as a branch of the Santa Fe Road leading northeastward toward Fort 
worth. There were no railroads in Kansas at the time but there was 

‘J

reason to believe a railroad would be built through the Shawnee tract 

5

the Kansas River or along the Santa Fe Trail or both but not for a
few years after 185k;

6. Differences exist between the eastern twomthirds, more or less,
and the western one-third, more or less, of the Shawnee tract. These
differences relate to certain geographical, topological, and historical
considerations, including the history of the salessnbsequent to the treau
ty ofg cession. Petitioner estimates 932,138 acres in the East Shawnee
lands and h72,652 acres in.the'west Shawnee lands. Defendant’s appraiser
figured the Western Shawnee lands at roughly 500,000 acres. The East
Shawnee lands belong, according to the United States Soil Conservation
study, to the subdivision called "the East Central Prairies Section" or
the “East Prairies and Interspersed'Woodlands Region.“ The western third
of the Shawnee tract belonged to two different subdivisions of the "Residn_l Prairie and Interspcrsed‘wocdlands“--the "Bluestem dills” ann.tne
‘Central Kansas Prairie“ regions. The Eastern Shawnee lamds are:moderately
rolling country with rock outcrops on the occasional low hills and on the
‘breaks and steep slopes along the drainage ways. Generally, the elevation
ranges from l200 to 1250 feet in the west to 800 feet in the east. The
Kansas River and its tributaries drain the northern portion, the Osage
River and its tributaries drain the central part of the Tract and the Neosho
and its tributaries drain the southwestern section. The common bedrock
consists of limestone, and shale, related to the loner*Permian and Pennsylvania geological period. The average rainfall of the Eastern Shawnee lands
?aHg3S frOm 35 to 39 inches from west toward the east, the average growing season ranges frnm l80 to 190 days, and the average annual temperature

ranges from fifty-five to fiftyaseven degrees. The western third of the

Shawnee tract is characterized by the "Limestone~Flint Hills"

section (which todagr is covered with BluE2S"f«€,"3 grass) predominantly in
the north and north:-rest and the “Cs-zntral xiansas Section“ of the "Central

Kansas Prairies Region.” The terrain of the latter is moothppto gently

rolling hi h strongly rolling to broken streanxbreaics. The elevation ranges
from l2OO to lSOO feet, the average rainfall is from 20 to 33 inches, growing
season averages l7O to 190 days, and annual average temperature ranges from
S1; to 58 degrees. The “Bluestem“ area had a more heavily rolling character with stream breaks; its predomina.nt elevation,'precipitation, growing
days average, and.temperature are about the same as the “Central Prairies
Section."

7, (2.) Several factors in valuing lands in the 1850's were uppermost in the consideration of those persons interested in dealing in lands
including bona fide purchasers, sellers, appraiser: and speculators.

Among the more important items to be considered were location, fertility

I

f the soil, timber and accessibility to transportation. In 1856, the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs in his instructions to the Commissioners
appointed to appraise the Indian Trust Lands in Kansas directed that:

In fixing a valuation you will regard the eligibility and

quality of the lands, the proximity of the same to the Missouri

or the Kansas River, or other water courses, to timber, to great
leading roads, or other advantages, and their position with reference to eligible town or City sites, and those all will be
taken into view and with any other causes which in your opinion
will add value to these lands, will be made an el_i_ment in fixing
the price per acre at which you will appraise them. They will be
appraised without any reference to the improvements which may have
been upon them but while these are left out of view, the i_mprove- '
ments which have been made upon adjacent lands other than trust
lands within the Territory of Kansas, so far as the same may add
value to the trust lands ,you should give -due weight thereto, and
allow this eliment of value to have its fair influence on your
judgment. 4:: =,'.»"-:;- §et., E.__~r;,., 2:37

{b} A study of the sett_enent. pattern up to 1851: in adjoining

;stern Piissouri showed that location and timber were two important
factors considered by the settlers on public lands, Timber and watercourses attracted the settler and large areas of open prairie were not
sought after. (Def. Ex. 1, pp. 109-120; p... lhl). This preference of

the settler is set forth also in £:.., T. !s.ndreas’,His’001"'.V Of the State

 

of Kansas, 1883 (Pet. Ex. llh) wherein it is stated in regard to the
early history of Morris County, which was partly 1-zithin the Shawnee
Tract on the extreme western end:

Each year brought its complement of settlers, and in
those days of trouble and uncertainty, each sought a location as near to the center of population as possible,
and as a consequence, the lands located along the Neosho
River were eagerly sought and readily taken. Two causes,
and, probably, a third, contributed to the desirability of

timber on either side of the stream; the second, the choice
and fertile soil of the valley; and the third, their proximity
to Council Grove, which, by this time, was a point of considerable importance as regards trade, and, also, as considered, in '
point of population. . . . . That some considered the scarcity of timber in Kansas as a drawback to settle 

ment is pointed out in A Journey Through Kansas, by C. B. Boynton and T. B.

Mason, published in 1855. Although the authors thought there was sufficient
timber ii‘ there was judicious management and other materials such as limestone and coal to substitute for timber, they wrote (Pet. 13:. 122):

The general impression seems to be that the deficiency of
timber is so great as to present a serious, if not insurmountable obstacle to the settlenent of the country, and
consequently each squatter has made it his first object to
secure a tract of timber both indispensible for his own farm, and
as a profitable investnent, frm the opinion that timber and
fuel must be both scarce and dear.

8. (a) Pursuant to the Act of Mat-oh 3, 1853, the United States
concluded seven treaties by which seven tribes ceded lands in Kansas to
the Government. In addition to the Shawnee treaty, treaties were made
with the Delaware (May 6, 21.8511, 10 Stat. 10348, II Kapp. 6111), the Iowa
(I~'iay 17, l8Sh, 10 Stat. IO69, II Kapp. 628), the Sac and Fox of Missouri
(May 18, 1851;, 10 stat. 1o7h, II Kapp. 631), the Kickapoo (Hay 18, 1851;,
10 stat. 1078, II Kapp. 63h), the Peoria (Hay 3o, 18st, 10 stat. 1082,
II Kapp. 636) and the Miami (June 5, 18st, 10 stat. 1093, II Kapp. 6&1).

(b) The Shawnee treaty provided for an outright cession to the
United States, as did three of the other seven treaties referred to. The
lands ceded thus became part of the public lands, subject to pre-emption
or other disposition under existing legislation. None of the public
land in Kansas was offered for sale priorto 1858 (Pet. Ex. 269).

(c) The remaining three of the seven treaties provided for cession
to the United States in trust, for sale for the benefit of the Iowa,

Delaware, and Peoria tribes respectivel .

(d) The Iowa trust lands comprised approximately 78,000 acres 

dling the eastern end of the Kansas~Nebraska border. The Peoria ‘true .1

4.

lands, immediately south of and contiguous to the Shawnee lands, were 
cated on the Missouri border, Including the reserved lands, it comprised

all of Iviiami County north oi‘ the Miami tract, and extended approximately

\..u
(:0
(ix

32 miles: x.*est of the iiissouri border. These t. est lands consisted of

_r1"OXl'1‘.‘.at-63.3’ 208,000 acres. The Delaware tr-est lands included substantial

parts of -eavem-zorth and Jefferson counties. On the east, one section

bordered the I-iissouri, and on the south, another section bordered on the

The trust

Kansas River. These lands comprised more than 560,000 acres.

lands were put on the market in 1856 and l8S7, after first being appraised.
9. The legislation-organizing the two territories of Kansas and
Nebraska, 10 Stat. 277, was enacted on 1~:ay'3o, 1851;. The Act of July 22,

1851:, lo Stat. 308, extended the provisions of the pre-emption law to

lands in Kansas and Nebraska which were ceded to the United States. (The

Plot was not intended to apply to the lands ceded by the Delaware, Peoria

and Iowa, which were not ceded to the United States, but rather were sold

by the TTn:‘+.ted -.Q_._?.'§‘_.c: The right oi'pre-£143;-ion

meant that the first settler on a quarter section or less of the public
:’

lands, acquired a priority right to the tract, and could acquire title
thereto at the minimum goternment price, $1.25 per acre, at any time prior
to the public sales. Settlement was authorized by statute in advance of
the public surveys. This right of the squatter or settler was referred to

as 9. "claim." In order to exercise his right, the settler would have ‘to

register his claim in a land registry "office and pay the $31.25 an acre
therefor. Claims were not legally assignable, but in°:{'act sales of claims

were commonly effected, and the goverrment permitted the assignees to exercise the claim rights which had been transferred to them.

10. (a) Large scale settlement of the ceded Indian lands followed

4.1....

on the heels of the treaties. The number of immigrants, predominantly

settlers, was followed by investors and speculators. A

Shawnee cession was settled soon after the t:=:-eaty  concluded, although
the lands were withheld from the market for a r:u;aher of years:

(b) 1n the East Shawnee area west of the 30—raile line, settlements
1-:ere quickly formed along the three leading arteries of travel and trade
through Kansas at that time. These were the Kansas River, the California
Road and the Santa Fe Road... The city of Lawrence was established in July
1851:, the city of Topeka in late 1851; and other towns located on the main
arteries or connecting roads within the Shawnee cession were quickly located such as Tecumseh, Lecompton, Burlingame, Palmyra and Franklin.

(c) East of the 30-mile line, settlement was hinderedby the fact
that this was the Shawnee Reserve area in which most of the Indian selections were to be located within 90 days after approval of the surveys.

(Pet. Ex. 21). Many did not wait but squatted 6;; the lands and’ took timber
(Pet. Etc. 26). Host of the land not selected by the Shawnee Indians was i
occupied by white settlers by February 185'? (Pet. '2'-ix. 79).

(d) The West Shawnee lands were not settled as rapidly. Max Greene,

'*~’Ti’°5-DES in The Kansas Region, published in 1856, wrote "all the country I-rest

 

of the Wakaroosa settlement, and south of the Kansas River is open to whoevermay choose to pitch his tent there" (Pet. E. 1110). The West "" 
land?» (Ranges 6-ll) sold slowly. In 1859, 5.14% had been sold, in 18605,
705533 in 1861, 8%; in 1862, 15.5%, and by 1869, Lois.

(10 State 308), settlers could and did preempt the lands prior to pub‘: jg:

sale for the minimum price of $1.25 per acre. More than 8 per cent of
these lands had been preempted by the end of 1857, 81.2% bF'%h6 63¢ 05
1858, 86c3% by the end of 1859 and more than ninety per cent of the lands
had sold by the end of 1860.

(f) Public sales of the land east of the Boemile line, in which area
most of the Indian selections were located, were delayed until 1863. By‘
the end of 1858, however, 62.hl per cent of the acreage ceded had been
preempted; 80.89 per cent by the end of 1859; and 85.78 per cent by the

end of 1862. Less than 15 per cent of the acreage remained available

.to be sold in 1863, or later, or to be taken up without payment under the

Homestead Act of'May 20, 1862 (12 Stat. 392).
(g) Taking the Shawnee Tract as a whole 5.5% of the land had been
ld or preempted by 1857, 33.6% by 1858, 6o.h% by 1859, 68.2% by 1860,
68.7% by 1861, 67.33% by 1862, 67.7% by 1863, and byél869 the figure was _
77.h%. Commencing in 1863, settlement under the Homestead Act is included.
11. Neither party to this cause of action has introduced evidence
of private sales at or prior to the date of valuation. Petitioner based
its valuation of the ceded lands on the market data supplied by the sales
of the Delaware Trust Lands to the north of the Shawnee Tract and the
Peoria Trust Lands to the south of the Shawnee lands which sales occurred
subsequent to the cession of the Shawnee Tract. Defendant‘s sales consisted
of only Government sales of small tracts in adjoining Missouri up to the
date of the cession, the record and pattern of which sales defendant urged
as the most direct factor in the valuation of the Shawnee Tract.

12. (a) "Under the instructions given to the appraisers for the

laware and Peoria Trust Lands (Finding 7 (a)) the appraisals were started

V1.

in April l8 (3 and completed by November   other instructions
the appraisers were directed that if they were of the opinion that any
portion of the lands were worth less than $1.25 per acre, they were not
to place any value on such lands.

(b) The first class lands inrthe Peoria Trust area were appraised
at values ranging from $1.50 to $2.00 per acre; second class lands at
values from $1. 25 to $2.00 per acre; and third class lands at’ $1.25’ per
acre.

(C) Under instructions as to the DelawareTrust lands, the eastern
part of the tract was appraised first. For the 68338171 lands the first
class lands were appraised at values ranging from $1.50 to $h.00 per acre;
second class lands from $1.25 to $3.00 per acre; third class lands fzwn
$1. 25 to $32.00 per acre. In the western lands of the Delaware Tract, first
class lands were valued from $1.50 to $h.00 per acre, second class lands;
from $135’ '00 $14.50 per acre and third class lands from $1.25 to $1.75
per acre. I

(d) The final appraisals above of the Peoria and Western Delaware
Trust lards had been increased following a communication from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs that the original appraisals of the Iowa, Peoria
and western Delaware Trust Lands were not satisfactory to the President,

The Commissioner suggested that:

From the evidence of the value of that country as disclosed at

the recent sale of the Eastern portion of the Delaware lands it
is believed that you will readily see the necessity of increasing the rates at which you have appraised the first named lands.

.!‘-,s a result of these instructions, the Peoria trust land valuations were

increased by the appraisers an even 25 cents per acre in each classif: t o

ad for the western Dela‘.-rare trust lands, the appraisals were increased
in some cases by 25 cents per acre and in others by 50 cents per acre.
The final appraisal of the Peoria lands showed an average value of $1.66
per acre.: The final appraisal of the Peoria lands showed an average value

of $3

l.66 per acre for the 208,585.69 acres appraised. The final appraisal
for the eastern Delaware lands showed an average value of $1.796 for the
2l7,5l5.5Lt acres appraised. For the western Delaware trust lands the
final appraisal showed an average value of $1.655 for the 3h3,326.36
acres appraised.

13. The Peoria Trust lands sold during the period June 25, 1857,

and 51113’ 111, 1857. with the exception of 700 acres withheld a total of

207,758.85 acres were sold for the sun of $3h6:_.67l-09: an average of
$1.67 per acre. Total receipts from the sale of the Delaware Trust Lands
mounted to $l,O5h,9h3.7l, an average price (based on 560,8I.=.l.9O acres)

Of $91. 88 per acre. The fact that the average sales price per acre of

these two tracts was only slightly higher than the average appraised
value is not indicative of what the lands would have brought on the open

market in many instances. The lands of the Delaware and Peoria Tracts

were mostly all claimed by settlers and speculators prior to appraisal and

sale. “Claim associations" were formed by the settlers to protect their

claims. For bona fide settlers who had made "lasting and valuable imprcv em°'nt3" the appraisals were to be considered the fair value of the land.
Many of the so-called bona fide settlers were but speculators who obtamed

their lands at the appraised value.

Treaty of May 10, 1851;, on August 2, l85h, there was strong demand for

 opening of.‘ the Shawnee Tract for settlement  whites. The .SLh.-zawnee
Tract was favorably located as far as the eastern Shawnee lands were concerned to the Kansas and Missouri rivers, and to great roads such as the
Santa Fe Trail and a branch of the Califosrniauiioad. The eastern Sholmee
lands were favorably located with respect to the relatively highly settled
areas in the State of Missouri adjoining these lands to the east and their
markets. There we-rea number of excellent townsite locations within the
Eastern Shawnee lands. The servicing of these lands by a railroad or railroads in the near future was virtually a certainty. The East Shawnee lands
were fertile and for the most part highly favorable for general farming in
small tracts. The climate was favorable for agricultural production and

the area was wel watered. In l8S34, till: er was animportant factor in
vduing lands and within the Shawnee Tract this commodity was scarce

except along the water courses. In l85h, while it was evident that there would be a strong demand for the choice Eastern Shawnee lands with timber,
the prairie lands would have been considered far less valuable. The fact
that the Shawnee Indians were to make their selections from the lands within the 30-mile limit adjoining the State of Missouri and close to the centers
of population and markets and would undoubtedly select the choice lands with
timber (which they did) would influence the purchase price for the remainder‘
of the tract. While the millions of acres of Government prairie land in ti”-be
State of Missouri still open for settlement would have little effect upon
the demand for choice lands with timber in Kansas, the availability 01'.‘

these Government lands would reflect upon the value and demand for prairie

lands within the Shawnee Tract.

I

lS. The highest and best use of the western portion of the Shawnee‘

Tract in 1853,: would have been general farming coupled with extensive
grazing of livestock (see Pet. Ex. 151; Def. 125:, 3., pp. 23-30, 97-99%
The -grazing lands are part of the Bluestezn region providing excelJ.ent
pasturage. The Western Shawnee lands as of 18511 were not considered
nearly as valuable as the Eastern Sfhawnee lands especially those close
to the State of Missouri. This is evident from the treatment of these
lands in the discussions between the Shawnee delegates and the Conniesioner at the negotiations leading up to the treaty of cession (Fdg, 14);

The Western Shawnee lands were less desirable with respect to location,

transportation, timber, soil and proximity to improved settlements.

16. The consideration for the cession is stated in Article 3 of the

Treaty of May 10, 18514, 10 Stat. 1053, which reads as follows:

In consideration of the cession and sale herein made, the
United States agree to pay to the Shawnee people, the sum of
eight hundred and twenty-nine thousand dollars, in manner as
follows, viz: Forty thousand dollars to be invested by the
United. States, at a rate of interest not less than five per
centum per annum, which, as it accrues, is to be applied to
the purposes of education; 4% 6% 4'. Seven hundred thousand
dollars, to be paid in seven equal annual installments, during
the month of October of each year, commencing with the year one
thousand eight hundred and fifty-four; and the residue of
eighty-nine‘ thousand dollars, to be paid within the same month
of the year, after the termination of that period.

It is admitted by the pleadings, and the brief of petitioner, that the

defendant paid the petitioner the sum of $829,000 in accordance with the

provisions of said Article 3.

17. By express provisions of Article 17 of the Treaty of May 10, l8S)_L,

it became obligatory on the parties upon ratification of the Senate and,

as stated in Finding 2(b), it was ratified by the Senate on August 2, 18534,

and became ef3I‘e-ctivc, as of that d-te.
l8. The Commission finds that the eastern portion of tho Shawgnee

Tract conszieting oi‘ 932,138 acres had a fair market are ue as of august 2,

.(../9'

185b, of $3l,63l,2hl.C-O, or at the rate of ?.l¢.75 per acre: The Co::1mission
further finds that the western portion of the Shawnee Tract consisting
Of’ 1472,5252 acres had a fair market value as of August 2, 18594, of

$307,223.00’ or at the rate of siscty-five cents per acre. The fair

‘market vadlne of the whole Shawnee Tract consisting oi‘ l,1:Ols,,79O acres

as of August 2, 18511, was $l,938,b6] .00. The consideration of $829,00Q.=OO
paid to the Shawnee Indians under the provisions of the Treaty of May 10,

18514, for the cession of lands having a value of $§l,938,h6h.0O was unna éE~O.r-an I"\_"\/‘ f'\"‘.

cornscionable. The petitioner is charger-d+>].e with the 9::

the consideration received, leaving a ‘oalance payable to petitioner of

$l,l09,h6h.OO, from which will be deducted the offsets, if any, to be

hereinafter determined in’ accordance with the Rules of the Commission.
