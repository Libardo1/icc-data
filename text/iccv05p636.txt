AHENDED AND SUPPIEEE§TAI.FINDIHGS OF FACT

 

Upon the evidence received in this Docket since the Amended Findings of Fact and Interlocutory'0rder of this Commission were entered

on no-.-a-.be: 23, 1953, the Commission finds that its Finding of Fact Ho.
28 sh uld be and is hereby superseded and made to read as hereinafter
appears; that its Finding of Fact N . l9 should be and is hereby superseded by our Findings hereinafter made insofar as it sets out or refers
to the actual acreage contained within any part of Tract C, said Finding of Fact No. 19 to remain in full force in all other respects.

The Commission also makes additional Findings of Fact which are supplemental to its Findings Nos. 1 to 28, as amended:

28. After passage of the Act of December 2l, l90h, 33 Stat. 595,

lpreviouslp'referred to and before the Pecore Survey officially:marked

the western boundary of the Yakima reservation along the su:nitLo£’

the Cascade Kountains, the Horthern Pacific Railwav Company filed minU

eral indernity selection claims to 3L6.Aa acres of land in Section.9,

K-J

(_I\

Township ll North, Range 12 East, belonging to petitioners an lying
in the area between the summit of the Cascade Mountains and Spencer's
Point (Goat Butte). The Company released said claims on March 28,
l9hl, and on May 21, l9n2, the selections were formally cancelled of
record by the General land Office. No patents were ever issued, and
said tracts remain unoccupied reserved land within the boundaries of
the Yakima Indian Reservation. (Def. Exs. 58,59) There being no
showing that possession is withheld from.petitioners or that Indian
title has been.extinguished, petitioners are not entitled to recover‘
from.defendant for a wrongful taking of these lands.

29. The south fork of Ahtanum.Creek rises in_the northern part
of Section l8 in Township ll Eorth, Range 14 East of the Willamette
Meridian and flows thence north into Section 7 and fnon.there northeast and east through Sections 8, 5,4 and 3 to its junction with R8servation Creek in Section 2. Said stream.is one link wide at the
section line between Sections 18 and 7, fifteen links wide at the
boundaries between Sections 7 and 8, and 8 and 5, and eighteen links
wide at the section line between Sections 5 and A. In Section 4, approximately three miles from its source, it receives a tributary
strean.rising in Section 5, which is one link wide at the line between Sections 5 and A, and less ‘thancne :::Z.'*.!.e in length. This latter
tributary rises at a spring near a pbint called Vessie Corral.
(Def. Exs. 50 to 56, inclusive, 2 and L).

The use of township plats which are based upon the original

notes of official surveys filed in the office of the United States

Surveyor General, and which bear notations of acceptance and approval by that official, is more accurate than the use of maps prepared
by the Geological Survey, Department of the Interior, prior to an actual survey of the area mapped, both as to acreage computations and
topographic representations. Planineter readings of photostatic copies of such maps with compensating allowance for shrinkage in photostating are accepted as good.surveying practices, and such acreage
measurements are considered within one-tenth of one degree accurate.
(Trans . p. l21.z.—l!-+7).

30. According to actual surveys, supplemented where necessary

by pla-imeter readings from township plats which are based upon

.3

field notes of official governmental surveys, particularly where
reservation boundaries transverse section lines, the acreage between the south fork of Ahtanun.Creek and Reservation Creek, east of
the line suggested by E. C. Barnard in 1900 as the true boundary of
the Yakima Indian.Reservation on the north, is 2,930.77 acres; th*t
part of the reservation lying south of the crest of the divide exe
tending by way of Darling Mountain from Reservation Creek westward
around the head of the Klickitat River to 3pencer=s Point, and north
of the Campbell-Gernond-Long survey ine m-ich runs between Reservation Creek and Spencer‘s Point, contains 15,163.65 acres. There is
a total of l8,0?A.&2 acres within the area designated as Tract C, as
so bounded. Of this acreage £25.32 acres have never been patented.

western end of Yakima County. A ranrre running eastward along the
Yaki::1a-Klickitat county line is known as the Sinzcoe I-Eountain P"n:,e.
The Yalkina Indian Reservation lies bet:-ree the suzrmit of the Gascade Mountains on the west and the ‘Yakima River on the east, a distance of approximately 80 miles. The western portion is mountainous timberland, and the eastern portion lower rolling agricultural

lands. The southern boundary line runs southeast from Mount Adams

to a depth of t. ree miles into Klickitat County, and then turns

-eaS'°W3-3-"d- The 27,647.71 acres known as the Cedar Valley Tracts

are located within a twenty-mile square area in ‘he souti-“.'.r..st cor-a--n»:.—'..-'' of this reservation within Tornships-. 6,’7,8,and 9, Ranges l2, l3,
11+ and 15. Approycinatelzf 15,300 acres of such tracts form an 7most solid block in Klickitat County. Those within Yakima County
aremore scattered, but all tracts lie in the mountainous area between the Sizncoe Ridge on the s uth and the Toppenish Ridge on the
north, and an are sufficiently con.pact to be considered a logging
unit for mass operation.

The Cedar Valley Tracts are some l2 r:::.1.les south and distinctly separated from Tract C, x-fnich lies about the headwaters of the

32. This section of Washington immediately east of the Cascade
Mountains did not come within the influence of the white man‘s civilization until after the Yakima cession of l855, and the establishment
of Fort Simcoe within the boundaries of the newly created Yakima Reservation. Settlers were quickly attracted to the level and rolling’
Valle? land along the Yakima River. The fertile soil and early intT0duC3i0n 0? irrigation in that area led to its rapid denelcpnent
and settl ment before interest developed in.the rugged lands imne4~
ciately east of the Cascade Range, which until passage of the Act of
December 2l,l9OA, were treated as part of the public domain. The
first settlement within Yakima County occurred in Moxie Valley during l860, fire years before the County was organized by the washington Territérial g vernment, four years before Klickitat County'was
organized. By 1870 there were 432 persons residing within.Yd§tna
and Kittitas Counties. Yakima County’s population reached l3,h52'by
l900, Ll,709 by l9lO and 77,h02 by 1930. Yakima City had lh,802 residents in l9lO and 22,101 by l930. Klickitat County settled more
slowly; The first settlement was made in l859 near Goldendale. By

33. The forests of our country were cnnsidered a liability by
the early piéneers who were usuaJ ly rlnterested in clearing the land
for agricultural use. However, as the available supply of timber a-bout thesettlements became limited, there developed a recognition

of timber values apart from the land, and speculative investment buying began to exceed purchases for irmediate logging operations. Interest shifted frcm. the N  England states to the forests about the

Great lakes and then to the south where the bulk of the marketed lumber
was produced from 1890 to about 1920. Active investment or speculative

‘interest developed in the nortlr.-restern forests around 1890 although the

S R

coastal regions produced lumber :.or Europe and the c‘~'a_'-:7.-ed’-*':..".-.l trade much

\

earlier. Iot only did the trees grove’ dO's°."I1 to the water's edge, but th
skidding of logs down the western slopes oi‘ the Cascades was comparatively easy, and the stand was rersarkably heavy, the evergreen forests
ranging between 25,000 to 50,000 board feet per acre. (Def. Ex. 5.9.0

pp. 53-58)

Commercial lu.-*$ering cormenced much later within the region east
of the Cascades, both because the timber '.-:as not so readilyiaccessible
and because the stand was much lighter. However some of.‘ the best pine

stands within the state of Washir-eton are found 1.-::'-.tI::in Yakima and K_'Lic1:itat Counties. Roughly one-third of "“’-c.'E.='aa County is tirsr-.berlan.d, of

which Lh'7,000 acres are within the Yal<:i:::a Indian Reservation, and Klic‘.—citat County has 539,000 acres in timber. The stand within Cedar Valley

3,000 board feet of Ponderosa pine to the acre, and destroyed other trees

in corresponding n~nber. In l90h the stand approximated 13,000 board

feet per acre of Ponderosa pine and 3,000 board feet per acre of other mixed species. (Herion,i&ans. 8-9, Hense, Trans. 2A-27)
3h. lumbering operations within Yakima and Klickitat Counties

developed slowly. Only 23 square miles Hithin.the whole of Klickitat
County was logged by l900. There were no large operations unti_ the
‘Western Pine lumber Company (which was acquired in 1922 by the J.
Neils lumber Company) built the Klicnitat Hills at Klickitat (later
Lyle) on the lower Klickitat Rirer in 1909. (Def. Ex. 49, p. 3&3. Until as late as l926 all t'nberland sales in the County were confin4‘ 4'! auto 4---II:-nun an and» -- ':-—u- ab 4-0 --—-II- F ‘*1 "‘

feet with occasional peaks of 5,000 feet and the valleys occasionally

, drop below 3,000 feet. It is d::'e_'I.ned. by the Klidcitat River and its

branches. The streams are rapid and small. with the exception of
the Columbia River which bounds Klickitat County on the south and is
from 30 to 35 Iniles south of the Yakima Reservation, none of the
streams in Yakima or Klickitat Counties is navigable, nor may they
be used for “driving” logs (Def . Ex 49,333. l8-2l; 'I‘rans.pp. l9l--2).
There is a plateau about the town of Lucas, the surface of which is
cut by small streams. Snow lies upon the ground more than half the
Fear (Trans. p. 181+).

(b) The soil is classified by the Soil Conservation Service as
Class 6, 7, and 8; that is, ranging fro: soil suitable for grazing
and forestry to that suitable only for wild life, recreational or
watershed purposes. Precipitation is light; the growing season lasts
about three months, with frostsuntil mid-June. The forage is chiefly pine grass which has little nutritional value; bunch grass with
scattered patches of peavine along the watercourses; weeds and sunflowers. Cattle and sheep are grazed between June lst and September 30th, but nust be winterfed or rezioved during the winter season.
The soil is heavily impregnated with pine resin and will not produce for the first seven years after being cleared.. (Def. E‘/..s. #9,
Q3. 23, 35-1+3, 60, 65-7; Trans. ga. 66, 91-2, 171).

(c). Cedar Valley has no mineral deposits and there is no evidence of any scenic, wild life or recreational values to affect its
fair market value as of Decerzber 2l, l?C*Z-.‘.

36(a) Cedar Valley was first settled by a group of Baptists who

arrived about 882;. They established the town of Lucas. .5. f  years

ac . .
later abo;$ forty Polish families settled near Vessey Sprirvs. This

I
town was disenntinned between 1900 and 1910. in 1900 the census within the valley was 76 and it was estim ted at 100 in 1902. Population
was most dense between then and 1905; but had dwindled by 50% before
1910, and when the patented lands were acquired by the Vernon Parrish

Lumber Company in 1925-6 there were only a few settlers living w thin

the entire valley.

_ 37(a). In 1904 there were a few short, interlacing dirt roads
within Cedar Va11ey'but the sole means of ingress or egress was over
the old dirt military road to Fort Simcoe which had been constructed
in 1855-1356, to service Fort Simcoe, and all supplies moving in Yakima COL‘..n'ij;' passed over it until 1881;, This road; e=e':«.'i'.s-.r'1d.'31"'.g ‘F2-‘.".‘?':". T???

Sincoe Range and through Cedar Valley eventually reached Yakima. It
was unimproved until 1909.

The military road also serviced northern Klickitat County but
heavy snows in the Sincoe range blocked passage during the sinter
season and shortly after its construction it was supplemented in
Yakima County by a second dirt road which passed around the eastern
end of the Simcoe range;

The residents of Csteaar Valley found that 2,000 to 3, soc pounds
was a good load for a four-horse team upon these roads. t was a

(b) In 190a there were no railroads within Cedar Valley. The
Northern Pacific Railway Company had constructed a tract in 188a from
The Dalles through the extreme eastern end of the Yakima Indian Reservetion to Toppenish, and Yakima, which was the first link between this

%general area and the Pacific coast. This tract was later extended northwest across the Cascade Eountains to Seattle, passing several miles northeast of Tract C. A tract of the Columbia River and Northern Railroad
Company was built in 1903, from Lyle on the Columbia River to Goldendale, terminating 13 miles south of the Yakima Reservation.and Cedar

Valley. In 1909 this line was connected nith a line extending to the

vPacific coast.

Trans.;p. 181-A; Pet. Ex. 91 (37)).

38. Telephone and telegraph lines followed the Northern Pacific
Railway along the eastern end of the akima Reservation and up the

9

valley of the Yakima River. Neither service was available'within
Cedar Valley in 190A (Pet. Ex. 52, p.ha). ‘

39. Earl? settlers in Cedar Valley *ttenpted to clear and cultivate the land, and remains of their irrigation projects are yet_visible.
Their efforts were unsuccessful due to poor soil, a short growing season and severe winters. Only a few head of livestock were raised for

'want of winter feed. Seven.sa":i_ls were built at various points with. 1%; I:- -D-I-II-1.‘ 4- " - . .-a:-- ......,., . ‘

ever in operation at one time, and practically all the lumber was
used locally. However, the settlers were attracted by the timber
and streams, and did explore the possibility of commercial lumbering. They tell of four day hauls to The Dalles where they received
$12.50 per thousand for A Ro. l clear pine which sold at the mill
in Cedar Valley for $2.50 per thousand; of four day trips to White
Swan with a four-horse team.hauling 3,500 board feet, and after l9l0

some logs were taken to the mills at Glenwood. (Trans. 183). ‘While

prevailing prices for Ponderosa pine from l9OO to l9lO ranged from

?8.00 to $12.00 per thousand elsewhere, lumber was traded by Cedar

Valley residents for an~.hing available which their.families could

use (Trans. p. 85). _ i

These settlers acquired their land under the general land laws
applicable to the public domain. Entries upon 78 tracts in Cedar
Valley were made under the Timber_and Stone Act of 1878, 20 Stat.
89, and there were 100 entries under the Homestead Act of.Hay 20,
1862, 12 Stat. 392, and.ar;n;nenta. Under these acts minimun.prices
varied from $1.25 to $2.50 per acre for cash entries, or negligible
filing fees upon showing of five *e*rs' residence and other qualifications, all for tracts of not to exceed l6O acres per person. The
record does not disclose the exact cost to the settlers of the patented lands. One tract was patented to the State of'Hashington.un5

$3.l25 to $12.50 per acre for eight of the tracts, which amou.tcd
to no more than replacement cost of the improvements upon them.
(Trans. p.66‘. Two of he sales conveved tracts with sawmills upon
them and the mills passed with the land. One settler, Ben Knox,
stated when leaving the Valley in 1902 he could have acquired 320
acres of the finest timberland there for $1.00 per acre, but decided against the investrent. (Def. Ex. #7; D. 65).

(b) The Vernon Parrish lumber Company acquired the patented
tracts as an investment, the bulk of the purchases being made in

1925 and 1926. Although the deeds recite a consideration of $1.00

pper acre, the prices varied according to the improvements upon each i

tract, and the consideration was never more than equal to the valne

‘N

‘of the improvements (Trans.pp. 90-167).

This purchaser nade no attempt to log the land and during l9A6
all tracts were sold by the liquidator of that company to the J.
Neils lumber Company which had previously acquired stumpage on the
intermingled tribal lands. Having spent "hundreds of thousands” of
dollars constructing access highways to Guler, across Klickitat Canyon, and feeder roads throughout the ar a, logging operations were
commenced by the J. Neils lumber Company in 1952. ?hey are moving
the logs to Guler by Deisel—powered trucks and fnom there by rail to
their mills at Klickitat.

(b) A study of over 300 sales by individuals of timberland in
Klickitat County, in Township 6, Ranges l2 and l3, was made by defendant‘s expert witness C. Kare Eiller, who testified that the first sale
in this township occurred in l892. Between then and l90h, 9,Ai9 acres
exchanged hands at an average price of $L.O8. Following construction
of the railroad to Goldendale, and between l904 and l909, inclusive,

Q/'

l9,9A2 acres were sold for an average price of oo.37 per acre. After

a railroad line was constructed along the north bank of the Columbia
River in 1909 and provided passage to the coast by rail, and between
then and l9l6, inclusive, ll,ll3 acres were sold at an average price

of 39.0h per acre. The average consideration increased to $15.39 per

‘acre, during the period from l9l?—l92£, inclusive.

Hr. Killer considered these lrnds'were comparable in quality
to the Cedar Valley tracts, and as close to that area as possible,
although they'were more readily accessible to a railroad and at a
lower altitude and hence easier to log. While most of these sales

‘were in tracts of less than 4,000 acres, they included several resales of considerable areas. Twentv—ei9ht thousand acres were acQ

quired by the Klickitat Ehite Pine Connany between 1902 and l9l9 and
sold to the Eastern and Western Pine Company during l9l9; and between 1906 and l92O the Hershey lumber Company acquired some L,O0O
acres which it sold in l92O to the Eastern and hestcrn Pine Company
(Trans. 82~5; Trans.ll&; Def. 33.

south of Cedar

\J1

Valley, in Townships g and 5, Ranges 12 and 13, within what he termed

was "a reasonable distance from.our mill at Klickitat, Washington." He

said:

We were not interested at all in timber lands located in the
(Yakima) Reservation or in that vicinity, and would have no
idea as to the value of these lands at the time we were buy»
ing timber for the Klickitat Hill. In fact, I do not believe
the lands had any value at that t'me as there were simply no
purchasers. "

As I told you over the phone, we were paying about $15.00 per
acre for lands which contained a good stand of timber, and
this price did not seem to vary to anv ereat extent until long
after the J. Heils lumber Company acquired our properties.
(1922). later on the Rails Company started to acouire timber
further Earth, and the land in Townships 7 and 8 started to
have a value in spite of its isolated location.

Hr. Holmes continued his remarks concerning timberlands and their
value, commenting that $15.00 per acre was not a high price to pay for
land within.a reasonable distance of a mill in l909 to l922; that he
had no idea shat price a purchaser would have paid for isolated land.
such as the reservation area'between l884 and 1918; that he believed
its value was solely as an investment for a purchaser willing to buy a

considerable acreage in a more or less solid block, pay annual taxes and

hold it for a future profit. He said there was good demand for Ponderosa pine lumber in l909; thct timber prices in Kliekitat and Yakima
counties did not.seen to show any'narked improvement until after 1935.

That lands and timber upon them were recognized as having separate worth is evident from the act of December 2l, 190a, which directed the sale of tidber upon.some of the Ya.ina Reservation; however, no
stuzpage sales were made in this particular area until l9l3.

ho stunpage sales occurred within Klickitat or Yakima
Counties prior to 1913. However, stmpage on the Yakima Reservation, including lands about the Cedar Valley tracts, was apprais'ed by the appraisal Commission of the Yakima Indian Reservation

during 1910. The values fixed by this Commission ranged from.50¢
to $2.25 per thousand board feet for both the Ponderosa pine and
other species, depending upon the stand and quality of the timber.
In his publication “Indian Forest and Range,"Er, J. P, Kinney3'who
was then the Assistant Forester in the Indian.Forestry Division,
Department of the Interior, said he was present on the lakina
Reservation that year, and had been instrumental in delaying a.

proposed sale of timber upon the reservation lands because he felt

it was then impossible for the Indian to realize more than $2.00

per thousand board feet for Pondcrosa pine and possibli 50¢ per

thousand boar feet for other species (Pet. Er . 84,95; Def. Ext 68).

His valuation has substantiation in the Commissioner of India.

per thousand, located upon land immediately adjacent to the line of

.....l--&gthe Rorthern Pacific Railway Company between Yakima and Seattle. Mr.

'0

hiller’s investigation into this purchase disclosed that the area in'volved was grazing land with stringers of timber running along the
water streams (Trans. p. 96). The Company later attempted to establish
a l9l3 valuation of $2.00 per acre upon its standing timber in Kittitas

stands of Western Pine timber there is anywhere in the Inland
Empire or in the entire west. All cruisers who have worked
in our timber have pronounced it to be equal if not superior
to any other Western Pine in which they had ever worked, as
to quality, size and length of body.
The location of our timber is of course exceptionally favorable as it is adjacent to the Kittitas and Yakima valleys
which constitute one of the richest agricultural districts
in America and which assures a very large local market at

times. acccrdincly we feel jusufied in claiming from
a comparative standpoint that our timber should be valued

Y

at as much if not more than any other body of destern Pine.

Er. David T. Eason, senior partner of the firm.of Eason, Bruce
and Girard of Portland, Oregon, then Chief of the Timber Section of
the B‘ can of Internal Revenue, and responsible for theassessment, fix»
ed the value of this timber as of l°l3 at $1.75 per thousand board feet.
This stand was a part of the timber of the Cascade lumber Company located about 5CJmiles northeast of Cedar Val ey and readily accessible to

a railroad (Def. Ex. 60; Pet. Ex. 83; Trans. p. 57.).

A3. As Logging Manager for the J. Neils lumber Company who are
now logging this area, Mr. George Allen Herion prepared an Outline of
Procedure for that company in 1946. with the mechanical and motorized facilities then available, Mr. Herion's estimate allows slightly
more than 28% of the tinber raluation for cost of production of lumber,
including therein, however, 12% for profit and risk, and reciting that
to log the region.miles of railroad track and logging roads would need
be bui t, and a bridge constructed across the Klickitat River. (Pet.
Ex. 79). Production expense of the Cascade lumber Company between

1910 and 1916 reduced their average selling price of $lh.605 to a net

Of $2.03hl per thousand board feet of lumber (Def..Ex. 60).

65. Two valuation experts appearing before the Commission differed

materially in their conclusions of value, both as to the Cedar Valley
and Tract C lands. Hr. Karl D. Hense, testifring for petitioners, was a
member of the firn.of dason, Bruce and Gerard, referred to in our Finding
No. A2. He did not consider himself especially qualified to appraise grasing land, but thought the cedar Valley tracts did have a definite value in
1904 for grazing purposes and by drawing upon “valuatidns and transactions
as of the time when similar lands were involved and similar values" here
found, he testified this land on December 21, 1906, was worth $30.00 per
acre, which he said represented:
5 2.00 per acre for the land
2&.05’ per acre for Pcnderosa pine, or $1.85 per thousand
for a stand of 13,000 board feet per acre

3.00 ,per acre for an estimated 3,000 board feet of mixed timber
He considered the timber readily accessible, the area excc11cnt.1ogging
ground and that there was a definite market for the land in 1906 as the
lake States werebeing cut out and the pinerics in.the south were reaching
their peak of production. (Trans. 13-2%).

Hr. Henze‘s familiarity with Yakima County lands dated from.19L8. He

had inspected this land, and his firm has'annna1ly‘checked the timber

\

accounts of J.’ Neils Lunzcer Company since that company acquired the

Cedar Valley tracts in l9!.:.6. He: had not checked county records to
ascertain what land transfers had occurred within Yakima or hlickitat
Counties on or about the appraisal dates or the considerations paid,
or whether commercial lumbering was being carried on within Yakima
County in 1901... It is not claw from the record shat land transfers
were used by him for comparison purposes (Trans. p. 1+9). Upon crossexarnination he referred to a valuation by the Bureau of Internal Revenue of.‘ $1.75 per thousand placed upon ti:-.ber 90% pine and l0% fir belonging to the Cascade Innber Company, which. he considered more acces-sible but no more desirable than the Cedar VaLLe3r tracts, but he did

not know when that coInpa..‘D.y had acr*_=_uired the tixaber or the consideration
paid. Reference was made to a 900,000 acre purchase’ on the Pacific
coast in 1900 by the Weyerhaeuser Lumber Company for $6.00 per acre,

where ‘Douglas fir ran over 30,000 board feet per acre (Trans. pp. 213-1.),

and to a Gilchrist purchase of an indefinite acreage some 200 miles away

where Ponderosa pine ran 14,000 board feet to the acre, and to timber on
he Klamath Indian Reservation some 300.r-'3 les array, as comparable timber
transactions. The comparability of these lands is not in evidence, and
this Commission looked with disfavor upon evidence touching the Gilchrist and Klaznath lands due to their great distance from the lands here
involved, yet the record clearly suggests they were given weight by .133... .
I-Eenze in his evaluation of the instant lands (Trans. 49-53, 57-61).
(b) Hr. Miller, dei‘endant‘s expert witness, made a most extensive
investigation of the settlement and ecc:::c::=.ic dc‘-relopreent oi‘ 1'a’.c:I..'::.e and

Klickitat countie . Defendant's '"-rhibit 150. L3 has been of Inateri

benefit to this Commission and was readily cited by both defendant

and petitioners in their respective briefs although widely differ)

I

ent conclusions have been drawn from the information compiled. hr.
Killer supported his valuation appraisal by reference to information
obtained by examination of county records, to more than 300 sales he
had abstracted from the county records in Klickitat County (Finding
No. 40); to information gleaned fron.the private records of the Cascade Iumber Company; and a study of prevailing economic conditions,

accessibility and quality of available timber, and such other items

as influence prospective purchasers and are properly elements of

_value.

Hr. Miller’s conclusion was: so much timber was available with\

in the Northwest in l9OL only the more accessible stands possessed a

market value; that no value was attached to the timber on the Cedar

Valley tracts because of the acres of.more accessible timberlands be-'

tween them and the nearest markets, and that the tracts would have

been attractive only to speculators. He pointed out that stumpage

vas first purchased within Yakina.County nine years later and in

Klickitat County in l9l8, and he discounted the maximum prices paid
by settlers under the Public land laws, pointing out the early aban donment of practically all these tracts as homesites, and that theyI

had not attracted conmer ial investors or speculators unti. l925 an
l926, and no interest was evidenced in.logging then until 1946.

From the history related by surviving pioneer settlers and other

\

research, Mr. Miller concluded these lands had no agricultural worth

in 190a, that they had no particular value as grazing or as timber5 65

D

lands due to the hundreds of thousands of more accessible areas within the country, and upon consideration of comparable sales, and other
features, concluded that on December 2l, l90t, they had a nominal Va-ue of only 50¢ per acre.

TRACT C.

 

#6. Tract C is located in the northern part of the Yakima Reservation about the headwaters of the Klickitat River and between
the South Fork of Hhtanum Creek and Reservation.Creek, some l2
miles north of the northernmost of the Cedar Valley tracts. Its topography is extremely rugged and broken. Elevations vary from
h,lOO to 7,000 feet with any terrain bel'w 5,000 feet found only in
the deep canyons. ln the higher areas are found white fir, larch
and Douglas fir. The lower areas have some Ponderosa ci e, spruce
and lodgepole pine of litt.e commercial value (Trans. p. 155; Def.
Ex. #9, p. 20). A considerable part of the west and south slopes
are nearly barren. There is no evidence that scenic views, minerals, wild life, agricultural possibilities or watershed conservation uses contribute to its value. Portions of the tract are'well
watered and some natural meadow areas are found. Grazing is carried on within these valleys during July, august and September,
the forage being pinegrass, peavine, sunflowers and weeds. The
nearestrcilroad is the horthern.Pacific line extending from
Yakima to Seattle and gassing more than fifteen.miles northeast of
the area. In l923 a trail ran through Tract C but there is no

sections within it and received patents thereto. In 1923 the tatc

of Washington, acting under authority of the Act of February 22,
1839, 25 Stat. l76, selected the intervening sections and had patents issued to it. The average date of issuance of all patents is
January 2a, 1923. of the total area of l8,09i.A2 acres. the patent—
ed land comprises 17,669.10 acres and the Indian title has never
been extinguished to £25.32 acres. Petitioners may recover for a
taking of l7,669.l0 acres in Tract C.

1.8. From 1923 to l928 the Northern Pacific Railroad Company
rented some of its patented land for rentals varying from.2%¢ to
In l928 it sold the major portion of its

holdings in this vicinity for from 50¢ to $2.50 per acre. Additional sections were disposed of in 1931 within the same price
range. The purchaser defaulted and in l9L2 a very large unit coma

prised of land within Tract C and other land adjacent to and.north
of Tract C whidh bore a considerable amount of commercial timber,
sold for $2.00 per acre (Def. Ex. L9, p.69; Tran . 153, et seq.}.

The State of'dashington has sold none of the lands within
Tract C which were patented to it (Def. Ex 64).

A9. The nearest land to Tract C which has exchanged hanis
since its patent date is the 2,546.2 acre tractl about the millsite at the mouth of hasty Creek on Ahtanun Creek, which sold for
$1.00 per acre in 1906 (Findinc Eo. £l(a)). land ianediately north

of Tract C with a uch more regular contour and mu h lower altiJR‘
-tude, sold in l9l? for $2.00 per acre (Trans. pu. 152-3; Def. V?

49, p. 63 .

"1:;':g§;.:'.~

5 . Yakima County has valued the land in Tract C for taxa=
uion purposes at $1.00 per acre since l923, and has never assessed

it as other than erasing land (Trans. p. lO9; Def. Ex. L9, p. 67).

The timber on it is described as rough, short a d limby on the county’s

Jl9lO cruise sheets, and there are frequent comments that it is too
small to have a commercial value. There are si.-':.ilar rem rks upon the
1928 county cruise sheets, together with references to fire damage, unfavorable logging conditions and inaccessibility (Trans.pp. 154-5; Def.
EX. 49,;p. 126-lh9), although by this late date logging had become
mechanized (Trans. p. 185).

A wide variation in the timber stand is reflected on cruise

Township l2 North, Range l3 East, show no timber at all on.Section 20,
but 72 board feet of tamarack per acre on.Section 28, and 1622 board
feet per acre on Section 32, this being the heaviest stand reported
and consisting of western pin; hemlock, lodgpole pine, tanarack and
spruce (Pet. Ex. 85).

Between 1923 and l925 the average price in Eastern'Hashington
was $2.50 to $3.00 per thousand for pine and from.$l.OO to $1.50 per
thousand board feet for red fir and other species.

(b) Mr. Miller thought that Tract C was no more éccessible in
1923 than the Cedar Valley tracts had been in 190%; that the timber had
but little commercial value; that the best use for this land was grazing.
Based upon the rental.income it produced, its best use, isolated location
and comparable sales data, Mr. Miller placed a value of $1.00 per acre
upon the Tract C lands as of 1923 and 1225.
