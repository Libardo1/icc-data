Defendant.

Decided: vApril S, 1954
FINDINGS gg FACT

The Commission makes the following findings of fact:

1.1 The plaintiffs are entitled to maintain this cause of action.

2. At the time of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Sioux
Indians occupied, with other tribes, a large area of land situate in
the territory now comprising the States of Minnesota, Iowa, South
Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming and Montana, and, of this

area, the mountainous region now known as the Black Hills, South

Dakota, was a part.

3. The discovery of gold in California in l848.resulted in
a tide of emigration, some of which passed through Wyoming and
Nebraska where several of the Sioux bands of Indians and those of
other tribes, lived, roamed, and hunted. As a result of this western
travel a treaty was negotiated with the Sioux Indians, and other
Indian tribes of the Northwest, known as the Fort Laramie Treaty of

September 17, 1851, (11 Stat. 749). Article 5 of this treaty

follows:

Article 5. The aforesaid Indian nations do
hereby recognize and acknowledge the following
tracts of country, included within the metes-and

boundaries hereinafter designated, as their respective territories, viz:

The territory of the Sioux or Dahcotah Nation,

‘commencing the mouth of the White Earth River, on

the Missouri River; thence in a southwesterly

direction to the forks of the Platte River; thence

up the north fork of the Platte River to a point

known as the Red Bute, or where the road leaves the

river; thence along the range of mountains known

as the Black Hills, to-the headwaters of Heart

River; thence down Heart River to its mouth; and

thence down the Missouri River to the place of

beginning. ' "

4. The discovery of gold in.Montana in 1861 resulted in a
further tide of white emigration through the territory occupied by
the Sioux Tribe of Indians, as described in the treaty of 1851. This
line of travel was northward from the California Trail, near old Fort
Laramie, Wyoming, along the valley of the Powder River, to and across
the Yellowstone River and westward into the gold fields of Montana.
,As a result of this travel, disputes and conflicts arose with the
Indians over this route on account of the large number of white
travelers passing along it, and, between 1861 and 1867, there were
a number of military engagements between the Government and the

l

Indians.

5. Following the so-called Powder River War of 1866 and 1867
with the Sioux Indians, a treaty was entered into between the United
States and the various bands of the Sioux Indian Tribe which was
concluded April 29, 1868, and was ratified February 16, 1869, and

proclaimed February 24, 1869; (15 Stat. 635, 640). This treaty was

 

 

I _,,, __ _. -- _.,_..._.__............"..'...-.......-.....___ _ _ _ .....-...._._.-._.-.——._A.-.-_........—.._.-..._—_-.. ...-..._ ..-—. .-_..

negotiated, made, and ratified pursuant to an act of Congress of
July 20, 1867, (15 Stat. 17), as follows:

Sec. l. That the President of the United States

he, and he is hereby, authorized to appoint a commission to consist of three officers of the army not

below the rank of brigadier genera1,who, together

with N. G. Taylor, Commissioner of Indian Affairs,

John B. Henderson, Chairman of the Committee on Indian
Affairs of the Senate, 8. S. Tappan, and John B. Sanborn,
shall have power and authority to call together the chiefs
and headmen of such bands or tribes of Indians as are now
waging war against the United States or committing depredations upon the people thereof, to ascertain the alleged
reasons for their acts of hostility, and in their discretion,
under the direction of the President, to make and conclude
with said bands or tribes such treaty stipulations, subject
to the action of the Senate, as may remove all just causes
of complaint on their part, and at the same time establish
security for person and property along the lines of railroad
now being constructed to the Pacific and other thoroughfares
of travel to the western Territories, and such as will most
likely insure civilization fof the Indians and peace and

safety for the whites.

Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That said commissioners are required to examine and select a district
or districts of country having sufficient area to receive
all the Indian tribes now occupying territory east of the
Rocky Mountains, not now peacefully residing on permanent
reservations under treaty stipulations, to which the Government has the right of occupation or to which said com"missioners can obtain the right of occupation, and in which
district or districts there shall be sufficient tillable or
grazing land to enable the said tribes, respectfully, to
support themselves by agricultural and pastoral pursuits.
Said district or districts, when so selected, and the
selection approved by Congress, shall be and remain
permanent homes for said Indians to be located thereon,
and no person(s) not members of said tribes shall ever be
permitted to enter thereon without the.permission of the
tribes interested, except officers and employees of the
‘United States: Provided, That the district or districts
shall be so located as not to interfere with travel on high‘ways located by authority of the United States, nor with the
route of the Northern Pacific Railroad, the Union Pacific
Railroad, the Union Pacific Railroad Eastern Division, or

General Wm. T. Sherman, General Wm- S. Barney, and General
C. C. Augur were designated commissioners by the President, as the
three Army officers provided for in the statute.

6. In the fall of 1867, the.treaty comissioners submitted
a proposed treaty to a large number of the leaders and members of the
Sioux Indians at Fort Laramie. The negotiations between the commissioners and.the leaders and members of the various bands of the
Sioux Tribe of Indians contunied in the spring of 1868. .Upon the
insistence of the Indians certain concessions were made by the com-missioners representing the United States. As a result the treaty
was agreed to by the portion of the Sioux chiefs, leaders, and
members of the tribe (Red Cloud and his band) at Fort Laramie on
April 29, l868, and the treaty was subsequently agreed to at various
following dates by Sioux chiefs, leaders, and members of all the
remaining bands of the Sioux Tribe.

The Siour Indians‘who were parties to the 1868 Treaty, supra,
were those Indians, or the ancestors of the Indians, who still belonged
to the same bands designated in the said treaty but who are now, by
reason of subsequent acts of Congress and agreements ratified by the
Congress, the plaintiffs in this action.

7. The Treaty of 1868, (15 Stat. 635), made this finding as
if quoted verbatim.l M

I 8. The portion of the land in controversy in this case embraced
within the boundaries described in Art. 2 of the treaty of 1868 for
the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the Indians,

known as the Black Hills lands, consists of about 7,345,157 acres

lying between the 43rd and 46th standard parallels east of the 104th
meridian and west of the l03rd meridian and the forks of the Cheyenne

River. This land, which it is claimed was taken of misappropriated

‘by the defendant, is designated in the petition as "Class A? land.

The other land-denominated-in the petition as "Class 3“ land,

as to which additional compensation is sought, consists of 25,858,595
acres lying west of the Missouri River and included in the outer
boundaries described in the Treaty'of September 15, 1851, but exclusive
of the area described as a Permanent Reservation by Article 2 of the
treaty of 1868.

The other land denominated in the petition as "Class C", as to

h'which additional compensation is sought, consists of 40,578,123 acres

lying west and north of the irregular boundary lines established by the
treaty of 1851 as the western and northern boundaries of the Sioux
country. (See treaty of_l85l and treaty of 1868).

9. pPrior to 187s there had been, in 1861 and again in 1873,

somejpublic rumors and agitation with reference to the desirability

of the Black Hills -- its rich land, fine timber, good climate, and
abundant water supply -- for white settlements and for mining, because
of its gold-bearing possibilities. Prior to and at the time the treaty
of l8o8 was made the Sioux Indians knew that the Black Hills contained
gold, but the Government had no accurate information about the matter
and, up to that time, no exploration of the area had been made. The

Custer Expedition left Fort Abraham.Lincoln, Dakota Territory (now

North Dakota), July 2, l874, and returned to that Port.August 22, 1874.

On this expedition gold was discovered in paying quantities in the
Black Hills within the_Sioux Reservation. This discovery of gold was
made public in dispatches to the public prints.August 27, 1874 and
thereafter, whereupon a movement of white citizens soon began toward i
the gold region of the Black Hills and, in 1875, invaded that terricory which was within the permanent reservation of the Sioux.Tribe

of Indians. Upon return of the Custer Expedition in 1874, the

Indians of the Sioux Tribe became aware that the Black Hills contained
gold in payingquantities. .At that time the Black Hills area was
surrounded on almost all sides by white settlements; railroads were

in operation, the Union Pacific to the south and the Northern Pacific
to ‘the north oi the black Hills; and the Missouri River carried a
traific in steamboats.. Thus, facilities were open to white citizens
to within comparatively short distances of the Black Hills‘ gold fields

10. In May 1875 it became imperative, in the opinion of the

President, to bring a de1egation.from the Sioux Tribe to Washington
for a preliminary discussion of the matter of purchase by the Government of the hunting rights on what are called Class "B" and Class "C"
lands and the Black Hills section of the Sioux Reservation, and the
opening of the Big Horn Mountain country for settlement and mining.

Negotiations to that end were renewed by the President in June 1875

when the delegation of the Sioux Indians visited Washington to conside‘
the matter further. This delegation consisted, among other Indians,

of Red.Cloud, Sitting Bull, Spotted Tail, Lone Horn, and Little'Wound.

ll. A.council was held May 27, l875. On that day the Secret

of the Interior stated to the Indians, in part, as follows:

Now I want you to remember another thing. This treaty
of 1868 set off a large tract of country for you to occupy,

lying in the north part of the United States and away west.

It also provided that you might hunt in all the

country north of the North Platte and east of the Big Horn
Mountains.

It also provided that you might hunt on the Smoky Hill
Fork of the Republican, as long as the buffalo ranged there,
so as to justify the chase. This was nearly seven years ago;
now the buffalo is not found on the Smoky Bill Fork of the
Republican, so as totmake it worth while to hunt them” The
buffalo north of the'North Platte have also been driven away,
to such an extent, that you cannot find any large quantities
there, and the white people are pressing the Government_for the

privilege of settling also along the Smoky Hill Fork of the
' Republican. '

_ A ‘We cannot stop the white people from going out there.
' ‘we cannot prevent them from anxiety to take these lands,

_ especially when the buffalo are gone so as to render it un'“ desirable for you to be there.‘ ‘

‘Now you see the Government has more children than you;
you are the Government's children, the children of the Great

Father; so are the white people;-and the Great Father has to
do what is best for all..I want you to consider these things for the purpose of
doing what is best for all the children of the Great Father.

’ 12. On June 3, l875,.the President held a council with the Indian
delegation with reference to the relinquishment by the Sioux Tribe and

the acquisition by the Government of certain hunting rights and also

the Black Hills portion of the reservation. The President stated to

the Indians in part as follows:

In regard to the Black Hills, I look upon it as very
important to them (the Indians) to make some treaty by which,
if gold is discovered in large quantities, the white people

will be allowed to go there, and they receive a full equivalent
for all that is rendered.

If gold is not found there in large quantities, of course
the white people won't for the present want to go there, and

tau»...their country will be left as it is now.

The Secretary of the Interior, and the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs, will explain to them hereafter, about
what would be probably a fair equivalent to the white

. people and to them which should be given in case they should

surrender. the BlackHill‘s, or the portion in. which gold may
be found. As I pointed out to you before, there will be
trouble in keeping white people from going there for gold,
if it should be discovered * * * it is possible that strong

efforts might not be made to keep them out.

My interest is in seeing you protected, while I have
the power'Lto make treaties with you which shall protect you.
After you go back to your homes and have been there a sufficient
time to talk pretty generally with your people, if I get such

a word from you as to make it seem desirable, I will appoint

commissioners to go out to confer with you. But it

important to you that while you are here, you settle the question
of the limits of your hunting grounds, and make preliminary
arrangements to allow white persons to go into the Black Hills.
If it should come to the purchase of the Black Hills or a portion

of that country from you I would try to see you get a full equivalent in value, and that that money be paid out in U. 8. bonds
deposited here, so that the interest would be drawn twice 9. ye...
for your benefit, and be expended for your bendfit each year as
might be agreed upon, and I look uponit as very important to

you, and your children, the Indians who come after you, that you
encourage all you can, the children‘ attending schools, in speaking English and preparing yourselves for the life of white men.

ISECREIARY. Theagreement for the relinquishment of the

hunting privileges in Nebraska has been drawn up ready for you
to sign. .

rm PRESIDENT. That agreement has been shown to me and
I approve of it and would be glad to have you sign it. I will
say agains whenever the Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs talk to you they talk for me, and

if there "is any point they cannot quite agree upon they will

submit the views of the Indians and their own views to me to

decide between them.

One word more that has nothing to do with this -- I have
always felt, ever_ since I was a young officer of the Army, a
great interest in the welfare of the Indians. I know that

formerly they have been abused and their rights not properly

respected. Since it has been in my power to have any control

over Indian affairs I have endeavored to adopt a policy which
should be for your future good, and calculated to preserve

‘ peace beween the whites and Indians forthepresent; and it is

° “my great desire, now while I can retain some control over
the matter, that the initiatory steps should be taken to
secure you and your children hereafter. If you will cooperate with me I shall look always to what I believe is
for your best interests. ‘Many of the Indians who accepted
at an early day what we proposed to you today are now
living in houses, have fences around their farms; have
school houses, and their children are reading and writing as we do here. *'# * I I

-Where there is a population of industrious people
who understand how to work, they cannot let their population be pent up and be destroyed while there is territory where they can go and get a subsistence. .And what
I want to do is to prepare the Indian for a contingency
that will be sure to arise, so that he will be able to
live upon the ground and get a support from it. The same
as white people. ‘This question that he (Red Cloud) is
discussing, is one of sentiment, but it will have to give
‘way before the growth of numbers who are not going to
starve, merely out of a sentimental consideration of a
title that others may have. '

.In all this matter, and in all my dealings with the
Indians, as I have explained frequently, and once or twice
today, I am looking more to their interests than to ours;
and I am.very anxious that the Government of the United
States should pay them in a way that will be of most
benefit to them, a full equivalent for all that they have
given up, and this is the only way I see a chance of their
‘having in the future a fair equivalent of what they surrender.

You may say to Red Cloud, in answer to what he stated
a little while ago, that he did not like to have money
collected for what is his, that what we are doing, is pay, ing money which is not his, for buffalo which he claims,p
but which he has not the right to. '

13. This comission held councils with the leaders and members
of the Sioux.Tribe in their country, but was unable to arrive at any
terms with the Indians for the relinquishment or sale of the Black

Hills. The efforts of the commission to secure the results desired by

the Government were fruitless, and, on June 29, 1875, the commission

submitted to the Indians their final propositions:

Greenwich crosses said river, and to pay the Indians for their interest
therein the sum of $50,000 annually for ten years, amounting to $500,000,

to be paid in cows and other livestock, and in such implements of

advisable by the President.
The Indians refused to consider the question of cession of that
, portion of Wyoming known as the Big Horn country on the ground that it
‘was valuable to them to roam over and hunt upon and would not consent
zto surrender it. The commission; having serious doubts whether there
was gold in the Black Hills in sufficient quantity to make mining profit;able, submitted the above-mentioned Black Hills proposition in the alterna:tive. The Indians refused the offer. The Comission so reported to the
-President. I T i
i:~l:; l4. Theretofore, on.March 27, 1875, by direction of the President,
I ‘Walter P. Jenney, mining engineer, was instructed and authorized to make
, .

a survey of the Black Hills and report on the mineral, the timber, and

the agricultural resources thereof. On November 8, l875, he submitted

a report as follows:

Sir: In compliance with your request for preliminary
statements respecting the mineral and agricultural resources
of the Black Hills in Dakota, and the work done under my direction during the past summer in exploring and mapping that

‘h ‘portion of the Territory, I have the honor to make the follow-7¢ ing report in brief: *f* *

Without entering into details regarding the manner of
working or of incidents in the history of the expedition;
how on reaching the hills, I found miners prospecting

on French Creek; how after a month‘s work gold was found
in paying quantities on Spring and Rapid Creeks; how the
‘miners poured by hundreds into the hills, and accompanying me, gave me great assistance in prospecting the
country; I will briefly state such results of the work

--as will tend to throw light on the probable future value
of the region. '

That portion of the Black Hills which may be designated as Harney's Peak gold field is almost wholly:in
Dakota and extends about fifty miles north and south with

-_an average breadth of nearly fifty miles north and south

‘with an average breadth of nearly twenty miles, covering
an area of not less than eight hundred square miles. The
valuable gold-deposits, however, are found in the valleys

;¢of the streams which drain that area, the gold being derived

from the disintegration of the quartz-ledges, which are very

' numerous in.the rocks of that region.

The most extensive and valuable deposits of auriferous
gravel discovered during the past season were in the valleys

_of Spring and Rapid Creeks and their tributaries, where, in

almost every case, the gravel-bars are very advantageously

.-, situated for working, and where many-natural circumstances

contribute materially to the profitable extracting of the
gold which they contain. "

Timber of suitable size and quantity for the construction
of flumes and sluices is abundant; the water supply is, in

most localities, ample, and the fall of the streams sufficiently
great to enable the water to be readily carried above the

r level.of even the more elevated bars and deposits of gravel.

While as yet there have been discovered in the Black
‘Hills no deposits of gravel sufficiently rich in gold to be
profitably worked in the primitive manner with pan or rocker,
yet there are many bars in the‘Earney’s Peak field, especially

a. upon Spring Creek, the forks of Castle and Rapid Creeks, and

the valleys of those mountain streams, which, when skillfully
‘worked by gangs of miners with sluices, will yield a good i

.return for the labor employed and the moderate capital required to be invested. But little could be done in a single
season in prospecting the numerous segregated quartz veins
of this region, some of which undoubtedly contain gold. I

have procured abundant samples for testing their value by “
assay. a ’

The Bear Lodge gold field, situated in the extreme northwestern portion of the hills, is wholly in Wyoming, and entire
separated from.the Barney Peak region. It does not exceed

.--- ——- -1.. —-——-.-o-—-- - "’ """""""'-"""‘ """"' “u

..,._.' .._....-.-.............__..J

fifty square miles in area; the gold deposits

are small compared with those on Rapid Creek, and are
remarkable for the absence of quartz in the gravel, the
gold being derived from the disintegrations of feldspar

porphyry, carrying irregular masses or iron and manganese
ore.

It is difficult to determine the agricultural resources
or climate of the Black Hills by the observation of a single
season, expecially as I could gain but little information
respecting the severity of the winters or the prevalence of
early and late frosts.i The Black Hills rise like an island
from an ocean of grass covered and treeless plains, watered
by occasional and scanty supplies of rain; and the winds in
passing over these plains gather some moisture which they
part with as rain on being chilled by contact with the colder
and more elevated region of the central portions of the hills.

,,The result of this is the prevalence of frequent though not

. heavy rain-falls, giving to the hills a most peculiar climate.
There is scarecely a day from May to August without one or two
showers, yet, owing to the dryness of the-atmosphere, the climate
was found to be very healthy. During the past season,
after August 1,.very little rain was experienced, and some
of the.smaller streams'contained water only in pools. That

_ this remarkable rain-fall, in a region where the average fall
does not exceed ten inches for the whole year, was not the
exhibition of a peculiarly wet season, I can only judge by
observation on the growth of the plants and trees.

The abundance of trees and the coarseness of their grains,
as well as the growth of plants on dry hillsides exposed to
both sun and wind, tend to show that the season which I witnessed

was by no means a very unusual one, though the amount of rain
may have been somewhat greater than usual.

The-area of land suitable for cultivation is, from the
mountainous character of the region, limited as compared with
the vast area embraced in the hills, but the soil along the
streams and in most of the valleys is deep and fertile, and will
be sufficient for the requirements of the population which the
hills will support as a stock-raising community. I should judge
from the observations which I have had the opportunity to make
that at least one-twentieth of the three thousand square miles
embraced in the Black Hills may be fairly described as arable
glands, and_that among these lands lying near the streams and
continuous through the hilly country are large tracts of lan
forming the slopes of the hillsides which, while he: arable, will

afford fine grazing, thus largely enhancing the value of the
;lands to which they are contiguous.

Among the rocky areas of the Harney's Peak range, and

in the northern portion of the hills, there are regions ' ’

where the grasses are comparatively wanting, but generally,
throughout the whole area of the hills a luxuriant growth
of the finest grasses is to be found,'even covering the ground

under the shade of the pine trees upon the elevated divides
between the streams.

The abundance of fine quality of the grasses and the
-shelter afforded to stock by the densely timbered slopes and

deep valleys will make it a region well adapted to stock-raising purposes. S

The timber of the hills is a variety of pine known as
yellow or heavy pine; the grain of the wood is straight,
rather course, splitting readily, and where the trees have
2 escaped’the action of fires and violent gales, good straight
..’logs, free from knots, and from 40 to 60 feet in length, and
from 12 to 24 inches in diameter, can be obtained in abundance.

2 Spruce of good quality is found among the caions in the interior,
u'and white.birch, oak, and-elm, of medium.size, among the hills

~<»s on the eastern slope;

The water throughout the hills is excellent in quality,
mostly derived from springs among the limestone, or the

granitic or schistose rock; only in localities among the foothills is it contaminated by alkali.

15. In his annual report for the year 1875 to the Secretary of th:

Interior, the Comissioner of Indian.Affairs, on pages 7, 8 and 9 of th.

‘report said:

The public excitement mentioned in my last report, occasioned
by the discovery of gold in that portion of the Sioux reservation
known as the Black Hills country, increased to such a degree in
the opening of the spring season as to require action looking
toward the purchase of this country from.the Sioux proprietors

.and the opening up of the Big Horn Mountain country for settlement and mining. For this purpose, as well as for completing
the negotiations for the relinquishment by the Sioux of their
hunting rights in Nebraska and Kansas, a large delegation of

- this tribe, comosed of representatives from those agencies,

.was brought to Washington in May last for an interview with the
President. It was not expected that this interview would conclude the purchase, but that it would prove a preliminary stop
by which the Sioux tribe would become acquainted with the wishes
of the Government and its purpose relative to their own necessities and interests. Accordingly, at the request of the dele
gation, the President sent a commission, of which Hon. W. B.

' . . J -H

.Allison, of the United States, was made chairman, to negotiate
at a general council of the tribe in their own country. The
commission has not yet submitted its report, but I am informed
that the negotiations have failed on account of a wide disagreement as to the value of the rights to be relinquished,by

the Sioux. Meanwhile, notwithstanding the stringent prohibitory
orders by the military authorities, and in the face of the large
military force which has been on duty in and around the Hills

during the summer, probably not less than a thousand miners,
with the number rapidly increasing, have made their way into

. the Sioux country. A mining association has been organized,

laws and regulations have been adopted for mutual protection,
and individual claims staked out, in the right to which they
expect hereafter either to be protected by the Government or to
protect themselves... a

In this serious complication there seems to be but one
alternative for the Government; either to so increase the
military force and adopt such summary means as will insure
a strict observance of the treaty-rights of the Sioux by
preventing all intrusion, or to renew the effort of negotiation. However unwilling we may be to confess it, the
experience of the past summer proves either the inefficiency
of the large military force under the command of such officers
as Generals Sheridan, Terry, and Crook, or the utter impracticability of keeping Americans out of a country where gold is
known to exist by any fear or orders or of United States
cavalry, or by any consideration of the rights of others.

The occupation and possession of the Black Hills by white
men seems now inevitable, but no reason exists for making this

inevitability an occasion of wrong or lasting injury to the
Sioux. If an Indian can he possessed of rights of country,

‘either natural or acquired, this country belongs for occupation

to the Sioux; and if they were an independent, self supporting
people, able to claim that hereafter the United States Government
should leave them entirely alone, in yearly receipt of such
annuities only as the treaty of 1868 guarantees, they would he
in a position to demand to be left in undisputed possession of
their country, and the moral sense of mankind would sustain the
demand; but unfortunately the facts are otherwise. They are not
now capable of self-support; they are absolute pensioners of the
Government in the sum of a million and a quarter of dollars annually above all amounts specified in treaty-stipulations. A
failure to receive Government rations for a single season would
reduce them to starvation. They cannot, therefore, demand to be
left alone, and the Government, granting the large help which

the Sioux are obliged to ask, is entitled to ask something of them

in return. On this basis of mutual benefit the purchase of the
Black Hills should proceed. If, therefore, all attempts at

negotiation have failed on the plan of going first to the
.Indians, I would respectfully recommend that legislation be
now sought from Congress, offering a fair and full equivalent
for the country lying between the North and South Forks of
the Cheyenne Riyer, in Dakota, a portion of which equivalent

should be made to take-the place of the free rations now granted.

In order to provide for the question of a fair equivalent

.«for this country, by direction of the President, a topographical

and geological survey of the Black'Hills was ordered, the preliminary report of which, by Walter P. Jenney, mining engineer

in charge, will be found herewith. It furnishes many interesting
. and important facts respecting a region hitherto almost unknown.
Professor Jenney and his assistants are entitled to large credit

for the conscientious diligence and thoroughness, which are

apparent at every point in their work. The aid rendered

by the War Department, by the courtesy of the General of

the Army, and by Col. R. I. Dodge, commanding the escort,

has been invaluable to the success of the survey. Without

such aid, no satisfactory results could have been obtained,

on account of the limited funds available for this purpose.

The report confirms, in a large degree, the statements of

travelers and explorers and the rqaorts of General Custer's
military expedition of last year, and shows a gold-field

with an area of eight hundred square miles, and around this,
‘gold region, principally to the north, an additional area

within the Black Hills country of three thousand square miles

of arable lands, and this latter embracing along its streams

an area equal to two hundred square miles finely adapted to

agriculture, while the hill sides and elevations contiguous
ithereto are equally adapted to purposes of grazing, making
ithe'whole area of three thousand square miles of timber,

grazing, and arable lands of great value for agricultural
purposes. ‘

According to the findings of this report, if there were
no gold in this country to attract the white man, and the
Indians could be left to undisturbed occupation of the Black
_ Hills, this region, naturally suited to agriculture and herding,
gis the one of all others within the boundaries of the Sioux
reservation best adapted to their.immediate and paramount
necessities. I doubt whether any land now remaining in the
possession of the General Government offers equal advantages;
but it will be found impracticable to utilize the country for
the Sioux. So long as gold exists in the same region, the
agricultural country surrounding the gold-fields will be largely
required to support the miners, and to attempt to bring the wild

Sioux into proximity to the settlers and miners would be to
invite provocations and bloody hostili ’

These facts respecting the country which the Sioux seem
about to be compelled to surrender, for the sake of promoting
the mining and agricultural interests of white men, have an
important bearing upon the question of compensation which shall
be allowed for their lands; for it must be borne in mind that
unless the Sioux Nation becomes extinct, of which there is no
probability, the time is close upon them when they must have
just.such an opportunity for self-support as that which is now
known to be offered in the Black Hills; and if, for the want
of another such country, they are obliged to begin civilization
under increased disabilities, humanity as well as equity demands
that such disability shall be compensated by increased aid
from the Government; and to avoid the perils of future legislation, or want of legislation, the compensation should be
provided for and fixed at the time when we are taking away
their valuable lands.

The fact that these Indians are making but little if

any use of the Black Hills has no bearing upon the question
of what is a fair equivalent for the surrender of these rare
facilities for farming and grazing.l They are children, utterly
unable to comprehend their own great necessities just ahead;

-they cannot, therefore, see that the country which now only
furnishes them lodge-poles and a few antelope has abundant
resources for their future wants, when they shall cease to be
barbarous pensioners upon the Government and begin to provide
for their own living.t Their ignorance of themselves and of
true values makes the stronger appeal to our sense of what is
right and fair.

The true equivalent to be'offered the Sioux, as helpless
wards of the Government, for the Black Hills will be found by
:estimating what eight hundred square miles of gold fields are
worth to us, and what three thousand square miles of timber,
agricultural, and ggazing lands are worth to them,

16. In December 1875 the President, in his annual message to
Congress, recommended that, because of an anticipated large increase in
emigration to the Black Hills, the Congress should "adopt some measures

to relieve the embarrassment growing out of the causes mentioned."

And, in this message, the President stated in part as follows:

The discovery of gold in the Black Hills, a portion
of the Sioux Reservation, has had the effect to induce a

‘large emigration of miners to that pbint. Thus far the

efforts to protect the treaty rights of the Indians in that
section have been successful, but the nezct year will certainly

a witness a large increase of such emigration. The negotiations
_ for the relinquishment of the gold fields having failed, it

will be necessary for Congress to adopt some measures to
relieve the embarrassment growing out of the causes named.
The secretary of the interior suggests that the supplies now
appropriated for the sustenance of that people being no
longer obligatory under the treaty of l868, but simply

a gratuity, may be issued or withheld at his discretion.

l7. IThe Secretary of Interior in his annual report to Congress fo

l875 stated as follows:

The failure of the negotiations by the commissioners
necessitates the adoption of some measures to relieve the
department of the great embarrassment resulting from the
evident determination of a large number of citizens to
enter upon that portion of the Sioux Reservation to obtain
the precious metals which the official report of the geologist
sent out by the Government shows to exist therein. The very
measures now taken by the Government to prevent the influx of
miners into the Black Hills,-by-means of.the display of

military force, operate as the surest safeguard of the miners

.against the attacks.of Indians. The army expels the miners

and, while doing so, protects them from Indians. The miners
return as soon as the military surveillance is withdrawn, and

_the same steps are taken again and again. Some of the miners

have_brought suits against the military officers for false

.impkisonment, and much embarrassment to both army and the

interior department is the result. The preliminary report
of Professor Jenney, which accompanies the report of the
Indian comissioner, in regard to the geological and agricultural wealth of the Black Hills, indicates clearly the
great temptation held out to miners and emigrants to occupy

_that country, and will greatly enhance the difficulties which

have already surrounded the question of protecting the Siouk'in
their treaty rights in that territory. The opening of the next
summer season will undoubtedly witness a great increase of
emigration thither, and the question urges itself upon the
attention of the department and of Congress for early solution. tltsis true that the Indians occupy that reservation
under the provisions of a treaty with the United States. It

is also true, as a general proposition, that treaties should

be maintained inviolate, and the Zndians protected in their

rights thereunder. But for two years the Government has been
appropriating about one million two hundred and sixty thousand
dollars for the subsistence of Sioux of various tribes, which
amount is a gratuity that the Government is under no obligations
to give them, and for which it receives no compensating advantage.
The amount thus appropriated is 5 percent per annum of $25,000,000,
which the Government is giving without an equivalent. This amount
must be given them for some years to come, or they will starve.

It is submitted, therefore, under these circumstances, for the
consideration of Congress, whether it would not be justifiable

and proper to make future appropriations for supplies to this
people, contingent on the relinquishment of the gold fields in

the Black Hills and the right-of-way thereto.

18. The treaty of 1868, as its provisions show, contemplated that

the Indians, with the assistance agreed to be rendered by the Government,

9

would soon become self-supporting on the reservation. The United States
agreed in that treaty to equip them for farming and to furnish them all
needed facilities and assistance in that connection, to furnish them
educational facilities for not less than 20 years, and for a period of 30
‘years to furnish each Indian with articles of clothing, etc., and to pay
the sum of ten dollars for each Indian "while such persons roam and hunt,"
and twenty dollars "for each person who engages in farming" to be used

for the purchase of such articles as from time to time the conditions
and necessities of the Indians might indicate to be proper. In addition to all the other provisions of the treaty, the United States

agreed, in article 10, to appropriate and expend annually such sum as

might be necessary for the subsistence of the Indians of the Sioux

Tribe on the reservation for a period of four years. This last-mentioned provision of the treaty was fulfilled and finally discharged by

the appropriation and disbursement of $1,314,000 under the act of

February 14, l8?3 (17 Stat. #37, 456), for the fiscal year ending

to negotiate with the Sioux Tribe for the desired cessions and stipulations as provided in the act of 1876, supra. This commission proceeded to the Sioux country to conduct negotiations with the Sioux
tribes and bands at the different agencies on the Great Sioux Reservation and submitted to them.a proposed agreement conforming to

of article l0 of the treaty of 1868 had long since been fulfilled and
had become estinguished, and further stated to the Indians that there
no longer rested upon the Government any obligation to appropriate
and disburse large sums annually for their subsistence. The result
was that the commission was unable to obtain the assent of three-fourth
of the male adult Indians of the tribe to this proposed agreement. Mor
than 90 percent of the Indians refused to assent. The chiefs, headmen,
and less than ten per cent of the male adult Indians of the tribe at
the different agencies assented to and signed the agreement on dates
ranging from September 20 to October 27, 1876.

The record ofthe negotiations of the commission with the Indians
of the Sioux Tribe discloses and shows that it was.impossible for r’
commission to arrive at an agreement in strict conformity with article
12 of the treaty of 1868 for the relinquishment or sale to the Govern-.

ment of the Black Hills for the reason that more than 90 percent of
the Indians refused to sell or lease the Black Hills and relinquish
their hunting rights to the Government at any price. The male adult
members of the tribe over eighteen years of age constituted about 25
percent of the entire population of the tribe. Some of the Indians
indicated a willingness to lease the mining rights in the Black Hills
to the Government for a consideration of $70,000,000 or for full subsistence for every Sioux Indian (then numbered between 20,000 and
30,000 persons) from that date, so long as the tribe existed.

The record, as a whole, does not justify a finding that the

chiefs, headmen, or the Indians of the Sioux Tribe who assented to

of the tribe was concerned was the best the Government could do in the
circumstances, was, in due course, submitted by the commission, with
its journal and minutes, to the President and by him transmitted to
Congress on.December 22, 1876 (Sen. Exec. Doc. 9, 44th.Congress, 2d
