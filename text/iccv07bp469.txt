hitt, Chief Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.

Petitioner herein, the Kikiallus Tribe of indians, alleges
ownership of certain land ceded by the Point Elliott Treaty of
January 22, I855, (l2Stat. 92?, II Kapp. 669). That it received
an unconscionable consideration therefor, and it asserts claim
for its value as of the date of cession, less the consideration
received.

The defendant alleges that the claim.is barred by the decision of the United States Court of Claims in Qpwamish, et al.,

Indians V. United 5tates (Docket F§275, 9 C. Cls. 530, l93A)

urged the same plea (lunni ilibe of ¢rdians v. United States, Dkt. llO,
5 Ind. Cls. Cor:-..‘-'r;. 5133).

Clearly, the Duwamish decision did not adjudicate the liability
issues.involyed in the present claim.which is based upon alleged aboriginal Indian title established by exclusive use and occupancy; Moreover, petitioner brings this suit under provisions of the Indian Claims
Commission Act, which authorizes the judicial consideration of Indian
rights that were not recognized at the time of the judgment plead in
bar. _

The Kikiallus was one of the Indian bands, who were one d? the
parties to the Treaty of Point Elliott, named both in its preamble,
as such, and also as a signatory thereto. The defendant denies that
petitioner is successor in interest of the_treaty~signing Kikiallus *
(Bit. Br., p. 7). There were no boundaries set out in the Point
iElliott Treaty, as to individual groups or tribes. ‘Defendant, in the
Point Elliott Treaty, simply took a cession of a large area of land
in what is now the northwestern part of the State of‘Hashington from,
some twentyhtwo or twenty-three Indian tribes, hands and/or groups of
that area. This petitioner claims a certain portion ofthat cession
as the lands to which they (Kikiallus) held aboriginal , or Indian
title, “or such smaller portion as conforms to the proof offered."

The petition described the land so claimed as follows:

Beginning at Point Demock on the northwest tip
''.’.I' ‘R? '

of Camano Island in Township 32 North, Range 2 E.«.m.;
thence in a northeasterly direction to the northwest

Susan Flats and on across Livingston Bay and Camano
Island to point of beginning, situate in Island, Skagit

and Snohomish Counties, State of Eashington (Petition,
Par. IV) i

Petitioner alleges the amount received by it for-its cession
‘was unconscionable and that the fair and reasonable value of lands
“occupied by claimants" and taken by defendant was the sum.of thirty’
million dollars. i _ o
The issues for determination at this stage of the case are
limited by stipulation of the parties to the questions of (1) capacity of petitioners to naintain this action and (2) what area, if any,
didpetitioner's ancestors or predecessors in interest exclnsively'
use and occuprih H it
i* thThe circumstances surrounding the negotiation and execution
of Ti§‘oo.§-.y or iPoint Elliott of January 22, 1855, have been set
forthinseveral prior cases (See Snohonish, Dkt. 125, A Ind. Cls;
gégé; Eng). _;2 « . e n e t n e
is hiiifm ihe kikiallus lndians here in aboriginal times rariouslr'i’
estimated to hare a population from.75 to l60. The large tracts of
land on northern Canano Island and on the mainland claimed by the
petitioner appear to be in.excess of reasonable bounds of need for
use, by this admittedly small tribe or band of fish-eating Indians.
iThe Kikiallus, like other fish-eating Indians of this area, ranged

over rivers,1aays and inlets and lands contiguous in their canoes

7 3nd. Cl. Con. #56 A72
in their quest for salmon, clams, berries, roots, fowl and small game.
The subsistence habits and social life of the Kikiallus were, in fact,
charactenistic of tribes in the Fuget Sound area, except they apparently were not slave-holders. Their sucsistence area, exclusively used
and occupied by'Kikiallus, seems to us to not extend greatly beyond
their-immediate village area, as we have set out in Finding 10; which
' area includes land along the shore on the north part of Camano Isiland as well as the South Fork of the Skagit River.
In.determining the aboriginal boundaries of petitioner lands from.

the evidence in this record, we are almost entirely limited to testimcny of modern Indians and data compiled from informants of modern

times, since the earlier records are of such fragmentary character and

' mention little more than a village tribe or band of Indians “on the

(la) . Kikiallus‘River." “The snall—size of this band of Skagit-speaking Indians was apparently such as to cause missionaries and governnent:men
to ignore them.entirely or, at most, to make bare mention of then.

The Kikiallus were principally situated in a tillage on the south
fonkporrthe Skagit River and spoke thesame kagit dialect as Skagits.

3Many[ethnological‘writers classify them.as a_§Skagit_subtribe." However, these'classifications were of a broad and general nature and the

ethnologins:mentioning Kikiallus and Shagit plainly qualify this classification as having no political implications.(Dr. C. L. Riley, III Tr.§D
Dr. George Gibbs, in his Report of Explorations at page h3i stated:

. . . . teilaguamish, whose country is on a stream
bearing their name; and still north of them the Kikiallus.
No opportunity has afforded itself for accurate inquiry into the numbers of eithergu The first are said by some to I
amount to tn: hundred, while the latter may perhaps be set
down at seventy-five. it a

7 Ind. Cl. Con. #55 474
The record establishes that the Kikiallus Indians were an aboriginal band with one principal village situated on the mainland with
use areas on adjacent islands, especially the north coast of Camano
Island. we have noted in all of_the cases presented by the fish-eating Indians of-the Puget Sound area that they conmingled freely'with
their neighbors as a general practice and roamed in their canoes over
a wide expanse of rivers, bays and inlets. The Kikiallus food gathering activities extended northwestwardly to Deception Passlaetween
Fidalgo Island and Whidbey Island, southward around Camano Island.
Some modern informants state they roamed overland some eight or ten
miles, eastward to EcHurray‘s Iake,4and northward up the Skagit River

past Hr. Vernon. The areas north of their village were also used by’

the Skagits, Eookachamps and Bsigwigwilts. They‘ shared the use of

 

areaseastward with the Bsigwigwilts, the Nookachanps, and also the
Stillaquamish. Joint use of Deception Pass, Whidbey Island and parts
2f Camano Island was made by the Skagit, Snohomish, Swinomish. Samish
and Stillaguamish Indians (Sally Snyder. 2 Tr. pp.60-73). (These jointly used areas are excluded from.the lands found as belonging to petitionr

er).

The defendant treated.with the Kikiallus as'a separately named group
in the Point Elliott Treaty. The Kikiallus were a single autonomous .
Village which constituted their essential land using unit. They roamed
along the south.fork of the Skagit River (formerly called "KikiaLlus River”),
Skagit Bay, and adjoining waterways. ‘we find.no:mention in the record in
this case of any political control erercised by the Skagits over the
Kikiallus. _we conclude the Kikiallus were a separate identifiable group

of American Indians.

7 Ind. Cl. Con. #56 475

The boundaries of Ki‘::iallus areas of land exclusively used and occupied bythen in aboriginal tmes are determined in Finding No. 10.
The area of -th‘eir principal village site is at the uppermost confluence .

of the numerous tributaries (or sloughs) branching off from the south

"fork of the Skagit River (Dft. F‘.. 2) The village site and‘ land circumscribed by» the sloughs form a heart-shaped tract of a land particularly described in Finding No. 10. J In Docket 125, Snohomish Tribe (Finding N . 9) we mentioned the separate use and occupancy of Caznano Island
by Kikiallus and Snohomish Indians as reported by Upchurch in the Pacific
Northx-re st Quarterly.

Upon the issue of successorship of petitioner, we have summarized
the evidence under Finding 2 of petitioner*s members and of early writers as to their ancestors constituting the aboriginal band of Kikiallus.
Indians. it Thisis not refutedby anytestimony offered by defendant. Defendant Dr. Riley, stated, "The group of modern Indians that
forms‘. are presumably the descendants . lo. . ."-(Dft. Ex. 1,

Oh. "i '  defendant in its objections to the petitioner's Requested

_ Finding 6 onriits successorsizip, adnonishes that no presumption is avail-—

able to petitioner. We conclude, however, since the testimony of peti witnesses stands uninpeached by any testimony offered by de-- l
fendant, and although the record is not voluminous with evidence on the
point ,’ch:'Lsis due to the smallness of this band, by reason of which their
successorship to the rights and interests of their forebearspwas not
formalized by such records as were kept by the largerRptri‘oes of Indians
whose chiefs often included men who had the benefit of a formal education or wl ose larger population attracted more attention of the ethnologists and government men than did the small band of Ki?-.=:iallus .
