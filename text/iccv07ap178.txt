0'}-Earr, Commissioner, delivered the_opinion of the Cogmission.

The Commission, on September l9, 1955, held that the petitioner
Pota:~rato:r1i Elation, as created by the Treaty of June 5, l7, l8LI,6, and as
it then existed, is entitled to an at-I.rd for the benefit of all descendants of said nation as it was constituted and recognized by the United
States in said treaty, in the sun of $h,3L;l,2l7.00, less $1,051,000
paid on said claim, leaving a not recovery of i333,29O,2l7«.OO. An interlocutow award in accord with said decision was entered on the s ne
date, subject to offsets, if any, allowable under the Indian Claims Commission Act, :50 Stat. lOLL9« (See 3.: Ind. Cl. Coma. 1:09-1472, i:.cl.). Cn
the ssne date, Septa.-rfoer l9, l9S6, the Commission made findings of :act,
rendered an opinion, and entered a fina_'L order '2-therein ‘b.=1C-3 ri
certain intervenors were determined adversely to said intervenors and
petitioners‘ motion to dismiss the intervening petition was sustained
(1; Ind. Cl. Cozr::r=.. }.'73-539)- The judgment of the C zr-mission dis:;1issi_ng

was urged as an offset against the Prairie Band and the Citizen Band
of Potawatomi Indians jointly. .A hearing was held with respect to the
claimed offsets and evidence both document if and oral presented to the
Commission.

Defendant in its proposed findings of ‘act conceded that certain sums
set forth in its amended answer were not itens that should be allowed as
proper offsets. These items consist of 316.00 for the purchase of two
beeves, $h.8O for the payment of expenses of the Indian agent acconpanring Indian delecations, and $203.51 claimed as an offset for Expenses of
Indian Delegations which sum defendant concedes can not be traced to petitioners.

In support of its claimed offsets defendant introduced in evidence
a report by the General Accounting Office (Def. Ex. 100) which hereinafter wi_l be referred to as the G. A. 0. Report, the testimony of
Francis J. Gillies, a supervisory examiner in the Indian Claims Section,
General.Accounting Office,under whose supervision the report was compiled,
and copies of'vouchers showing the disbursement of the suns claimed as offsets. I

The Commission has examined each item claimed as an offset by defendant and has applied the standards or guides applicable in offset cases as

previously determined bi the Court of Clahns.and this Commission in Quana:

Recovery of Livestock, $21.00

 

The Commission allows this item as a proper offset since at the tine,
in 1811.5, the cattle of the Pota.1:ato:ni Indians was CO1’;1.".".IlI3.cJ." ‘L3,-" 1.-med. A
similar item was aJ_loned in Osage Isfation v. ’Tnited States 3 Ind. Cl.

Conn. 11.25, 1426, 1:38. In C:u.ana.*.-I Tribe v. united States, supra, at page

   

73, recover-y of strayed or stolen livestock was denied as an offset but

this appears to have been based on the appropriation act (education and

Q

civilization) under which tne e::pend:'=.tnre ‘E-38.8 made by defendant.

Provisions, é3lSl;.OO (18-1353 to :].\.H,_',9 incl.).

 

Defendant claims offsets in the aaount of l:3l5'h..OO for pro‘-.='isio:‘:s
for Potanat rai Indians during the fiscal period l8I_r,6 to l8b,9, inclusive.
There is no question raised as to the accuracy of these disbursements
but petitioners object to their allowance because some of the items making up the total were expended for provisions at councils which  well
have been called by and for the conveniecne of the government. tlitnout
further proof the items $16.00 for beef, $12.00 for flour and ‘-$16.00 for
one beef and flour (Findrlng 71 (b) (l) and (2)) provided the

Exnenses of Indian Delegations - 20

 

Defendant claims as an offset the total sun of $86.20 expended for

the expenses of Indian delegations. This amount was expended ‘n loo; for

members of the Potanatoni tribal council on a visit to Leavenworth to transact business for the Potasatoni Tribe, with the Cdnnissioner of Indian
.Affairs. Petitioner contends the items nakinr uu this sum should be conCJ ..

Eannypenny at the direction of the President of the United States pro~

ceeded t Indian country to set inzaotion negotiations for such extin~uis.Ll

nent of Indian title. Hannypenny visited the tribes, including the~Potawatoni, in the Sumner of l8S3 and the expenditure for provisions was no
doubt made at that time. Since such negotiations'were for the benefit of
the United States the item is denied as a proper offset.

In 1861 Congress passed an Act "for the relief of the destitute Indians % % % she have failed in raising crops from the drouth of last sanmer * * *." .5 special agent‘was appointed by the Commissioner of Indian

‘Affairs to purchase and deliver to the tribes provisions under this act.

Among the tribes receiving such reliei provisions'sere the Potanateni to

whom were delivered 2h0l bushels of corn, ll barrels of son“ 27 plus

bushels of potatoes and 82 lbs. of bacon. ‘Petitioners contend that the

iiam $l,Ohl.65 expended for these provisions and claimed as an offset

should be denied for several reasons. Fetitioners urge among other

reasons that the Potanatoni were not in need and had considerable tribal

funds in the United States Treasury. The supplies distributed by the

special agent were based on tribal needs and turned over to the tribal

agents for distribution rather than distributing it himself to prevent

‘BL

waste. The circumstances causing the exyenciuures for this item, the

quantity of the provisions as a “hole and the fact that allotment was

based on a detenaination of tribal conditions leads the Commission to

Offsets 0lained.Solcly.igainst Prairie Band

   

Defendant sets forth a claimed offset of $130.00 solely against the
Prairie Band of Potawatoni Indians for oats and hay furnished in l9l6
and l9l?. The items making up this aggregate amount are not allowed as
‘proper offsets for several reasons. The vouchers for two of the items
show part of the expenditures being charged to Indian trust funds while
the balance is charged to the appropriation "Industrial Bork and 0are of
'Tnnber.” The remaining voucher is charged to "Industrial Eork and Care
oi Timber." Those portions of these vouchers not charged to Indian trust
funis nay'well have been for agency or educational pa poses. .Another
reason for denying these items as offsets results from an analysis of
ihe G. A. 0. Report. Expenditures charged to the appropriation “Industrial Work and Care of'Tinber" are set forth in Disbursement Schedule ho.
148 for the years 1912 thro'ugh 1919. only 31335.00 of the claimed offset of
$130.00 may be identified in said schedule. lhe total amount set forth in
