ADDIT I01‘-EAL FINDINGS Q FACT

The Commission makes, the folio:-Iing findings of fact:

1:3. The Cczrzmission has earlier in this Docket determined and bounded
the several separate tracts of land that were used and occupied as of.‘
July 2, 1872, by the Lakes, Colville, Sanpoil-Eespelern, Olcanogan, and
E-Iethot-I tribes respectively. By Interlocutor; Order dated February 29,
1956, the Commission has adjudged that the United States is liable to each
of these tribes for the value of its respective tract less the part thereof that lay within the reservation established for these and other tribes
by Executive Order of July 2, 1872. By the terms of the Cxmission‘s Interlocutorf Order, the amount of the liability of the United States to each
of said tribes is to be measured by the value as of July 2, 1872, of the
part of its respective tract that lay outside the reservation, less such
offsets as may be allowed by law. This trial has been held to determine
the value of each of said tracts (hereinafter called the subject r-acts)

as of.‘ July 2, 1872. The matter of offsets is reserved to a later proceeding.

The subject tract that was usai and occupied by the Lakes Tribe
(hereinafter called the Lakes Tract) and the subject tract that was used
and occupied by the Colville Tribe (hereinafter called the Colvj'_'Lle Tract)
adjoined the reservation to the east and were accordinrly bounded on

their west ‘sides by the Columbia River. The Lakes Tract was bounded on
its north by the United States-Canadian boundary, onits east 3; the summit of the ridge dividing the watersheds of the Columbia and Pend Oreille
rivers, and on its south by a due east-west line from the Columbia River.
The Colville T-act, bounded on its east by the summit of the divide between the Columbia €.;..d Colville rivers, consisted of the area that ch‘-ained.

Its northern perimeter, fronting on the river, consisted

of a system of benches, terraces and steep embanknents. In this region
there was a small amount of timber along the creeks and draws suitable
for fence posts, fuel, and cabin logs. On the plateau itself, there
were no areas of steep slope. Mostly the soil eas deep and supported a
heavy growth of grass. In places, however, conspicuously in.the eastern
part of the area east of the present town of Creston and also in the
neighborhood of the Grand Coulee, glacial erosion had left scabland
areas of shallow stony soils, "potholes" that beoane occupied by lakes
moderatelr or highly alkaline, and massive boulders, sane the size of
haystachs. On.most of the plateau, however, fen lakes, streams, or other
physical features occurred to vary the grassy'cover or rolling topography

these hills were largely open land; on the south they were largely forested.
Still further to the west, the tract was mountainous with high hills and

nantly forested land, the Lakes being almost entirely forest, the Colville

As of 1872, the Laices, Colville and Metho:-: tracts were predomibeing more than three-quarters forest, and the Methow being almost twothirds forest. The Okanogan and Sanpoil-Nespelem tracts were predominantly
open and covered with grass, the Sanpoil-tiespelem being almost entirely

covered, the Okanogan being approximately tn-Io-thirds grass covered. As

to the latter, the south part of the Okanogan Tract was almost enthely

grass covered, and the north somewhat more than one-half grass covered.
Host of the forested areas in l872 in each of the subject tracts were sufficiently open to have, and did have, good grass grazing lands.

60. The forests were mostly pine, ponderosa pine, white pine, and
lodge pole pine. The forest lands of the subject tracts are much below

the average of the ‘riorthwest generally, both as to stand and as to accessibility. As of l8?2 the Colville Tract timber was accessible while
much of the timber on the other tracts would not have been considered so.
In l872, there was no demand for the timber in this area, except for local

use, and the development of timber operations necessarily awaited transP0I‘tation and markets. There is no substantial evidence of lumbering

0§30I‘ations in the subject tracts for many, many years after the critical

date. As of 1872 approxih1atel' the following acreages of the Lakes,

Ckanoiian, biethow‘ and Colville tracts were forest covered:

Lakes Tract 311,305 acres

Okanogan Tract 123 , 1131 acres

I-iethow Tract

162,959

&CT€S

Colville Tract 99 , "108

acres

As of today the above acreages have been somewhat reduced through

lumbering operations and through clearing for agricultural use. A
substantial part of the forest region of these tracts is now embraced

in the Colville and Okanogan Forest Reserves. The amount of acreage

of these four tracts now located within the boundaries of these two

national forest areas is as follows: °

O

Lakes Tract 8S,§2h acres

Colvdlle Tract 99,108 acres _ '

Okanogan Tract 93,099 acres

Hethow Tract 205,157 acres

The total acreage of the Hethow Tract'within the boundaries of the na1.

tional forest reserve is largely in excess of the total amount of actual

forest lands in the tract, even as of l872. This is because a substantial
part of the lands included in the Okanogan Rational Forest is not timber

land but open grazing land. In addition to the availability of the timber

lands for grazing purposes these lands were important for the watershed
protection they furnished the region.

61. In 1872, the plateau region that constituted.most of the SanpoilNespelem Tract and a good portion of the southern part of the Okanogan
Tract was covered.with bunch grass. Bunch grass was early'known to afford
excellent grazing. Before 1872, its luxuriant growth had come also to be
known.to be evidence of fertile soil.

of 1872 and that these were the only white settlers claiming or occupying any area in any of the subject tracts as of 1872. While miners had
prospected extensively along the rivers and creeks within the subject
tracts beginning in the l8§O‘s, the peak of this mining activity had
passed before 1872 and no record has been shown of any mining claims or
mining settlements being worked or occupied in 1872 within any of the

any part of any of the subject tracts.

earliest reports of travel through the—res-_;ion date from 1811 and 181? when

by 1870, 23,1150. By 1870, more than one-quarter of ‘.£‘ashington‘s population

"resided in eastern 1-Fashington. The estimates of the population in Colville Valley before 1872 vary from a low of 600 to a high of 1200. The

l87O census showed Colwlle Valley at éhh, Spokane plaHlS at 9, Union
Flat at 118, Klickitat Valley at 320, Yakima Valley at LL32, and‘.-Ial_la

Walla Valley at 5300. By 1872 ‘.~Jal_'La T.~Ea]_la was the most important cit”
in eastern ‘-fashington. T.»;='a]_la E-Ealla was a cross-roads for people who came

from the north bjr way of I*Eu_'LLan's Road, or east from Portland or Vancouver.

It lay about 120 miles south of the subject tracts, on the road south frorzx
Colville Valley.

67. The principal activities that attracted settlers into eastern

Eiashingtton prior to 1872 were mining, cattle grazing, honesteading, and
the estal:-lis‘r::ent of tradmg points along routes of travel. In the l5SO’s
miners from California prospected widely the rivers, streams, and nountainous regions of eastern Washington. Placer gold was discovered on the
Eienatchee, the Okanogan, and the Coluznbia rivers, and, in greater quantiFor a tzine, Col‘=.ri3_le

almost entirely upon major zzaterwagrs and pr:'e.1itive I-zagon roads. The
Columbia River, excepting the portage about the Belles, carried steamboats up to Priest Rapids, about forty miles south of the subject tracts.
The Snake River carried steamboats to Letriston, passing also about 140 '
miles south of the subject tracts. The Col'r..i]_"_e Road, the oldest of the
pioneer trails, extended from 1-Iallula on the Colurrfbia River through Walla
Walla, and thence north:-yard to Colville Valley, s- irting the eastern portions oi‘ the subject tracts. Another early‘ pioneer road and trail took
off from Columbia River near Priest Rapids, extended northward to the
Colurnbia near its juncture with the Ckanogan and thence followed the early
Ohanogan trail up along the C-kanogan River to" the Fraser iE?.iver mines.

The Fiullan Road, built in 1862, connecting Esfalla E-Ealla with Fort Benton

in Montana, extended northward from ‘séalla tfalla to a pointabout forty '
miles south of the subject tracts before turning eastward. Cottorzt-Iood
Road was built in 1860 and passed about five to ten miles east of the
Colville Tract, con;.ecting ‘Colville ’-Ialle;; with Spohane Bridge. On all

these roads transportation was slow and freighticosts high. As of 1872,
