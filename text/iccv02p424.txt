FTNDINGS OF FACT

I 1. That on.February 12, 1925, Congress passed an Act (43.Stat. 886)

providing as follows:

"* * * that all claims of'whatevefrnature, both
legal and equitable, which the Mnckleshoot, San Juan
Island Indians; * * * may have against the United States
shall be submitted to the Court of Claims, * * *."

Some nineteen tribes filed separate petitions pursuant to said Act in the

the consolidated action.

2. ,Defendant's Exhibit #28, being The Indians of Puget Sound by

"The Muckleshoot (o'kElcu1) lived on the White
River, their territory extending from.Kent east to
the mountains. * * * The Duwamish. (Duxuduwa‘bc) lived
about the present site of Seattle, their territory
extending from.the‘Muckleshoot lands in the south to

. the Suquamish territory in the north."

A.map attached to the article assigns the Muckleshoot Tribe an area

~fV7;?3on the river beds and watersheds of Green River and White River.

Tribal Distribution by Leslie

(1936), at page 34, reads as follows:

"Muckleshoot. I follow:Haeberlin and Gunther in
giving this group a separate status on the map, but their
distinctiveness from.Duwamish and Puyallup is by no means
clear. They Write: ‘The Muckleshoot (o'kElcul) lived on
the White River, their territory extending from.Kent east
to the mountains.‘ On Gunther's map Green River is included,

as it is in the territory assigned by Curtis (White and Green
River valleys).

_ "It would appear from.Gibbs that there were a number ;
of small groups in this area. After mentioning Duwamish and
Suquamish, he writes (1856): ‘In this connection are also
the Samamish (included with the Duwamish on Gunther's map),
Skopahmish, Sk'tehlmish, St'kamish, and other small bands
lying upon the lakes and the branches of Dwamish River, who
are claimed by the others as part of their tribe, but have
in reality very little connection with them.....They (with
Duwamish and Suquamish) differ but slightly from the Niskwalli
in language." Since the Skopahmish were on upper green River
and the St'kamish (Sekamish) on White River, it would seem.
that the whole group belongs to the Muckleshoot division.

Add to these the Smulkamish on the upper'White River, ’
‘associated with the Skopamish.'"

A map attached to this article assigns the Muckleshoot ribe an area

on the river beds and watersheds of Green River and White River, the same

as Haeberlin and Gunther. (Def. Ex. #28).

4. The Court of Claims in Duwamish vs. United States, supra, found

as follows (Def. Ex. #2):

"XXV. The United States endeavored to, but did not
conclude or ratify treaties with the upper Chehalis, the
Muckleshoot, the Nooksack, the Chinook, and the San Juan
Island Indian Tribes."

5. Myron Eells, a former Indian Agent, writing in the American Antiquarian,‘March l, l887, at page l03, states (Def. Ex. #24):

"By orders of the President the'Muckleshoot reservation

was set apart for the benefit of the Muckleshoot Indians,
January 20, 1857, and April 9, 1874."

6. Defendant's Exhibit #26, being The North American Indians by

 

Edward 3. Curtis, (l9l3), at page 18, states:

"But for Leschi and Qai‘emuhl, Kitsap the Muckleshoot

Chief, and Stihhai the son of Leschi's aunt, no pardon was
offered * * *. '

"In August, I856, adequate reservations were made for
the Nisqually and the Puyallup, and a smaller tract on White
River was set aside for the Muckleshoot and Stukamish."

7. Defendant's Exhibit #l3_is a letter from the Secretary of the

Interior, dated January 13th, 1858, which reads as follows:

"Another post was established during the war at
Muckleshoot, a point in the interior, about 25 miles
from Steilacoom. At that station were collected some
300 of the most troublesome Indians, consisting of the

_Upper Puyallops, the Nooscoopes, and Green River Indians.
These tribes still reside in that vicinity.”

.;Tribe, were moved to the Muckleshoot Reservation about 1857 and their

descendants have resided there ever since.

10. The Commission finds that an identifiable group known as the

Muckleshoot Tribe of Indians was created in 1856 from the so-called
"pf;g:?’;Green River Indians known as the Skopabsh and their subordinate bands,
bc?¥_ pgand of the so-called White River Indians known as the Smulkamish and

11. The so-called Muckleshoot Tribe was a party plaintiff in
Duwamish, et al. Indians v. United States, 79 C. Cl. 530. The claim
there made was substantially the claim made in the present lawsuit.

Its case was dismissed because the Court held that it was without jurisdiction in a case between tribal Indians and the United States for the}

recovery of the alleged value of lands in the absence of a treaty or an

Act of Congress recognizing the Indians‘ title by right of occupancy

to the same.
