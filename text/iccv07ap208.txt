tracts aborieinally held by petitioners, which were located'eithout the
boundaries of the Executive Order Reservation of July 2, l8?2, were
acquired by the United States on July 2, l872, without the payment of compensation to the respective tribes and that the United States is liable

to petitioners for the value of said lands as of that date (h Ind. Cl.

Comm. 151).

The subject tracts adjoin the executive order reservation on the
east, south and rest. ?he Colville Tract is a narrow area of land lyins east of the Columbia River from just below Kettle Falls in the north

to near the present torn of Hunters in the south. _ts east boundary is

‘J

the summit of the divide between the Columbia and Colville rivers. This

tract contained 130,590 acres of land. North and east of the Colrdlle

area is located the Lakes Tract which is bounded on its north by the
United States-Canadian boundary} on the west by the Columbia River and
on the east by the summit of the ridge divir‘ug the watersheds of the

Columbia ard.Pend Creille rivers. The acreage of the Lakes Tract has been

detennincd to be 311,305 acres.

379,665 acres is located west of the Clcanogan River and northwest of

the Columbia with the I-Iethot-I River flowing through it in about its center
as far north as the town of Ttiisp. The southern Gkanogan area is located
in the present Douglas County while the northern Okanogan Tract and the
Methow Tract are contained in the present Ckanogan County.

The subject tracts are located in two geographical divisions of the

State of 1-Eashington.

The Lakes, Colville,_ northern portion of the Olcano-r
gen and the Itiethot-2 tracts are a part of the Okanogan Highlands, a predominately mountainous region which is principally a forest area but also
containing a substantial amount of open grazing lands. Eievations in
this geographical area rise to six and seven thousand feet. The Sanpoil—Nespelan and the southern part of the Okanogan Tract are in the northern

portion of the Columbia Plateau region of the State ‘where it makes contact '

with the Cicanogan Highlands. The plateau occupies the entire area south
of the Columbia River in the Big Bend country. The plateau is tilted.
slightly northward and its elevation at the northern edge is 21400 feet.
The surface generally is gently rolling. A prcninent feature of the area

is the C-rand Coulee, a glacial river bed that cuts a chasm a thoussand feet

deep and several miles wide north and south across the plateau. ".m.’1§_" 

ern part of these tracts contairsthe breaks and terraces of 
River and are znostly range lan today while the southern portiia
agricultural land. In 1872 most of this region 'as openvgrasslano.
‘:.:'ashington Territory was organized in 1853‘ and formerly embraced
lands in the present

‘Gates oi‘ Washington, Idaho , Montana and 

BY 1572 it had been reduced to its present size and contained Ll: t.:*'96,l:i¥s;5

acres. Over 25,000,000 of this acreage was located in the territory

east of the Cascade Mountains. According to the l87O United States Census the population of Hashington Territory was 23,955. The population

of eastern Washington at that tine was reported as 6852 persons of when
5300 lived in Ealla Walla Valley while the population of northeastern
Washington wherein the subject tracts are located was said to be 791 persons and most of these were in the Colville Valley;

The center of population in eastern Eashington was Kalle Ualla in

0"‘

1872. ‘Walla Walla Valley was favorably located on the Oregon Trail and

the Kullan Road ran northward from Fort‘Nalla'Nalla along the eastern

boundary of the present State of Hashington. By 1872 there was good river

transportation.by steamboat from the'?est Coast to wallula, Washington,

as
just west of Ealla'Halla but lreight rates were high. A short and very

local railroad line was being constructed between Eallula an"Walla'Ealla

while another short stretch served as.a portage at The Dallas on the

Columbia. There was also a primitive wagon road from'wallula to Colvill§#
Valley. As of 1872 it appeared reasonably certain that the Korthern Pacific Railroad Company would construct a rai_road thronwh the Territory of
K35hi38ton. The line was being built from Lake Superior to the test Coast
and the railroad‘s location.nap in l872 showed the line passing through

eastern Eashington some 50 to 60 miles south of the nearest of the subject

tracts.

One issue raised by the parties to this action should be

viewed before discussing the valuations of the respectiv tracts. all of
the tracts have either the Columbia or Okanogan rivers adjoining than as

211

7 Ind. Cl. Costs. 18'?

one of their boundaries. Petitioners‘ emerts  cozrzpnting the acreages
of the subject tracts included the land under the water of the rivers to
mid-stream. The addition of the water area increases the total acreage
of the several tracts by 17,2237 acres. The Coztznission has excluded the
water area and has accepted the computation of the acreage for the several
tracts as set forth by dei‘endant (Finding ED) for several reasons. The
land under water would not be saleable. As with the waste lands involved
in the subject tracts 1: .ich had little or no value, and had no value
applied to them ‘Dy petitioners‘ appraiser (see Pet. Proposed Fdg. 1:3);

the water area would. smilarly be considered in an appraisal approach where
the standard to be applied is the fair ‘:r_ar‘;::et va__ue of the lands and an
average price per acre is set for a given tract taking into consideration
all the factors pertaining to value. In erg-' event it: is not possible to
tell fr ... the record in what land classification petitioners‘ experts included the water area. apparently the lands under water are not classed

as waste lands. The water area for the Colville Tract would have totaled

Prop. Fdg. L13 and footnote lb to Pet. Prop. Fdg. 8). It is true, however,
that the fact that these several tracts *.-.-‘ere favorably located. with parts
of each located on the rivers crlfanced. their value and this fact has been

 consi:Zerati_o:t in arriving at the valuations of the tracts

(Fdg. 73).

into consideration the differences ‘oetzireen the soil experts and the strong
