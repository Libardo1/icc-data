OPINION

I Join in the interlocutory order herein to the extent that it
dismisses the first, second, fifth, sixth and. seventh causes of action
and an-:a.rd.s'the plaintiff $55lL,589.85 on theithird. cause of action, however,  cannot assent to the award of1‘$621L,1+68.55 on the claim set
forth in the fourth cause of action for the reasons I shall now state.

The fourth claim is for the difference between the value of the
land. of plaintiff situate in Nebraska, which they ceded. ‘by the treaty
of March 15, 18514, 10 Stat. 1038, and. the purchase price the Government paid. therefor.

The historical ha.ckg'ou.nd. of the claim is set forth in the Eindings
of met ‘by which it is shown that ‘by the treaty of July .15, 1830, 7 Stat.
328, I1 Kapp. 305, the Otoes and Missourias joined with several other

tribes in ceding and. relinquishing to defendant a large area of land

lying in Iowa, along and easterly of the Missouri River. Neither the

treaty nor the evidence shows the area occupied by plaintiffs, or
claimed by them, but Article I of the 1830 treaty, after ceding and
relinquishing all the Iowa lands of the several tribes, including
those of plaintiff, contains this provision; “Bit it is understood
that the lands ceded and relinquished by this Treaty, are to be assigned and allotted under the direction of the President of the United
states, to the Tribes now  thereon, or to such other Tribes as
the President may locate thereon for hunting, and other purposes."
Thus, it appears that the several tribes, including plaintiff, reserved the right to have lands "assigned and allotted" to them, and
other tribes which say be located thereon, “for himting, or other
purposes." Whether any bf the ceded lands were ever allotted to the
plaintiff I do not know, but I do know that by the treaty of September
26, 1833, j stat. 3-I-31, other Tndians were placed on the najor part of
the lands in Iowa, coded by the lS3O treaty. wane it appears that

plaintiffs were located on the west side of the Missouri and on lands

lying between the Big Nemaha and 15_Iorth Platte Bivers at the time of
the 1830 treaty, I find nothing indicating a relingiishment of their
rights in the Iowa lands reserved to them by Article I of the 1830
treaty until the relinquishment -thereof in 1851!-.

By the treaty of March 15, 18514-, 10 Stat. lO38, plaintiffs ceded
to defendant “all their country west of the Missouri river" (Art. 1),
and by Article 3, plaintiffs. “relinquish to the United States, all
claims, for money or other thing, under former. treaties, and all claims

which they my have heretofore, at any time, set up, to any land on the

east side of the Missouri river."

Obviously, the reference to land
on the "east side of the Missouri river" was the Iowa land in which
plaintiffs retained the right to have at least a part thereof asaigned and allotted to them "for hunting, and other purposes." What
the Kclaims for money or other thing, under former treaties" were
does not appear. At any rate, defendant and the plaintiffs considered the land claim and claims under former treaties of importance,
for by Article 4 the consideration therein set forth was expressly
stated to be in "payment for the country herein ceded and the relinquishments herein made. No separation.was made of the amounts

_ to be paid as the consideration for the Nebraska lands ceded or of

the amount to be paid for the relinquishments above mentioned, either

in the treaty or shown by the evidence, so it is impossible to tell
what part 6f the consideration was for the cession and what was for
the relinquishment, but we must assume that part of the consideration
was for the relinquishment of rights in the Iowa land and rights
under former treaties.

The Commission by its finding 12 (3) states that the total consideration paid for the cession of the hebraska land and for the relinquishment of plaintiffs‘ rights in the Iowa lands was $463,423.74,
and also, that there is no evidence to show what part, if any, was
for the telinquishment of the plaintiffs’ claim to the lands east.
of the Missouri River, but treats the entire amount expended for
the Indians under the 1854 treaty as the consideration for the cession
of the Nebraska lands (PD. 10, ll, 12 of Opinion) and on that basis

makes the award on the Fourth Cause of Action in the amount of

$62u,1+68 .55 .

The plaintiffs concede that it is impossible to determine what
portion of the consideration stated in the 1851; treaty was for the
ceded lands west of the Missouri (in Nebraska), and what part was for
the relinquishment of their rights in the lands lying east of the
Missouri (in Iowa), but they assume that a substantial part of it
went for the relinquishment, for they suggest that the commission
take an Iarbitrary figure! of one-third of $11-63,1L23.71L as consider-e
ation for the relinquishment. (pp. l1+8-9, plaintiffs‘ brief, and
proposed findings 18, 21, pp. 298-300 of brief.)

mhe Commission, as I have said, has considered the entire amount
paid the Indians umier the 1351; treaty, $1t63,1+23.7u, as the consideration for the cession of the Nebraska. lands. I think this is contrary
to the evidence and inconsistent with findings and opinion. We are
here dealing with the question as to whether the amount the Indians
received for their Nebraska land under the 1851} treaty was unconscionable. certainly the amount they received for the land they ceded is
necessary to determine that question. Merely for discussion, suppose
we take plaintiffs "arbitrary figure!‘ of $308,-9?-+9 .16 (proposed
finding 21 of plaintiffs! brief, p. 300) as the amount they received
for the Hebrash» cession valued by the commission at $1.00 per acre,
obviously, an entirely different problem would thus be presented
than that determined by the Comission insofar as unconscionable
consideration is concerned. Furthermore, the amount received for
the Nebraska lands mist be determined by the evidence and not based

upon an Ilarbitrary figure, I as plaintiffs suggest, or upon a finding

not supported by evidence, as I believe is the situation here. And it
would make no difference whether the ground of recovery is based upon

unconscionable consideration -- which the Commission doubts (Finding 17)

. or upon the ground, as the commission states, that “the payment of so

inadequate a consideration was unquestionably unfair and resulted in

an injustice to the plaintiff tribe” (Finding l'{), for in either case
the resulting award would be erroneous because of the ‘uncertainty or
impropriety of the amount deducted from the value for the consideration
paid in order to fix the amount the plaintiffs are entitled. 0

Again, but aside from the fact that there is no way under the

evidence to determine what the plaintiffs were paid for the Hebraska
land, I think the award is erroneous because the (commission did not
deem the value of the Blue River tract, comprising l62,lO'{ .71 acres
and lying outside the Nebraska area ceded by plaintiffs in 18534, a

part of the consideration forthat cession.
1h arriving at the eheuht of the award, $62l;,1:6e.55, the Commission found there were 1,250,000 acres of land ceded and it deducted
from this acreage the 162,107 .71 acres on the Blue River, leaving a
net of 1,087,892.29 acres valued at $1.00 per acre, and it then deducted from the value of this net acreage $1-i-63,)-1-23.7}-'r (being the total
sum of the expenditures made by defendant girsuant to Articles M, 5,

'{ and 12 of the 1851; treaty) and thereby arrived at the amount of the
award, In this way, the Commission, in effect, included the Blue
River tract as $1: of the consideration, although 11$ 16 clear}.
indicates that this land was not deemed a part of the consideration.

I would concede that if the value of the Blue River tract was

$1.00 per acre the Comissionts figures are correct, however, the method
used in reaching the result assumes an arbitrary value of $1.00 per acre
for the Blue River land. This, in my opinion, is an artificial value,
for there is no proof whatever as to the value of the _Blue River tract
as of the time plaintiffs acqiired it. There is proof though (Findings
18-20), that in the late 1870's and  lS80*s this same land was

sold -for nearly one million dollars. These sales do not, of course,

:1; the value as of 1351;, but indicate that the tract was of substantial

value when acqiired. But whether the value is more or less than $1.00

per acre is immterial, for in my judgment value must be based. on evidence and only in that way is there any legal basis for a finding ‘based.

thereon .

trhat I have said concerning the Blue River tract would not, of
course, solve aw basic objection to the award,’ even if the value of
the tract were proved, because the value of that tract, if added to
the amount the Comission found to be the consideration, would simply
show the total consideration paid for the cession of “the Nebraska. land
and the relinquishment of the reserved rights of plaintiffs in the Iowa
land and under treaties prior to 1851+. .
