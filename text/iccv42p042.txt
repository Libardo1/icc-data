PROCEDURAL

 

1. Identity and Capacity of the Plaintiffs. The Aleut Community of
St. Paul Island, plaintiff in Docket 352 (and 369), is a subdivision and

community within the Aleut Tribe, with an organization recognized by the
Secretary of the Interior as having authority to represent all of the
Community's members. The Community is a band of American.natives residing
on St. Paul Island, one of the Pribilof Islands of Alaska. The claim in
Docket 352 is asserted pursuant to the Act of August 13, 1946, 60 Stat.
1049, accrued prior to that date, and was timely filed before the Indian

Claims Commission.

Plaintiff in Docket 369 is the Aleut Tribe, et al., as captioned above.

The Aleut Community of St. George Island, as a constituent band of the Aleut
Tribe, presents its claim in Docket 369. The Aleut Community of St.
George is a lnnui of American natives residing on St. George Island, one
of the Pribilof Islands of Alaska, and has the authority to represent the
tribal interests of all the Community's members. The claim in Docket 369
is asserted pursuant to the Act of August 13, 1946, 60 Stat. 1049, and
accrued prior to that date. The claim was timely filed before the
Indian Claims Commission.
2. Consolidation of Claims for Trial. On July 18, 1975, the Indian

Claims Commission granted plaintiffs’ motion to sever the claim of the

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 44

Aleut Community of St. George Island from Docket 369 and consolidate
that claim for trial in Docket 352 (36 Ind. Cl. Com. 235).

3. Plaintiffs’ Claim. Plaintiffs contend that those members of
the Aleut Tribe residing on the Islands of St. Paul and St. George in
the yearsl870-1946, inclusive, were unfairly and dishonorably deprived
of the adequate compensation, housing, food, clothing, health facilities,
educational system, water supply, sanitation facilities, and related
services promised to them by the Act of July 1, 1870, l6 Stat. 180, and
the Act of April 21, 1910, 36 Stat. 326. Plaintiffs rest their claims on
section 2, clause 5 of the Indian Claims Commission Act, 60 Stat., at 1050.

4. Identity of Expert witnesses. The trial in this case was held
from May 24, 1976, through June 3, 1976. Several expert witnesses
testified for the parties. Testifying for plaintiffs were economists
Dr. Roger H. Willsie, Mr. Glenn B. Chadwick, and Dr. Herschel F. Jones,
members of the firm CHZM Hill, who were responsible for the preparation
of plaintiffs‘ exhibit 701. Also testifying for plaintiffs was Dr. William
S. Laughlin, anthropologist at the University of Connecticut and an

1/
honorary Aleut. Dr. Laughlin submitted p1aintiffs' exhibit L.

‘ll There are a number of articles in P1. Ex. L. Among those relied upon

are: "Secular Change and Isolate Divergence in the Aleutian Population
System," "A New View of the History of the Aleutians," "Aleut Settlement
Location and Distribution," "Eskimos & Aleuts: Their Origins and Evolution,"
and "Aleuts: Ecosystem, Holocene History, and Siberian Origin."

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 1 45

Testifying for defendant were Dr. Dorothy Jones, sociologist at the
University of Alaska, who wrote defendant's exhibit J; Dr. George W. Rogers,
economist at the University of Alaska, who wrote defendant's exhibit R;
and Dr. Allan G. Gruchy, economist at the University of Maryland, who was

responsible for the preparation of defendant's exhibit E-125.

HISTORICAL AND SOCIOLOGICAL
5. Origin and Migration of the Aleut People. Anthropologically, the
Aleuts are of a stock similar to the Eskimo. General external features
serve to link Aleuts and Eskimos. Aleut blood types are similar to those
of Eskimos and are significantly different from those of other American
Indian groups. The Aleut and Eskimo languages show similarities in certain
aspects of basic structure and vocabulary, but are not mutually intelligible.
It is believed that the Aleuts originally migrated to Alaska from

Siberia over the Bering Strait land bridge approximately 10,000 years ago.
Following the Alaska coast south these people eventually came to the
Aleutian Islands, an archipelago stretching over 1,100 miles from Port
Holler on the Alaskan Peninsula in the east to Attu Island in the west.

Migrations from the southern coast of Alaska to the Aleutians proceeded through

at least two waves, the latter of which was continuing at the time of the

Russian discovery of the islands in 1741.

6. Differences in Aleut Population. The Aleuts residing on the

Aleutians at the time of the Russian discovery were not a homogeneous

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 46

population group. There were western Aleuts associated with an early
migration, and the more recently arrived eastern Aleuts. The Russians,
perhaps aware of the two differing groups, brought only eastern Aleuts

to the Pribilof Islands.

7. Population, Environment,.and Food Sources on the Aleutians. The
pre-Russian Aleut population was approximately 16,000, a relatively dense
population for approximately 70 treeless islands of volcanic origin with
high, snow-covered mountains (some of which are still active volcanoes).
Vegetation on the islands is limited to grasses, lichens, small bushes,
and flowers, and there is no record of any substantial food crops being
grown.

Prior to the Russian discovery the Aleutians were an area teeming

with sea life. Sea mammals——hair and fur seals, sea lions, sea otters,

whales-—fish-—salmon, halibut, cod, smelt-—and sea—dependent invertebrates were abundant. Many birds also nested in the islands.

8. Cooperative Behavior of Aleut Comunities. The pre-Russian Aleut

villages exhibited cooperative behavior to a marked degree. Most important
village functions such as the sea hunt and warfare were treated as group
endeavors. Not only was the hunt for food a comunity enterprise, but
whatever food was caught was shared by the community as a whole, even in
times of famine.

9. Village Administration. Each Aleut village had one "headman"

whose primary function was to lead the community in its cooperative efforts,

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 47

but his authority also extended to other areas of organization and to
arbitration of disputes. The position of headman is not thought to have
been hereditary, nor did it confer special rewards to the holder.

10. Aleut Habitation and Transportation. At the time of the Russian
discovery Aleuts lived in small, partially subterranean sod and grass
dwellings known as barabaras. These dwellings were heated by small, stone,
oil-burning lamps and were well-suited to the cold, windy, wet, Aleutian
climate. The Aleut vehicle for sea hunting was the baidarka (a type of
kayak) which the Aleuts piloted with great skill. Aleuts were proficient
in marine technology and navigation.

11. The Aleutian Ecosystem. The Aleuts had a sophisticated culture
seemingly well-suited to the environment of the Aleutian Islands. The
male population prior to Russian contact had a longer life expectancy
than any subsequent Aleut population. The presence of Aleuts on the
islands was responsible for keeping the numbers of various marine animal
species relatively constant.

12. Discovery of the Aleutians. In 1741, Vitus Bering, sailing under
the Russian flag, sighted the Aleutians. Russians and other traders
followed Bering to the Aleutians and initiated a period of slaughter of
marine animals -- at first primarily the sea otter —- and mistreatment of
the Aleuts. Because the Aleuts were expert marine hunters the Russians
often employed Aleuts in marine hunts. The Aleuts resisted Russian
dominance for several decades but eventually were forced to accept Russian

hegemony.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 43

13. Discovery and Location of Pribilofs. In 1786, Gerasim Pribilof

became the first European to sight what are now known as the Pribilof
Islands. The two main islands, separated by 40 miles of sea, are St. Paul
and St. George. The islands lie near 57° north latitude (approximately
the same latitude as Moscow and Copenhagen, and far north of most major
American and Canadian cities) and 170° west longitude (directly south of
the easternmost tip of Siberia). The Pribilofs occupy a remote portion of
the Bering Sea, lying 214 miles northwest of Unalaska Island in the
Aleutians and 309 miles southwest of Cape Newenham on the Alaska mainland.
St. Paul and St. George are approximately the same size: St. Paul has

35 square miles, and St. George has 27 square miles.

14. Topography and Flora on Pribilofs. Both islands are of volcanic

origin, rocky with high sea cliffs, and with relatively high hill elevations.

There are several very shallow lakes, very little soil cover, and other
areas where sand dunes predominate. There is no record of any crop
production on the Pribilofs, and grasses, herbs, mosses, flowers, lichens,
and small bushes are the only types of vegetation.

15. Climatic Conditions. The climate in the Pribilofs is cold, cloudy,

 

windy, and wet. Colder than the Aleutians to the south, the average daily

high temperature is approximately 39°F.and the average low is approximately

32°F. Although the average yearly rainfall is not great, precipitation
occurs 200 or more days a year. There are about 274 days of heavy cloud

cover and the average wind speed 13 18.4 mph.

42 Ind. Cl. Com. 1 49

16. Pre—Russian Pribilofs. The Pribilofs were known to the Aleuts

 

prior to their discovery by Russia in 1786, but there were no inhabitants
on the islands in 1786, nor was there any record of previous settlements.

17. Comparative Disadvantages of the Pribilof Climate. The Pribilofs
constitute an inferior living environment for the Aleuts as compared with
the Aleutian chain. The Pribilofs are colder and ice conditions are
considerably more severe than in the chain. The Bering Sea freezes so
extensively that foxes can sometimes travel on ice from the Alaskan mainland to the Pribilofs. This ice makes winter fishing difficult and reduces
by a scouring effect the amount of kelp and seaweed on the shore.

18. Fresh water on the Pribilofs. Each island has several small,
shallow, fresh water lakes but no significant fresh water streams. The
lakes are a considerable distance from the settlements,and this makes it
difficult to obtain sufficient water for drinking and very difficult to
obtain the necessary amounts of water for bathing. The lack of fresh

running water decrees the absence of salmon and trout, two mainstays of

the Aleut diet.

19. Pribilof Coastline. From an Aleut viewpoint an important

deficiency of the Pribilofs is the lack of a complex coastline. The

Pribilofs, as compared with the eastern Aleutians, have smooth coastlines.

Thus, the islands lack the protected bays, protective reef systems, and

good harbors that provide plentiful and varied food sources. The Pribilofs

have such open, treacherous coastlines that landing periods for even an

Aleut baidarka are sometimes limited to only several hours per day.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 50

2G. Food Sources and Driftwood on the Pribilofs. The Pribii;fc are
isolated, forcing Aleuts to hunt in a restricted habitat. Although I‘%
presence of fur seals (callorhiaus urainus) provides the Aleuts with &
food source, the fur seal has not traditionally been the Aleuts' sole or
primary food source. Sea otter, sea lions, whales, and porpoises have
always been used by the Aleuts for food. Aleuts prefer many other kinds
of meat to fur-seal meat. The presence of fur-seals on the islands for
4 to 6 months each year makes it difficult for the Aleuts to use the
coastline and to collect the invertebrates, such as sea urchins, which are
traditionally a part of their diet. Very little driftwood,‘an essential
material for Aleut boats and homes, is found on the Pribilofs.

21. Settlement of the Pribilofs. Shortly after 1786 various Russian
traders brought Aleuts to the Pribilofs to kill and skin fur seals. Most
of these Aleuts came from the Fox Islands but some probably als; were
transported from the Atka Island area. At one time there were several
settlements on both St. George and St. Paul. It is probable that not all of
these settlements were continuously inhabited, however, since sealing was
suspended or greatly reduced, due to decreased seal herds, for significant

periods in the first half of the nineteenth century. There are indications
that the two main settlements, St. Paul on St. Paul Island and St. George on
St. George Island, were continuously inhabited for many years prior to the

sale of Alaska to the United States.

22. The First Charter of the Russian-American Co. In 1799 the

 

Russian Government gave the Russian-American Company a monopoly in fur

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 1 51

sealing and other commercial activity in the Bering Sea. The first

20-year charter of the Russian—American Company stressed the importance

of treating islanders (as Aleuts were called) amicably, but said little
concerning the political status of Aleuts or concerning any Aleut obligation
to work for the Russians. The Russian administrators, however, obligated
the Aleuts to work for the Company.

23. The Second Charter. In the second charter, granted in 1821,

Aleut men between 18 and 50 were obligated to serve the Russian-American
Company for 3 years. The Company often pressed Aleuts into service

for much longer than 3 years, however, giving them little more freedom
than slaves. The third charter of the Russian-American Company in 1844
did not change the Aleuts' political status.

24. Russian Herd Conservation. In the nineteenth century the Russians
recognized that herd conservation practices were necessary if the fur seal
was to survive on the Pribilofs. In 1808 and subsequent years, the kill
was limited to 40,000. In 1841 the kill on St. Paul was reduced to 8,000
per year. The Russians also instituted the practice of killing only 2

and 3 year-old male fur seals.

25. The Aleut Chief System and Russian Reliance on the Aleuts. The

Russians augmented the traditional chief system of the Aleuts by requiring
the chief to select one or two assistant chiefs. The chiefs were given
higher pay and treated with courtesy by the Russians. The Company had

to rely on Aleuts because of their unique hunting and processing skills

42 Ind. Cl. Com. 1 52

and because of the lack of Russians in Alaska, and especially in the
Pribilofs. In their non-Company fishing and hunting activities the
A1euts' community distribution of goods persisted.

26. Remuneration to the Aleuts Under Russian Administration. The

 

Russian—American Company kept account of amounts earned throughout the
year and at year's end distributed the money to the community. Shares
were determined by work classification. Work classification was
determined by type of work done. Women apparently worked at and were
compensated for seal hunting. Pribilof Aleuts probably earned more than
other Aleuts, and Veniaminov, a Russian priest who spent over 10 years

in Russian Alaska, considered the Pribilof Aleuts richer than other Aleuts.
However, more so than other Aleuts, those on the Pribilofs were forced to
trade with the Russians for the necessities of life. Prices at the
Company store were high, with the average profit margin estimated as 35
percent.

27. Effect of Russian Administration on the Aleuts. The Russian

 

administration left the Aleut population decimated while leaving the strong
imprint of Russian culture. Warfare, forced labor, and disease,reduced

the 1840 Aleut population to as little as one-tenth of their pre-contact
numbers. Under the encouragement of the Russians the Aleuts adopted the
Russian Orthodox religion. By the early nineteenth century many Aleuts
were baptized and took Russian christian and family names. Russian

Orthodox churches were built on St. Paul and on St. George.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 53

28. Aleut Learning. Under the supervision of the renowned Veniaminov
(later to become Metropolitan of Moscow) the Aleuts became literate in
their own language. Veniaminov finished th first Aleut language text in

1828. The Aleuts were quick learners and by 1860 a sizeable number could
read Aleut and speak both Aleut and Russian.

29. Aleut Mobility in the Russian Administration. In the latter
portion of the Russian administration Aleuts had a good deal of job
mobility and were trained in and held responsible positions. Aleuts were
sent to school in Sitka (the Russian administrative center of Alaska in
the Alaskan panhandle) and in Amchitka (Siberia). Aleuts became ship
navigators and captains, bookkeepers and priests. Many ships of the
Russian-American Company were built in Alaska with native labor. Many
Creoles (half Russian, half Aleut) held positions of authority, up to and
including Administrator General of the Russian-American Company.

30. Sealing in Final Years of Russian Administration. There are
no accurate figures for fur seals killed in the last years of Russian
sovereignty. It is probable, however, that the fur seal population, and
the annual kill, were growing as a result of the restrictive killing
measures instituted by the Russians in the 1830's. A large number of
Seals may have been killed in 1867 in anticipation of the change in
sovereignty.

31. Treaty of Cession. Beset by financial problems and international

considerations, Russia, in the Treaty of Cession, ratified May 30, 1867,

42 Ind. c1. Comm. 1 54

sold Alaska to the United States for $7,200,000. Article 3 of the Treaty
defines the status of inhabitants of the territory. All inhabitants, save
the uncivilized (or savage) tribes, were to be accorded American citizenship.
The general policy of the United States was to treat the Pribilof Aleuts
as non—c1tizen aboriginals until the Act of June 2, 1924.

32. Free Trade Period. From 1868 through the first portion of 1870
was a free trade period, with various commercial companies paying the
Aleuts 25-40 cents per seal skin. This sealing was carried out in
contravention of section 6 of the Act of July 27, 1868 (15 Stat. 539L by
which the Government prohibited the killing of fur seals. Estimates of

the seals killed in 1868 exceed 200,000.

33. Pribilofs as a Special Reservation. On March 3, 1869, Congress

declared the Pribilofs a special reservation (15 Stat. 348) thereby prohibiting the presence of private concerns on the islands. Revenue Marines
were assigned to the islands to enforce the prohibition on killing seals.
Over 85,000 seals were killed in 1869, however, as government officials

on the islands allowed the Aleuts to sell sealskins to traders for

necessities. In 1870 the seal kill was diminished markedly.

34. Primacy of the Pribilofs as Fur Seal Rookeries. Historically,

the Pribilof Islands were but one of many islands used as rookeries by the

fur seal. By 1870, however, depredations by man had greatly reduced the

number of commercially profitable fur-sealing rookeries. In the 1870's

the Pribilof fur seal catch constituted over two-thirds of those rookery—

42 Ind. C1. Com. l 55

killed seals sold on the London market. A relatively small percentage of

fur seals sold at London were killed on the open sea in the North Pacific

ocean and the Bering Sea.

35. Retention of Aleut Tribal Organization, 1870-1946. The Pribilof

Aleuts maintained some type of tribal organization during the entire
1870-1946 period. At the beginning of the first lease period the Aleuts

had a well—organized system of government, under chiefs of their own
selection. The focal point of tribal organization was the role of the
chief. Even though the lessees and government agents interferred in Aleut
government in progressively greater degrees as time went on (even appointing
what the Government considered to be the "Chief"), the Aleut chief system
continued in some form until about 1920. Thereafter, the "Foreman" and

the President of the Community Council carried duties approximating that

of the Chief. In 1946, for example, the President of the Community Council
led a strike for higher wages.

36. Retention of Comunity Distribution of Income, 1870-1946. Throughout the 76-year period in question the Pribilof Aleuts carried on sealing

as a group endeavor and income from sealing was distributed on a comunity
basis. Income from the taking of foxes was also generally distributed on

2/
a community basis. Portions of the communities’ income were distributed

-—'—*'1* 

3/ On St. George, where most foxes were taken, there was a distribution of
fox income. On St. Paul, where income from taking foxes was much smaller

and thus less importan;, zhere frequently was no comunity distribution -men simply received paymen. for the foxes they themselves caught.

A2 Ind. C1. Com. 1 55

to individual Aleuts in the form of shares. The largest shares went to

men mat skilled in sealing. Shares were also appropriated to support the
priest (when not otherwise supported), to maintain the church, to help pay
for certain community buildings, to assist widows and orphans (the lessees

and the Government also supported widows and children at times), and to

pay for other minor community needs.

37. Aleut Population of the Pribilofs, 1870-1946. The total Aleut
population in the Pribilofs in 1870 was 372. Thereafter the population

dipped, rose, and then began a significant decline that was to last for

nearly 20 years. The reason for the overall decrease in population was
0 

the extremely high death rate in the Pribilofs. The crude death rate
on St. Paul was four times greater than that of Massachusetts (a state
with reliable figures for the period). St. George's crude death rate

was three times that of Massachusetts. The death rate was so high that
4/

even an above average birth rate and some migration to the islands— could

not check the decline.

Aleut population decreased in the first 5 years of the second

lease period (1890-95), then began a gradual increase. The increase in

3/ Crude death rate equa1s.2EEEE§____.x 1,000.

" Population

3] St. Paul had a net migration gain during the period and St. George had

a net migration loss. St. Paul's migration gain was greater than St. George's
migration loss. There was undoubtedly some migration from St. George to

St. Paul but it is not known if this comprised the bulk of migration to
St. Paul. Some migration was due to men bringing in wives from other areas.

A2 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 57

population was due to an increased birth rate, migration, and a lowered
crude death rate. The crude death rate, however, remained far higher than
that of Massachusetts.

Aleut population slowly increased in the government period until
finally, in 1930, it reached the 1870 population level. Crude death rates
generally decreased, but in the 1940's these rates remained twice as high
msthose in the United States. An example of the extremely high death
rate on the Pribilofs is that in 1887, 46 of the 68 St. Paul male workers
alive in 1870 had died. Concern was expressed that the Pribilof Aleuts
umuld not survive. In contrast, no white person died in the Pribilofs in
the 1867-1887 period.

38. Life Expectancy in the Pribilofs, 1870-1946. The Pribilof Aleuts
run only had a lower life expectancy under American rule than in the precontact and Russian periods, but also had a lower life expectancy than
their Aleut contemporaries living on the Aleutian chain. For the period
em a whole, infant mortality was a major problem and those who survived
infancy did not live to old age. Even though the death rates were
declining for some groups as the 76-year period ended, the life expectancy
for those Pribilof Aleuts in the reproductive ages was not appreciably

tmtter than their counterparts in the 1870-1910 period.

39. Economic Rights of the Aleuts, 1870-1909. Pribilof Aleuts had

to work and had to work solely for the operators of the sealskin trade.

There is no record of any Aleut successfully refusing to labor, nor is

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 58

there any indication that any Aleut could or did maintain himself on the
islands independent of the sealskin trade. The Pribilof comunities existed
only to harvest seals and Aleuts could not survive on the islands without
outside assistance.

The Government denied the Aleuts on the islands the right to bargain
over conditions of employment. Work stoppages were dealt with sumarily.
Aleuts were prohibited from trading with any person other than the sealskin
operators. To ensure compliance, the islands were declared "special

H

reservations, thus allowing only government—authorized personnel on the

islands.

40. Restriction on Pribilof Aleuts' Freedom to Move — 1870-1909.

 

Aleuts were constrained in their freedom to move by the fact that the
government agents‘ permission was required to leave or reenter the islands.
Since the paramount concern of the Government was the retention of a
productive sealing force on the islands, the agents wielded their enormous
power to discourage Aleut emigration. The geographical isolation of the
Pribilofs, their lack of communications with the rest of the world, and
the lack of any commercial transportation to or from the islands added to
Aleut difficulties in moving, and increased their dependence on the wishes
of the Government.

41. Emergence of In-Kind Compensation for Aleuts - 1890-1909. In
the second lease period Aleuts wages were dispensed almost exclusively in

in—kind payments. Aleuts received credit at the Company store, where they

42 Ind. Cl. Com. 1 59

were severely restricted in the type and quantity of goods they could select.
This procedure continued in the government period.

42. Economic Rights of the Aleuts, l9lO—l946. The Aleuts' economic

position remained virtually unchanged in the period of government control.
Aleuts had to work for the Government, could not sell their labor on the
open market, and had no bargaining rights. The Aleuts were able to open a
canteen over which they exercised a measure of control.

While workers in the United States acquired job-related benefits,the
Pribilof Aleuts acquired none. Because they were federal employees, Pribilof
Aleuts were considered ineligible for minimum wage, hour, unemployment,
retirement, and disability benefits gradually afforded workers during this
period. However, the Aleuts were also excluded from benefits -- workmen's
compensation, retirement and annual leave -- afforded federal employees.

In contrast to the increasing numbers of women entering the labor
force in the United States at this time, there were virtually no job
opportunities for women in the Pribilofs.

43. Restriction on Pribilof A1euts' Freedom to Move, 1910-1946.
Government agents continued to discourage Aleut emigration in this period.
The Government's interest in keeping the Pribilof Aleuts intact as a
labor force is shown during World War II. After Aleuts were evacuated
from the Pribilofs in 1942, the Superintendent of the Bureau of Fisheries

wrote to the United States Employment Service requesting the placement of

working Aleuts in units as large as possible in isolated areas because

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 60

”[w]e [the Bureau] believe that we can keep better control over the Natives
if we had 15 men at one location rather than 3 men at each of 5 locations."

The Bureau of Fisheries apparently refused requests by some Aleuts at the

evacuation center to leave to look for work elsewhere.

44. Government Agents’ Authority on the Pribilofs, 1870-1946. The
authority of government agents on the Pribilofs was virutally unlimited.
Agents could summarily fine and incarcerate Aleuts. There was one
instance in which an agent exiled a Pribilof Aleut from the islands.
Agents interferred in the system of Aleut government and even decided the
types and quantities of goods Aleuts could purchase. By the latter part

of the government period, the government agent was the integral part of a

system that controlled nearly every aspect of the Pribilof Aleuts lives.

45. World War II Evacuation. In June 1942 the Aleuts of St. Paul
and St. George were evacuated to Funter Bay in southeastern Alaska. No
sealing was conducted in 1942, but in 1943 sealing gangs returned to the
islands and a large number of seals were taken. In May 1944 the Pribilof
Aleuts were brought back to the islands.

46. Conditions at Funter Bay. Living conditions in the Aleut
evacuation center at Funter Bay were extremely unhealthy. An assistant
supervisor of the Fish and Wildlife Service wrote on October 28, 1943,
that unless conditions improved before the winter "it is more than a
possibility that the death toll from tuberculosis, pneumonia, influenza,

and other diseases will so decimate the ranks of the natives that few

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 1 61

will survive to return to the islands." The same supervisor reported the

criticism of a physician that "the Aleuts were herded into quarters unfit
for pigs, denied adequate medical attention; lack of healthful diet and
even facilities to keep warm and are virtually prisoners of the Government

though theoretically possessing the status of citizenship."

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST LEASE PERIOD, 1870-1839

47. The Act of July 1, 1870. On July 1, 1870, Congress passed an

act (16 Stat. 180) allowing, inter alia, the leasing of the right to take

   

fur seals on the Pribilofs. Theuact set minimum acceptable remuneration
to the Government from such a lease at $50,000 annual rental and $2 per
skin as revenue tax. The lease would be for 20 years and proceeds would
go into the Treasury. The kill was restricted to 75,000 per year on
St. Paul and 25,000 per year on St. George, except for those seals which
the Pribilof Aleuts required for food, clothing and boat—bui1ding. In the
making of the lease the Secretary of the Treasury was instructed to "have
due regard to the preservation of the seal fur—trade of said islands, and
the comfort, maintenance, and education of the natives thereof" (§4). In
56 the Secretary was authorized to "make all needful rules and regulations. . . for the comfort, maintenance, education and protection of
the natives of said islands."

48. The Alaska Commercial Company's Lease. In 1870 the Alaska
Commercial Company (hereinalter the ACC), successor to Hutchinson, Kohl,
and Co., was granted the lease to take Pribilof fur-seals amid charges

that the company engaged in bribery and other improper inducements.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 5

49. Provisions of the ACC Lease. The lease signed by the ACC and
the Secretary of the Treasury provided that the company was to pay an

annual rental of $55,000, a $2 revenue tax on each fur—seal skin

taken and shipped, an additional 62 1/2 cents for each furuseal eazw, and

5/

55 cents per gallon of fur-seal oil obtained for sale. All theae monies
were to be paid into the U. 8. Treasury.

The lease also provided that the Pribilof Aleuts were to re.e;ve free
of charge 25,000 dried salmon, 60 cords of firewood, sufficient quantities

of salt, and a number of barrels to preserve meat. The ACC agreed to abide

by all regulations for the comfort, maintenance, education, and protection

of the natives.

50. Few Regulations Issued bx the Secretary of Tresourv. Prior to

the awarding of the lease to ACC, the Secretary of the Treasurv stated that
the eventual lessee would be required to establish schools on St. Paul and

St. George and would be required "to pay to the natives n: the islands for

the labor performed by them such compensation as may be “ecessarv for their
proper support, under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the

Treasury." Although few regulations were made by the Qecretarv of the

Treasury, one was the requirement that the ACC use onlv Pribilof Aleuts in

the seal killing and skinning operations.

_§/ The lease does not specifically term the c; :52 seats yer skin, or the
55 cents per gallon of seal oil, a"tax."

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 63

The Ace recognized Aleut native government, and the chiefs‘ right to

choose working parties.

51. Seal Harvesting Restrictions and Procedure. The Act of July 1,
1870, and the lease with the ACC prohibited certain types of sealing.
Female seals and all seals less than one year old could not be killed; the
killing was to occur in June through October, exclusively; and seal killing
in the waters adjacent to the islands was prohibited.

On the day of a seal kill the Aleut men would arise early and proceed
to the targeted rookery. In a selected area of the rookery Aleuts would

drive a group of seals away from the ocean. Then, allowing older seals and
female seals to escape, the group was herded to the killing ground. There
the seals were clubbed over the head and perhaps stabbed in the heart.
Skinning the seals proceeded immediately after killing. The whole

killing and skinning operation was a group enterprise involving men with
differing duties and levels of expertise. The extraordinary proficiency

of the Aleuts in this task is evidenced by the fact that in 50 days, 71 men

are reported to have killed and skinned 75,000 seals.

52. Curing and Transportation of Skins. After skinning, the skins
were cured for up to three weeks and then bundled. When the company ship
called at the islands the skins would be ferried out to the boat, since
there were no docking facilities on either St. Paul or St. George. The
skins were taken to San Francisco, thence to New York, and, prior to

1913, to auction in London.

42 Ind. c1. Comm. 1 5‘

S3. Aleut Remuneration in the First Lease Period. Aleut and
government revenue was primarily determined by the count of government
agents either when the skins were loaded aboard the company shiP at the
Pribilofs or upon delivery to the government agent at San Francisco.
Either pursuant to government regulation or on its own volition the ACC

set Aleut remuneration at 40 cents per seal skin.

54. Government of Pribilofs. The Secretary of the Treasury
administered the Pribilofs directly through the agents on St. Paul and

St. George; there were no intermediate officials.

55. ACC Employees and Store. The ACC initially employed 11 nonnatives on St. Paul -- an agent, three assistants, three carpenters, a
school teacher, a physician, a cooper and a cook —— and four non-natives
on St. George —— an agent, a physician, a teacher and cook. The ACC

maintained a store on each island; prices were set at not more than 25 percent above San Francisco wholesale prices.

56. Number of Seals Killed. Although the Act of July 1, 1870,
restricted the kill of seals to 100,000, and to the months of June, July,
September and October, another provision in the.act allowed Aleuts to kill
at other times such seals as might be needed for food, clothing and boat
manufacture (16 Stat. 180, §§1, 3). Since the number of seals taken for

food on St. Paul alone exceeded 10,000 at times, it was common in the

years 1871-1889 for more than 100,000 seals to be killed.

42 Ind. Cl. Com. 1 65

57. Selection of Sealskins to be Shipped. During the sealing season

the Aleuts engaged in seal harvesting that was specifically intended to be
applied toward the ACC's quota. A small percentage of the skins taken
were rejected by the ACC as unfit. At other times in the year the Aleuts

took seal pups and bachelor seals for food. Those sealskins from this kill

suitable for sale were taken by the ACC and applied toward the seal quota.

58. Sale of Sealskins on the London Market. Most, if not all, of

 

the sealskins harvested on the Pribilofs were shipped to London and sold

there. The best estimate of the number of Pribilof Islands’ sealskins
sold on the London market during the first lease period, from 1870 to
6/

1889, is 1,839,353.“. Total receipts from fur sales at the London market

1/
were $27,173,668.

59. Foxskin Catch; Sale of Foxskins; Revenue Therefrom. The ACC also
derived income from selling foxskins harvested on the Pribilofs. Although

the 1870 lease did not mention any revenue-producing activity other than

 

Q] This figure may not reflect total ACC Pribilof sealskin sales because
some ACC sealskins may have been sold after the termination of the lease
in 1889, and because a small quantity of sealskins may not have reached
London (see Pl. Ex. 25, at 110). For differing estimates see Pl. Ex. 33.
at 386; P1. Ex. 49, at 963.

2/ This is the figure in Def. Ex. G-1, Sch. 2-1. This compares with Henry
Elliott's estimate of $27,153,514 (Def. Ex. R, at 195) and plaintiffs‘ expert's
estimate of $29,473,060 (based on a chart in P1. Ex. 78)» The estimate of
$27,836,668 in Def. Ex. R, at 26, is too high for several reasons: (1)

Receipts of $82,552 are too high for the sealskins taken under the lease in
1870 (see Def. Ex. cs-1, at 10; Pl. Ex. 701, at A-10); (2) There is a

sealing, the ACC assumed the privilege of taking and selling foxskins.
Information on the number of skins and revenues derived from foxing in
the period 1870-1889 is incomplete. Both "blue" and "white" fox were
trapped, but the blue fox was much more highly prized and constituted
the overwhelming majority of foxes caught. St. George was the Primary

foxing area, and the catch there was several times as high as on

St.APaul.

60. Estimate of Foxskin Catch and Revenue. The best estimate of

the total fox catch over the 20-year period is 24,792, producing gross
revenues of $300,000f§/

61. Seal 011 Production. The ACC produced at least 32,000 gallons
of seal oil in the lease period, but there is no record of gross or net
revenues accruing to the ACC from the production of seal oil. The lease
with the Government called for a tax of 55 cents per gallon of seal oil
produced for sale by the ACC. In 1874, however, the solicitor of the

Treasury unilaterally waived this tax, and there is no record of any

monies paid to the Government pursuant to the seal oil tax.

 

8/ This estimate is based on Def. Ex. G—6 (upon which defendant's experts

rely in Def. Ex. G-1, at lO—ll,and Def. Ex. R, at 35-36) which is a
government document and the most complete record of faxing available.
Plaintiffs‘ expert estimates the total fox harvest for 1870-1889 at
17,875 (Pl. Ex. 721) and gross revenues at $158,193 (Pl. Ex. 701, at
6~5). See Def. Ex. E-49, at 965, fn. 2.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 67

62. Payments to Pribilof Aleuts for Sealing. The ACC paid Aleuts
9/

a total of $722,887 for killing and skinning seals. $596,056 was paid
10/
for sealing on St. Paul and $126,831 for sealing on St. George:—_

63. Payments to Pribilof Aleuts for Foxskins. Information on the

amount paid the Aleuts for each fox pelt indicates that blue fox pelts
brought either 50 cents per pelt or 40-60 cents per pelt and white fox
skins brought much less. White foxskina appear to constitute an insignificant portion of the total catch and these skins may not even be
included in catch data. Assuming an average price per skin of 50 cents
and a total catch of 24,792 (see findings of fact No. 60), the ACC paid

$12,396 to the Aleuts for faxing. This represents an income of $2,190 to

the St. Paul Aleuts, and $10,206 to St. George Aleuts.

64. Miscellaneous Pribilof Aleut Labor Expenditures. The ACC also

paid the Pribilof Aleuts for labor unconnected with the taking of seals.

This labor was usually compensated at the rate of 10 cents per hour.

The company also paid the natives small amounts for sea lion skins and

various other animal parts. St. Paul Aleuts earned $7,006 for miscellaneous
11/
labor. While St. George Aleuts may have earned money at miscellaneous

 

2/ Defendant's exhibit E-33 contains an erroneous total at page 262. The
total should be $126,830.80.

12/ Although $596,056 was paid for sealing on St. Paul, records indicate
that $25,780 of this total was paid to St. George men who had assisted

in the St. Paul sealing (Def. Ex. c—1, at 11; §gg_Def- Ex. 45. at 35 for 8
slightly lower estimate of fox earnings on St. Paul).

ggj Defendant's exhibit R has an incorrect total at page 35 for miscellaneous
labor on St. Paul in 1872. The figure should be $221.97 not $521-9742 Ind. c1. Comm. 1 53

work, no documentation is available to establish the existence of such
$2!
payment or its amount.

65. Donor Goods Provided by the ACC. The ACC was obligated under
the lease to provide the Aleuts with dried salmon, 60 cords of wood,
salt, and barrels to preserve meat. However, the ACC in 1871 substituted
60 tons of coal for the wood and in 1873 substituted salted salmon for
dried salmon.

66. Value of Salmon Supplied. The best estimate of the dried
salmon, salt salmon and codfish supplied by the ACC under the terms of

the lease is $8,000. The ACC provided 80 barrels of fish per year. The
value for dried salmon per barrel from 1868 on, and the value for dry-salted
salmon from 1900 on};/are set forth in Bl.Ex. 701, Vol. II, at 102. The
value of salmon during the first lease period was approximately $8 to

$9 per barrel. The value of dry-salted salmon after 1900 was approximately
$4 to $5. Since most of the salmon provided was dry-salted, an estimate

1h/
of $5 per barrel for fish supplied by the ACC is reasonable. This

indicates estimated expenditures of $400 per year and $8,000 for the

lease period.

 

_lg/ Defendant's expert in Def. Ex. R, at 36,estimates $1,200 per year as
miscellaneous labor payments to St. George Aleuts. However, as authority
for this estimation, there is apparently only one reference to a small
payment in 1872 (§gg_Def. Ex. E-45).

_l§/ There are no figures in the exhibit for the period prior to 1900.
lg] Plaintiffs estimate the value of the fish supplied at $8.55 per barrel

and $684.15 per year. Defendant's expert estimates that salt salmon cost
the ACC $3 per barrel (Def. Ex. R, at 40).

42 Ind. Cl. Com. 1 59

67. Value of Coal Provided. The cost to the ACC of the coal

 

provided is conjectural but may be estimated at $780 per year or $15,600
($10,400 for St. Paul, $5,200 for St. George) for the lease period. Both
parties agree that the price per ton of coal at the St. Paul store in
1900 was $15.50. Neither party sets Forth any reason why coal prices
should have been substantially higher or lower in the 1870-1889 period.
Therefore, taking $15.50, the store price in 1900, and deducting 25 per~

cent for allowed markup over San Francisco price, leaves an estimated
15/

cost per ton of approximately $13:_*

68. Value of Salt and Barrels Provided. Although records show

 

that the ACC did provide salt and barrels to the Pribilof Aleutsg the
quantity of these items supplied is unknown. The cost to the ACC was
insignificant and no value has been estimated for these supplies.

69. Value of Medical Care to Pribilof Aleuts. Although not required

to do so by the lease arrangement, the ACC stationed a doctor and a supply

of free medicine on each island. Assuming that doctors‘ salaries in the

 

£§/ Plaintiff maintains that the known cost of coal in the Pribilofs in
1888 was $20 per ton (Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at 3-13), and marshalls certain
authority in the record that indicates that the retail price of coal was
at various times in the $20 range (P1. Ex. 31, at 27; P1. Ex. 123, at 32;
Pl. Ex. 53, at 209). Plaintiffs‘ expert's worksheet (Pl. Ex. 719, at 2),
however, estimates the price per ton at $15 for the period 1880 to 1889.
The same worksheet states that observed prices in l891xwere $15 per ton.
Defendant's expert speculates that the cost per ton of coal to the ACC

was $7.

42 Ind. c1. Comm. 1 70

first lease period were approximately the same as the $1,200 per year per
doctor paid in the second lease period (see finding of fact No. 97). and
assuming that $300 of medicine was dispensed per island per year, a total
of $3,000 per year was expended for health services. During the 20year lease period this would mean an ACC expenditure of $60,000.

70. Other Expenditures to the Pribilof Aleuts. Other expenditures
to the Pribilof Aleuts are not estimated. Although the ACC did provide
some school instruction, the expense to the company was probably minimal.
There are no records of expenses for school supplies and the "teacher"
may have been a regular employee of the ACC mre concerned with the seal
harvest than with teaching.

The ACC expended some funds in the first lease period for support
of Pribilof widows and orphans, but the amount of money so spent was
probably very low, and the ACC and the Government were often at odds

over the ACC lack of support for this segment of the population. Often

the Aleuts themselves had to support widows and orphans.

71.‘ Non—Pribilof Aleut Labor. The ACC also hired outside labor to
work on St. Paul. Unalaska Aleuts made up this work force which was
primarily engaged in extra sealing—re1ated labor during the sealing
season. The first record of Unalaska workers on St. Paul is 1878.
Additional records exist for 1879, 1881, and 1889. Any 20-year total
for this labor must be an approximation. Data on the years 1878 and 1879

indicates mnthly wages from $30 to $40 for Unalaska labor. Total wages

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 71

paid (for making seal oil) are listed at $1,022.92 for 1878, and
$1,110.00 for 1879. Assuming an average of 20 Unalaskan workers from
1878-1889, pay of $40 per month, and average employment of 6 weeks
(a major portion of the killing season), yearly wages are $1,116.00.
Taking average wages for 10 years and adding them to the 2 years in
which wages are known, gives total wages to non-Pribilof Aleuts as
$13,293.

The ACC may also have provided board to the Unalaskans while on
St. Paul, but this amount must have been very small and is not estimated.

72. Salaries, Transportation, Offices. The ACC had to pay other
costs which for the year 1872 Henry Elliott, a one-time government agent
and author of reports on the Pribilof Islands seal trade, listed as follows:

Salaries of island agents & white assistants, etc. $ 24.000

Steamer (in commission 5 months) 25,000
Salaries of agents & office force, San Francisco 12,000
Salaries of Washington attorney & agent 6,000
Wharfage, packing, casks, San Francisco 2,000
Fast freight, San Francisco to New York, 8 cars 1,600
Insurance from islands to London 7,000

Steamer freight and transshipment New York to
London, etc. 1.400
Brokerage, dock charge, London sales 15,000
Total $ 94,000

There is no verification for these figures and the figures, even

if correct, reflect only one year's expenditures. The figures do provide,

however, the best available approximation of ACC costs. Applying these

costs over the 20-year period results in an expenditure of $1,880,000.

42 Ind. c1. Com. 1 73

73. Building Acguisition and Construction Egpenditures. Records

indicate the ACC paid $28,051 to Hutchinson, Kohl and Co. for the various

structures existing on the islands. In addition, the ACC spent approximately

$18,000 on Aleut housing. The total of these two expenditures is $46,051.

74. Payment to the U. S. Government. The ACC paid the Government
$6,010,566 in the first lease period. For the year 1870 the ACC paid the

Government a rental of $5,480.75, a tax of $1 for each sealskin remaining

on the islands but taken prior to the effective date of the lease, and a
tax of $2.625 for each sealskin taken during the lease period. From 18711889 the ACC paid $55,000 in rental and $2.625 for each sealskin shipped

from the Pribilofs.

75. Total Expenditure and Net Profit to the ACC. The ACC's

expenditures during the first lease period are as follows:

(1) Pribilof Aleuts for sealing $ 722,887
(2) Pribilof Aleuts for foxing 12,396
(3) Pribilof Aleuts for misc. labor 7,006
(4) Cost of salmon provided 8,000
(5) Cost of coal provided 15,600
(6) Non~Pribilof Aleuts for labor 13,293
(7) Cost of ACC salaries, transportation, offices 1,880,000
(8) Cost of health services provided 60,000
(9) Cost of building acquisition from Hutchinson,
Kohl & Co., cost of erecting houses 46,051
(10) Payments to U. S. Government 6,010,566

Total $8,775,799

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 1 73

Total expenditures are $8,775,799, total receipts are $27,473,668

(findings of fact Nos. 58 and 60), resulting in net profit to the ACC,
16/

from 1870-1889, of $18,697,869.-'

76. Revenues and Expenditures of the U. 3. Government. The Government
17/

was paid $6,010,566 by the ACC under the 1870 lease. There is no record
of the Government directly assisting in sealing operations in the Pribilofs.
The Government did station agents on the islands, however, and the Government

did make certain expenditures related to the fur-sealing industry.

16/ This estimate of net profit compares to Henry Elliott's estimate of
$l8,753,9ll.20 (Def. Ex. E-49, at 964), defendant expert's estimate of
$18,102,140 (Def. Ex. R, at 30), and.plaintiffs'expert's profit estimate
of $17.8 to $20.4 million. Plaintiffs’ estimate, however, is based on the
assumption that the ACC made substantial profits on1y:hn its Pribilof
operations (Pl. Ex. 701, at 6-6). This has not been shown. Rather, the
record discloses that beginning in 1871 the ACC held a lease to kill fur
seals on the Russian Komandorskiye (Comander) Islands (P1. Ex. 25, at 92)
(lying approximately 165° east longitude, 55° north latitude) and that
under advantageous lease provisions, the ACC killed and sold 720,406 fur
seals (Pl. Ex. 700, at 151) and 17,409 foxskins (Def. Ex. G-6, at 4)
between 1872 and 1890. Although profit calculations are not possible,

the volume of skins taken should have yielded a very substantial return to

the ACC (Pl. Ex. 25, at 111). The ACC also had a substantial, and a probably
profitable, presence elsewhere in Alaska.

11/ In addition to the Government revenue under the 1870 lease plaintiff's
expert contends that an estimated additional $2,844,857, collected as
duties on sealskins, should be counted as profit to the Government (P1. Ex.
701, Vol. I, at 6-12). These estimated duties were collected on sealskins
that were imported into the United States after processing in London.
Plaintiffs‘ expert's calculations are based solely on a chart submitted by
a witness for the ACC at an 1889 Congressional hearing (P1. Ex. 25, at 99).
Plaintiffs’ expert assumes an average price for imported skins of $78.93
and a duty of 20 percent per skin. Plaintiffs also estimate as Government
expenses 5 percent of the amount collected, or $188,587, to give a net
return from duties of $2,656,270.

77. Government Agents‘ Salaries. The best estimate of agents’
salaries and expenses in the first lease period is $152,517. —_- Government agents appear to have been well-paid in the first lease period.

Salaries of the chief agents often exceeded $3,000 (including traveling

expenses). It is not known if in addition to this salary agents received
room and board.

78. Cost of Government Buildings. The cost of Governmentbiéldings
on the Pribilofs was small. The best estimate of cost is $5,940:—_

79. Governmental Research on Fur Seals and Fur Trade. Def. Ex. E—42,

 

at 42 lists $784.51 spent in 1875 for "collecting information respecting

fur trade." No other sums are listed for research on the Aleuts or fur

seals.

80. Government Expenditures for General Patrol of Alaska. $183,808.62

was expended by the Government for patrol and administration of Alaskan

18/ Def. Ex. E—42, at 42, and Def. Ex. G-l, at 9 have substantially the
same figures per year, the difference in totals primarily due to the
inclusion of salaries and expenses for fiscal 1890 in Def. Ex. G-l.
Excluding fiscal 1890, and otherwise relying upon Def. Ex. E-42, results
in agents’ salaries and expenses of $152,517. Other estimates are:
$152,482 (in P1. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at 6-13), $166,784 (in Def. Ex. G-1,
at 9), and $202,655 (in Def. Ex. R, at 28 and Def. Ex. E-75, at 1).

See also Def. Ex. G-3, at 7.

but arrives at a higher figure (Def. Ex. R, at 28). Def. Ex. G-1, at 9,

also has a higher total, one not consistent with Def. Ex. G-3, at 104,

waters and marine areas in the first lease period. A description of the

use of the monies appropriated for the "protection of sea-otters and seals"
in Alaska illustrates that a sizeable portion of the appropriation was
intended for activities unrelated to the sealing operations. A typical
description of an appropriation commits the monies "[t]o enable the
Secretary of the Treasury to use revenue—steamers for the protection of

the interests of the Government of the seal islands, the seal-otter
21/

hunting grounds, and the enforcement of the provisions of law in Alaska."

Although the revenue cutters did, in part, help enforce sealing laws
and regulations, other activities were numerous and much more time-consuming.
A chronologica1.list of the activities of the revenue cutter Corwin in 1884

shows the diverse responsibilities of the Revenue Cutter Service. In 1888

the Secretary of the Treasury was unable to approximate the amount expended

by the revenue marine on the seal islands because the revenue cruisers

39/ A Congressional hearing in 1888 indicated that for the years 1877-1887
$163,808.62 was the cost of revenue cutters and naval vessels in Alaska.

A further appropriation of $20,000 in 1888 brings the total for the lease
period to $183,808.62. The General Services Administration report includes
both $183,808.62 and $600,000 as Government patrol expenses even though a
witness for the GSA testified that the GSA did not know if one figure was
inclusive of the other (Tr. IV, at 41). Both the GSA figure of $606,846.66
and Def. Ex. R figure of $600,000 are based, without further substantiation,
upon Henry Elliott's estimate that $30,000 per year was expended on the

seal trade (see Def. Ex. E-49, at 964).

A later government document that sets forth receipts and expenditures of

the fur seal fisheries does not include the $183,808.62 in the main table,

but instead footnotes the figure with the explanation that the money "had
23/

little or nothing to do with the seal islands.” The Commission finds

that the amount expended by the Government to protect the Pribilof Island

sealing operations was small and not subject to quantification.

81. Government Profit, First Lease Period. In the 1870-1889 period

payment by the ACC to the Government was $6,010,566 and expenditures

totalled $159,242. Profit was $5,851,324.

shipped sealskin was increased to $9.625. In addition the Government was

to receive 50 cents for each gallon of seal oil sold by the lease.

The second lease, like the first, obligated the lessee to provide
coal, salmon, salt, and barrels to the Aleuts. The second lease, increased,
however, the amount of coal to be provided from 60 to 80 tons per year and
left to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury the amounts of

dried salmon, salt, and barrels to be provided.

84. Additional Obligations of the Lessee Under the Second Lease. The

_ second lease provided that the NACC was to furnish to the Pribilof Aleuts

. . . a sufficient number of comfortable dwellings in
which said native inhabitants may reside; and will keep
said dwellings in proper repair; and will also provide

and keep in repair such suitable schoolhouses as may be
necessary, and will establish and maintain during eight

months of each year proper schools for the education of
the children on said islands, the same to be taught by
competent teachers who shall be paid by the company a
fair compensation, all to the satisfaction of the
Secretary of the Treasury; and will also provide and
maintain a suitable house for religious worship; and will
also provide a competent physician or physicians, and
necessary and proper medicines and medical supplies; and
will also provide the necessaries of life for the widows

and orphans and aged and infirm inhabitants of said
islands who are unable to provide for themselves; all of

which foregoing agreements will be done and performed by
the said company free of all costs and charges to said

native inhabitants of said islands or to the United
States. . .

O C O O

The said company further agrees to employ the native

inhabitants of said islands to perform such labor upon the
islands as they are fitted to perform, and to pay therefor

42 Ind. c1. Comm. 1 73

a fair and just compensation, such as may be fixed by the

Secretary of the Treasury; and also agrees to contribute,
as far as in its power, all reasonable efforts to secure
the comfort, health, education, and promote the morals and

civilization of said native inhabitants.

85. Quote of Seals Allowed to be Taken. The lease placed a quota

of 60,000 on the number of seals the NACC could kill in the year ending
May 1, 1891. The lease established no limit on the seal kill thereafter,
but the Secretary of the Treasury held the power to restrict the kill.

86. Decrease in the Seal Herd. By 1890, there was a dramatic
decrease in the size of the Pribilof seal herd as compared with its
number a decade earlier. This decrease was in part due to the prolific
growth of pelagic sealing. From a modest beginning in the 1860's, pelagic
sealing had increased substantially in the 1880's, and by the 1890's the
number of seals taken at sea far outnumbered those taken on the Pribilofs.

87. Government Administration of the Pribilofs in the Second Lease

 

Period. Until 1903 the Treasury Department continued to administer the

Pribilofs. In 1903 the administration of the islands was transferred to
the Department of Commerce and Labor. In both instances the chief agent
on the islands reported directly to the Secretary. In 1909 the Bureau

of Fisheries, within the Department of Commerce and Labor, was given

responsibility for administering the Pribilofs.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 79

88. Sale of Sealskins in London. In the second lease period, 1890 

1909, 339,180 sealskins were shipped to London and sold at the fur market

35/ .23]
there. These skins were sold for $9,489,728.

89. Foxskin Harvest and Sale. The record indicates that during the
second lease period approximately 7,652 foxes were taken on St. George and

2,671 were taken on St. Paul. There is little information available to
26/
establish the price the NACC received on the sale of foxskins.—— It is

33/ There is some substantiation for a slightly higher number of skins sold
during one of the years -- 1890 (P1. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at A-4; P1. Ex. 700,
at 151).

ggj The parties are in substantial agreement on the gross revenues derived
from the sale of sealskins (§ge_Def. Ex. R, at 71; Def. Ex. C-1, at lé;

P1. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at A~14). The General Services Administration figures
(Def. Ex. G—l) have been relied upon with two exceptions -~ the totals for
fiscal 1909 and 1910 have been recalculated using the product of the number
of sealskins shipped times the average price per skin, as listed in separate
columns of the GSA report. The products now listed for 1909 and 1910 by the
GSA do not equal the product of sealskin times price per skin. Def. Ex. R,
at 7l,uses the same revenue figures as the GSA report (with the exception

of one $6 deviation) but arrives at a different total because the column of

figures has been incorrectly added. Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. 1, is in near complete
agreement with defendant's experts‘ estimate of the number of seals sold and
the price per skin. Plaintiffs’ expert arrives at a higher total revenue
figure, however, by relying on other sources -- Pl. Ex. 78 and P1. Ex. 88,

at 107.

ggj Blue foxskins may have been selling from $12-$20 in the San Francisco
market early in the second lease period (Def. Ex. G-14, at 4). There is
no indication in the record, however, that the NACC sold foxskins in

San Francisco. Defendant's expert, relying upon 1888-1891 ACC sales,
calculates net revenues from each foxskin at $22.53 (and a $235,258 total
over the 1é§EE period) (Def. Ex. R, at 74). Plaintiff's expert estimates
$20 as the market price for blue fox and $12 as the market price for white
fox. This leads to an estimate of $204,488 for gross revenues.

42 Ind. 01. Comm. 1 80

apparent that foxskins were a valuable commodity at this time since several
private interests attempted to breed foxes on Alaskan islands for commercial
purposes.

A reasonable estimate of the price for foxskins is $22 for blue foxskins
and $15 for white foxskina. Indications are that white foxskins made up a
small percentage of those skins taken. Assuming all but 4 percent of the

foxskins were blue fox results in estimated total revenue of $230,400.,

90. Seal 011 Production. There is no record of seal oil being
produced by the NACC.

91. Payments to Pribilof Aleuts for Sealing. The best estimate for

amounts paid to Aleuts for sealing during the second lease period, 1890 to
27/
1909, is $184,275.

92. Payments to Pribilof Aleuts for Foxskins. Data on the amount
paid the Aleuts for fox pelts indicates that compensation was initially in
the $l—$2 range. Compensation was increased for the winter harvest of
1893-94to $5 for each first class blue fox, $4 for second class blue fox
and $1 for white fox. By 1900 Aleuts were paid $5 for all blue foxskins.
Total revenue to the Aleuts from the NACC was approximately $43,730.

$32,959 was paid to St. George Aleuts and $10,761 to St. Paul Aleuts.

 

_£Z/ Aleuts were paid 40 cents per seal skin in 1890. This was increased

$3020 cents per skin in l89l (Pl. Ex. 53, at 314) and 75 cents per skin in

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 31

93. Payments to Pribilof Aleuts for Miscellaneous Labor. While the

NACC probably paid the Aleuts small amounts each year for miscellaneous
labor, the only record of such payment is a $2,000 expenditure to St.

3§/
George Aleuts in 1895.

94. Value of Salmon Provided. The NACC was obligated to furnish as
much dried salmon as deemed necessary by the Secretary of the Treasury.
There is no record that the Secretary ever set any guidelines in regard to
dried salmon. The amount of salt and dried salmon provided was probably
much less than that furnished in the first lease period. The best estimate
of the value of the fish provided is $5,079.22!

95. Value of Coal Provided. There is little documentation of the

cost of the coal provided by the NACC in the second lease period. It is

known that the average wholesale price of eastern United States coal in

the second lease period was only marginally higher than the price in the

 

_§§/ A 1910 report indicates that the NACC had on its payroll 4 Aleut
Janitors at a total annual salary of $840 (Def. Ex. E-70, at 9). There

is no record that these salaries were actually expended in the second
lease period. In the first lease period the Aleuts received miscellaneous

labor payments for some seal bundling and salting work. There are indications
that when the price per sealskin was increased (§gg_fn. 27, supra) the NACC
considered this heretofore separately compensated labor to be included in

the higher wage.

_Z2/ There are few entries in the record setting forth the amount of fish
provided. Indications are, however, that this donor good was provided
throughout the second lease period. Quantities of salmon supplied and

type of salmon supplied is speculative. If it is assumed, however, that

40 barrels of fish were provided each year —- half dried salmon, half

salt salmon -— and if it is assumed that the price per barrel ranged from

$5 for salt salmon to $7.65 for dried salmon (Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. II, at 102),
then the total expenditure by the NACC is $5,079. Defendant's expert
estimates the value of the salmon at $5,000 (Def. Ex. R, at 87); plaintiffs‘
expert estimates $319 (Pl. 3x. 701, Vol. I, at 3-26).

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 1 32

first lease period. It is also known that at the end of the second lease
period, when coal prices were relatively high, the Government paid the‘
NACC $17 for each ton of coal remaining on the islands. Assuming a small
increase of $1 per ton over the first lease period average of $13 and a
supply of 80 tons per year (see finding of fact No. 83) gives a total‘
cost to the NACC of $22,400.22!

96. Value of Salt and Barrels Provided. The value of salt and
barrels provided to the Aleuts was minimal and is not estimated.

97. Value of Health Services Provided. The NACC is reported to»
have spent $2,400 on doctors‘ salaries in 1904 (there were two doctors -one on each island -- and each received.$1,200). In addition, the NACC
paid the room and board for these physicians, amounting to $1,040.
Expenses for medical supplies and coal for the dispensary in 1904 totalled

$701.44. Assuming these amounts were expended yearly over the entire

second lease period, the value of doctors’ services and medicine over the
second lease period was $82,829. The record also indicates that $1,206
was spent on medical buildings in the lease period. Total expenditures
for health services are $84,035.

98. Value of Housing Provided. The second lease obliged the NACC

to furnish the Pribilof Aleuts with "a sufficient number of comfortable

 

_3Q/ Plaintiffs‘ expert estimates slightly over $20 a ton for coal for a

total cost of $33,137 (Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at 3-16). Defendant's expert
estimates cost per ton to the NACC of $10 (Def. Ex. R, at 87).

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 83

dwellings . . . [kept] in proper repair." The amount paid in 1890 by the

NACC to the ACC for the native dwellings is not known. The inventory value
of the native dwellings in 1910 was listed as $23,916 ($17,269 for St. Paul
dwellings, $6,647 for St. George dwellings), but in buying the NACC

property the Government in 1910 paid only $11,958 for native dwellings.

We consider it probable that the value of the dwellings for
inventory purposes was higher than fair market value, while value for
what was, in effect, forced sale to the Government was less than fair
market value. Considering these factors we believe that a reasonable
fair market value for the dwellings lies between these two extremes.

We believe that the midpoint figure -- $17,937 -— represents fair market
value.

There is no record of any housing constructed by the NACC for the
Aleuts. Repairs to the native dwellings by the NACC were minimal (several
houses may have been abandoned in this period). The only available records
show that repairs cost the NACC $54.42 on the Pribilofs in 1904 and cost
$36.36 on St. George in 1905. If it is assumed that housing repairs cost,
on the average, $75 per year, the total expenditure by the NACC for housing
was $19,437. I

99. Value of Providing and Maintaining a House of Worship. Although
the second lease obligated the NACC to provide and maintain a church for
the Aleuts, the NACC expended no monies for this purpose. The Aleuts had
previously built churches on St. Paul and on St. George which were maintained by the Aleut population without any contribution from the NACC.

42 Ind. c1. Comm. 1 34

100. Value of Providing for Widows, Orphans, Aged and Infirm. There

is little information concerning NACC expenditures to those Aleuts the
second lease obligated it to support. There i§_a record of controversy
between the Government and the NACC as to which Aleuts were entitled to
NACC support. All that has been shown in the record is that the NACC
maintained it spent $1,943 for widows and orphans on St. Paul in 1904;
$947 on St. George in 1904; and $1,709 on St. George in 1905. Contributions
to Aleuts must have varied greatly as the composition of the population
changed and as the NACC altered its policies as to whom to support, when
to support these people, and in what manner to support them. It is clear
that the level of support provided by the NACC to widows and orphans did
not equal the income of other Pribilof Aleuts. Defendant's expert states
that the widows and orphans must have experienced severe economic
deprivation. A contribution of $2,000 per year would have provided a

per capita income of $50 to 40 widows and orphans. This figure is a
reasonable estimate of support given Aleut per capita income.

Applying $2,000 per year over the lease period gives total expenditures of

$40,000 over the lease period.

101. Value of Educational Services. The best estimate of expenditures
31/
for education in the second lease period is $75,721. Over 90 percent of

this expense was for payment of teachers‘ salaries.

glj This is the estimate of plaintiffs‘ expert (Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at 3-46).

The estimate includes the cost of teachers‘ salaries, school supplies and school
buildings. Defendant's expert did not estimate expenditures for education.

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 1 85

102. Salaries, Transportation, Offices. The NACC had other costs
which for the year 1902 Henry Elliott listed as follows: 2

Salaries and subsistence of foreman and white

assistants on islands $ 12,000
Charter of small tramp steamer, three months 15,000
Insurance from islands to London 7,000
Salt & bundling on islands 250
Salaries of secretary and clerk, office rent,

etc., San Francisco 6,000
Wharfage, packing, casks, etc., San Francisco 2,000
Railroad freight, San Francisco to New York 1,000
Steamer freight, New York to London 500
Brokerage, dock charges, and agents‘ London sales 15,000

Total $ 68,000

These figures, although unverified,provide the best available
approximation of NACC costs. Applying these costs over the 20-year

lease period results in an expenditure of $1,360,000.

103. Egpenditures by the NACC for Miscellaneous Buildings. The NACC

inventory in 1910 included a number of watchhouses, warehouses, salthouses,
a library, and other miscellaneous structures. There is no basis to
determine those structures for which the NACC made expenditures. The
inventory value of "Company buldings" was $37,287 in 1910 for which the
Government paid $18,674. In 1890 the NACC paid the ACC $55,000 for

"buildings, improvements, and telephone" on the Pribilofs. Given these

circumstances it would be speculative to estimate expenditures by the

NACC for miscellaneous structures on the Pribilofs.

42 Ind. c1. Comm. 1 86

104. Pa nt to the U. 3. Government. The NACC paid the Government
327

$3,460,675—" during the second lease period.

105. Total Expenditures and Revenues to the NACC. NACC revenues

during the second lease period are as follows:

(1) Sale of Sealskins $ 9,489,728
(2) Sale of Foxskins 230,400
Total Revenue $ 9,720,128

NACC expenditures during the second lease period are as follows:

(1) Pribilof Aleuts for sealing $ 184,275
(2) Pribilof Aleuts for foxes taken 43,730
(3) Pribilof Aleuts for miscellaneous
labor 2,000
(4) Cost of salmon provided 5,079
(5) Cost of coal provided 22,400
(6) Cost of health care provided 84,035
(7) Cost of housing provided 19,437
'(8) Cost of support for widows, etc. 40,000
(9) Cost of education provided 75,721
(10) Cost of salaries, transportation,
offices 1,360,000
(11) Payment to U. 8. Government 3,460,675
Total $5,297,352

.32] Def. Ex. G—l includes in the Government's lease income certain income

from "rent of islands of Alaska for propagating foxes" (Def. Ex. G—8). There
is no evidence that this income was derived from the Pribilof Islands and on
the contrary could, in all probability, be traced to fox raising ventures on

other islands.

Def. Ex. R fails to arrive at this figure. In P1. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at
6-11, plaintiff's expert makes an unsupported assertion that revenues from

the second lease were $3,752,415.

In 1898 the Supreme Court ruled that the NACC was entitled to a reduction in the $60,000 annual rental price due to restrictions the Government
placed on the number of seals allowed to be killed (North American Commercial
Co. v. United States, 171 U. S. 110 (1897)). Consequently, yearly rental
payments to the Government were only a fraction of $60,000.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 87

106. Net Profit to the NACC From Commercial Qperations Under the

Second Lease. Total revenues minus total expenditures leave net profit

23/
to the NACC of $4,422,776.

107. Revenue to the U. 8. Government. The Government was paid
$3,460,675 by the NACC from.l890 to 1909. As in the first lease, the only
sources of revenue to the Government were the annual rental payment and

the tax per sealskin. No revenue was realized as a result of the fox

33/
killing operation.

108. Government Expenditures in the Second Lease Period. The

Government stationed agents on the Pribilofs, appropriated monies for

Pribilof Aleut welfare, and constructed and maintained structures on the

islands. Other governmental actions involving the Pribilof Islands area

included the naval patrol of the Bering Sea and the arrangement of a modus

vivendi with Great Britain concerning pelagic sealing.

109. Government Compensation to Aleuts for Labor. Although government

agents in the 1889-1909 period required the Pribilof Aleuts to work for the

§§] Defendant's expert has estimated net profits of the NACC as $4,390,917
(Def. Ex. R, at 77). Plaintiffs’ expert estimates profits as $4,707,400 -the midpoint of a possible profit range of $4,315,100 to $5,099,700 (Pl.
Ex. 701, Vol. I, at 6-18). Henry Elliott estimates that profits to the

NACC were $4,976,574 (Def. Ex. E-49, at 964).

_§4/ In addition to the revenue collected from the NACC, plaintiff's expert
contends that an estimated additional $926,884 collected as duties on
sealskins should be counted as profit to the Government (P1. Ex. 701, Vol. I,
at 6-13). Plaintiffs also estimate as government expenses 5 percent of the
amount collected, or $46,344, to give a net return from duties of $880,540.

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 1 88

Government in various projects and at various chores, the Government did
not compensate the Aleuts for this work.

110. Government Agents‘ Salaries. The salaries and expenses of
35/
government agents in the 1890-1909 period totaled $235,085. The

salaries and expenses of the four agents on the islands averaged $11,754.
111. Supplies for Pribilof Aleut Welfare. The Government appropriated
and spent $335,302 for Pribilof Aleut welfare during the second lease

period (P1. Ex. G-1, Sch. 3-2).

112. Ex enditures for Buildin Construction and Re air. The Government
367

spent $3,790 for buildings in the second lease period.-_113. Miscellaneous Government Expenses. Defendant's exhibit G—27

lists several other government expenses in the second lease period (these
37/
are totaled in Def. Ex. G-1, at 15). These are:

(1) Proposals for lease of fur seal islands in

Alaska $ 641.04
(2) Statistics relating to fur industries and

natives of Alaska _3§/ 15,164.34
(3) Protecting seal and salmon fisheries of Alaska 31,510.97
(4) Reimbursement to NACC for supplies 22] 7,465.33

'36] Def. Ex. G-1 omits a $3,000 expense for repairs to public buildings
included in Def. Ex. G-27 for the fiscal year 1910.

‘Q1! See also Def. Ex. E-42, at 42. The GSA report uses three colums to
report these expenses: "Ordinary expenses,” "Miscellaneous expenses," and
"Reimbursement to NACC." The GSA report does not explain how an ordinary
expense differs from a miscellaneous expense -- and in fact is inconsistent
in differentiating between the two.

§§/ The GSA report does not indicate why this expense should be included
here rather than in its category titled "Bering Sea Patrol."

(8) Commission on damages for seizure of vessels in

Bering Sea 75,000.00
(9) Payment of Bering Sea awards $73,151.26

114. Pelagic Sealing in the Bering Sea. Pelagic sealing grew

dramatically in the latter portion of the first lease period and increased
41/
still further in the second lease period. The United States viewed pelagic

sealing as a threat to the continued existence of the fur seal herd and
attempted to restrict pelagic sealing. The Government chose to view the
Bering Sea as United States territorial water and seized a number of
British flag vessels engaged in sealing in violation of United States law.
Following a protest by Great Britain, the International Tribunal of
Arbitration met and found the Bering Sea to be an international waterway.
The United States eventually paid Great Britain $473,151.26 for the vessel
seizures.

115. International ggreements Prove Ineffective to Halt Pelagic
Sealing. In the early 1890's the United States and Great Britain agreed

upon a modus vivendi to limit seal killing. Later the International

 

Tribunal of Arbitration placed some restrictions on pelagic sealing.

QQI See footnote 38, supra.

_££/ A Congressional committee found that a major figure in the NACC had
himself engaged in illegal pelagic sealing.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 90

None of the restrictions proved effective and pelagic sealing continued

to flourish throughout the second lease period.

116. Protection of Seal Herd. With the increase in pelagic sealing,

 

the United States increased its naval presence in the Bering Sea. From
1891 through 1894 U. S. Navy ships patrolled the Bering Sea. The

Bering Sea Patrol of the Revenue Cutter Service also patrolled the

Bering Sea during the second lease period.

117. Amount Spent by Revenue Cutter Service on Fur Seal Patrol. The

Acting Secretary of the Treasury in a report concerning the duties of the
Revenue Cutter Service from 1890 to 1909, stated that it was "hardly practicable" to separate the work these cutters performed on fur seal patrol

from their other duties in Alaskan waters. The Acting Commissioner of

the Bureau of Fisheries of the Department of Labor and Commerce stated
in 1910 that if the cutters assigned to the Bering Sea Patrol were not so

engaged, they would be employed elsewhere, and therefore "no additional

cost of maintenance 13 involved."

118. Defendant's Experts Estimate Approximately $5,000,000 Spent on

Fur Seal Protection. Defendant's experts have estimated that the actual

expense of the Government's fur seal protection during the second lease
period was $5,000,000. The Acting Secretary of the Treasury stated that
on the average 2.75 vessels were on patrol in Alaskan waters during the
1890-1909 period and the annual cost of maintaining a cutter was $42,000

per year. The fur seal patrol season lasted only 5 months, however,

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 1 91

so that the cost of maintaining each vessel during the patrol season was

less than $20.000- Assuming. arguendo, that all the expenses of the

patrol were for fur seal protection, the Revenue Cutter Service expended

approximately $50,000 per year (see also P1. proposed finding of fact
42/
No. 449), and $1 million over the lease period, for fur seal protection.

119. Government Profit, Second Lease Period (Excluding Patrol

Costs). In the 1890-1909 period payments by the NACC to the Government

43/
totalled $3,460,675,and expenditures were $594,169. Profit was

$2,866,506.

TERMINATION OF THE LEASING SYSTEM:
THE UNITED STATES AS SOLE ADMINISTRATOR

120. The Act of gpril 21, 1910 $36 Stat. 3262. On April 21, 1910,
Congress ended the system of leasing the Pribilof Islands to private parties
and granted to the Department of Commerce and Labor full authority not only

to regulate the seal harvest and protect the herd, but also to harvest the

seals and market the furs, as well as to provide for the employment,

32] Def. Ex. R includes in its $5,000,000 estimate $703,048 for expenses
of the U. 8. Navy in patrolling the North Pacific and Bering Sea from
1892 to 1894.

33/ See findings of fact Nos. 107 through 113. In finding No. 113,
items 6 and 7 were included as expenses. Other items in No. 113 were
either included in other figures or are deemed to have too tenuous a

connection with the sealskin monopoly.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 92

education, protection, and comfort of Pribilof Aleuts. The primary
motivation for the Government's termination of the system of private

lessees was the dwindling population of the Pribilof seal herds.

121. Provisions of the Act Providing for Compensation, Comfort,

ygintenance, Education and Protection. The Act of April 21, 1910,

Section 3, provided that:

whenever seals are killed and sealskins taken on any

of the Pribilof Islands the native inhabitants of said
islands shall be employed in such killing and in curing
the skins taken, and shall receive for their labor fair
compensation, to be fixed from time to time by the
Secretary of Commerce and Labor, who shall have the
authority to prescribe by regulation the manner in which
such compensation shall be paid to the said natives or
expended or otherwise used in their behalf and for their
benefit.

Section 9 of the act provided, in part, that the Secretary of Labor

and Commerce "shall likewise have authority to furnish food, shelter,

fuel, clothing, and other necessaries of life to the native inhabitants
of the Pribilof Islands and to provide for their comfort, maintenance,

education, and protection."

122. Government Administrative Organization. The Bureau of Fisheries

of the Department of Comerce and Labor administered the Pribilofs until
1939. After that date the Fish and wildlife Service of the Department

of the Interior was responsible for the islands‘ administration.

123. Proceeds of Pribilof Island Revenues Went Both for Egpenses
and Into the Treasury. Unlike the earlier periods when government revenues

42 Ind. Cl. Com. 1 93

from Pribilof Islands operations went solely into the Treasury, part of
the revenues in the government period were used to defray operational

expenses. The Government appropriated additional funds for certain other

expenses.

124. Number of Seals Killed on Pribilof Islands, 1910-1946.

Approximately 1,367,939 seals were killed on the Pribilofs in the

44/
government operations period.

125. Gross Revenue to Government from Sale of Sealskins. The

Government realized $42,745,710 from the sale of Pribilof Islands sealskins
45/

harvested in the years 1910-1946, inclusive.

44/ This is the figure used in Def. Ex. R, at 117. Plaintiffs expert's
figure is nearly identical (see Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at A-4).

45/ Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. I, and Def. Ex. R calculate identical sales revenues
for 21 of the 37 years in question. For many other years in question the
amounts arrived at by the two experts are nearly identical. When Def. Ex.
R, at 123, 126-129, and P1. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at A-12, were in agreement

concerning a yearly revenue figure, that figure was used. Where there was
disagreement, Def. Ex. G—l5 and B-54 were used to determine the sales figure.

Def. Ex. E-54 was considered the most complete source. Def. Ex. G-1
calculates fur seal revenues on a fiscal year basis and arrives at a figure

substantially different from the other experts‘ figures. $46,147 was
deducted from the total figure to take into account the sale of Japanese

sealskins (Def. Ex. G-1, at 21).

Def. Ex. R includes in gross revenues sales of fur seals harvested

through 1946, but sold in 1947 through 1950. Revenues collected from
these sealskins sold after the end of the 1910-1946 period were $7,525,156
(defendant's expert report does not describe how this figure was reached,
but a review of the annual reports of seals killed and sold indicated that

this figure is correct (see Pl. Ex. 91 (1947, 1948, 1949, 1950)). These

revenues are included in the $42,745,710 figure. No other expert has
considered post-1946 sales of pre-1947 sealskins (see Pl. proposed finding

of fact 362). Defendant's expert's figure for gross revenues and the
figure arrived at above would be more nearly the same but for an error

of $100,000 in defendant's estimate of 1933 sales.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 94

126. Location and Type of Sealskins Sold. From the beginning of the

government operations period through January 1913, sealskins were shipped

to London for sale. Beginning in December 1913 the seal harvest was
shipped to St. Louis, Missouri, where the firm of Funsten Bros. and Co.
(later the Fouke Fur Co.) auctioned the sealskins. Prior to 1916 the
sealskins were sold in an unprepared state, but after 1916 the sealskins
were generally dressed and dyed prior to auction (Def. Ex. 54 (1916, at
6)). The Government was the beneficiary of all sums realized from the

sale of sealskins. The Government entered into various contracts with
Funsten or Fouke to compensate these companies for th ‘1 role in the prepa46/
ration and sale of the skins._—'

127. Number of Foxes Killed and Gross Revenues Realized. Approximately
47/

37,512 foxes were taken on the Pribilofs in the 1910-1946 period._—' Fox

pelts were sold at auction by Funsten Bros. and Co. (later Fouke Fur Co.),

usually twice yearly and usually in St. Louis. The best estimate of
48/

revenue derived from the sale of fox pelts is $l,240,538._—'

 

46/ There is insufficient evidence in the record to calculate profit to
Funsten Bros. or Fouke Fur Co. from the sealskin and foxskin trade.

_§Z/ Plaintiffs’ and defendant's experts agree on 28 of the 37 yearly fox
harvest totals. Only plaintiffs‘ expert listed fox harvests for the seasons
of 1910-11 and 1911-12. Only defendant's expert listed harvests for the
seasons of 1912-13 and 1913-14 (see Def. Ex. 54, at 11). Totals for the

remaining 5 years were estimated as the average of plaintiffs’ and
defendant's figures.P1aintiffs' list 1,426 foxes killed during 1931-32;

the correct number is 11,426.

.§§/ This is the average of plaintiffs‘ and defendant's experts’ estimates.
Def. Ex. G-1, at 21,estimates $1,243,709 for gross sales; Pl. Ex. 701 at
A-22,estimates $1,237,366. There were probably revenues from fox pelts
harvested during or prior to 1946 and sold after 1946 but no expert attempts

to calculate that figure.

128. Revenue from Pribilof Islands Seal B roducts Plant. Revenue

from the production of seal meal at the Pribilof Islands byproducts plant

value of seal oil sold was $197,103. The value of seal blubber sold was
$8,816.22/

129. Miscellaneous Revenue to the United States. Def. Ex. G-1, at

21, lists revenues for a series of minor items. These are:

(1) Sale of Foxes (live) $ 11,305
(2) Sale of Sea Otter Skins 7,317
(3) Sales of Barrels, Drums, etc. 4,933

plaintiffs‘ expert's figure (Def. Ex. G-17 (1946)).

131. The Fur Seal Convention of 1911. In 1911 the United States,
Great Britain (representing the interests of the Dominion of Canada),

Japan, and Russia entered into an agreement to preserve and protect fur
seals (37 Stat. 1542). Each signatory country agreed to prohibit its
subjects and vessels from engaging in pelagic sealing in the North

Pacific Ocean. The United States agreed, inter alia, to pay to both

Great Britain and Japan $200,000 upon ratification of the treaty,

$10,000 for each year seal killing was prohibited on the Pribilofs, and

to deliver to each 15 percent of the yearly harvest of sealskins from
the islands. (The United States was allowed to reimburse itself for the
initial payments by retaining sealskins from the shares of Canada and
JSPEU in later YEBFB (37 Stat. 1542, at Art. XI).) The Commission
also gave the United States the right to take 10 percent of the Japanese
fur seal catch on Robben Island (37 Stat. 1542, at Art. XIII).

132. Allocation of Furs and Monies Under the Fur Seal Convention.
Japan and Great Britain (later ahe Dominion of Canada) initially chose
to take their 15 percent share of the Pribilof seal catch in money rather

than skins. In 1933 the Dominion of Canada altered its policy and began

taking its percentage in skins. In 1941 Canada took part skins, part cash.

By 1942 Japan had withdrawn from the treaty and the United States and

Canada provisionally agreed upon a 80 percent-20 percent division of
Pribilof Island sealskins. In 1943 Canada took its share partially in

skins and partially in cash. In 1944 the Fur Seal Act was enacted giving

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 97

Canada a 20 percent share in the Pribilof sealskins. In 1944 and there51/

after it appears that Canada took skins exclusively.

133. Paygents by and to the United States Under Fur Seal Agreements,

1910-1946. The best estimate of amounts paid by the United States as

 

obligations under the Fur Seal Convention of 1911, and the later agreew
52/
ment with Canada, is $3,471,527.

Under Art. XIII of the Convention the United States was to
receive 10 percent of those Japanese sealskins taken on Robben Island.

Gross revenue from the sale of these sealskins was $46,147. The expenses

in regard to the Japanese sealskins were as follows:

(l),Dressing, Dyeing and Machining 5 22.500
(2) Transportation Costs 1.927
(3) Cash Discounts 443
(4) Sales Commission 1,483

Total 3 26,353

134. Decline of Pela ic Sealin Under the Fur Seal Convention. After
537
1911 illegal pelagic sealing declined drastically. Officials reported

 

§l/ The value of the sealskins given to Canada has not been estimated.

ggf Payments for fiscal 1912 through fiscal 1921 are taken from Def. Ex.
E-75, at 22. Payments from fiscal 1922 through fiscal 1944 are taken

from Def. Ex. C-17 (Def. Ex. G-1, at 31-36) from the line entitled

"Treaty Obligations." There is considerable doubt, however, whether Def.
Ex. G-17 is an accurate account of payments to Canada and Japan, especially

after 1932.

_§§/ The only sanctioned pelagic sealing that continued was that conducted
by Indians, primarily in southeastern Alaska.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 93

in 1912 that there was no indication that pelagic sealing was attempted.
Later reports substantiate the almost complete elimination of pelagic

sealing.

135. Egpenses Paid From Proceeds of Sale, Fiscal Years 1911-1946.

Expenses paid from the proceeds of sealskin and foxskin sales in fiscal

years19l1-1946 totaled $17,494,045. The components of this total are as

follows:

136. Expenses Paid From Proceeds of Sales After Fiscal 1946 For

1943-1946 Harvest. Expenses paid from proceeds of sales after fiscal

1946 for fur seals harvested during fiscal 1943-1946 can be estimated
' 54/
at $2,189,752.

géj Def. Ex. R lists payments of $503,065 for fiscal year 1947 (seals

sold from the harvests of 1944, 1945, and 1946) and payments of
$1,686,687 for fiscal years 1948, 1949, and 1950 (a portion of the
seals sold in these years were taken in 1945 and 1946). P1. proposed
finding of fact No. 363 omits expenses for fiscal 1947.

government period, 1910-1946, the United States began dispensing to the

 

§§/ In 1910 $498 of the St. Paul Aleuts' sealing income was paid by the
NACC. No record of sealing payments can be found for the calendar years
1912-1917 (Def. Ex. G-1, at 37). Payments for 1925-1927 have been computed
as stated in the annual reports (Def. Ex. E-101 to E-103). Payments for
1944-1946 have been computed with the amounts actually paid to civilian
Aleuts for sealing. (Several Aleuts were members of the United States

Army and were detailed to work in the sealing operation. These mn

received compensation from the Army.)

,§§/ Information on fox harvest income on St. Paul from 1910 to 1917 is not
complete (§§e_Def. Ex. G-21) but can be estimated from annual harvests.
The 1910 payment may have been made by the NACC. Fox harvest income on
St. George is not complete from 1914 to 1917. Estimates from Def. Ex. G-1,
at 38 have been used. Earnings for 19llare figured at $1,196 (Def. Ex.

the NACC.

Aleuts food, c1othing,and fuel purchased with appropriated monies. The
food and clothing, called "Store Issue" was limited to articles of

necessity. The fuel issue was always coal.

141. Expenses of Store Issue Supplied to St. Paul and St. George

Aleuts, Fiscal Years 1911-1923. There is little data in the record
indicating the amounts of store issue and fuel issued to the St. Paul

Aleuts from fiscal 1911 to 1923. A reasonable estimate of store issue
57/
and fuel is $385,645. Subtracting 8.5 percent from this expenditure
58/
as coal issue results in net expenditure on store issue of $352,865.

There is almost no data in the record indicating the amount of

food, supplies and fuel issued to the St. George Aleuts from fiscal 1911
59/
to 1923. A reasonable estimate of store issue is $216,925. Subtracting
60/
8.5 percent from this expenditure as coal issue leaves expenditures on

food and clothing of $198,486.

.51] The value of store issue and fuel are known for 5 years of the
period -- fiscal 1913, 1914, 1920, 1921, 1923 (Def. Ex. B-54 (1913);

Def. Ex. G-68). (For two of these years,l9l3 and 1914, the amount
expended on St. Paul has to be calculated from the amount expended on

the islands as a whole. This is calculated by taking the figure for

both islands and multiplying by 64 percent —— the approximate percentage

of the islands‘ population residing on St. Paul (Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at
3-3:14).) Assuming 1913 and 1914 are representative of the expenditures in
the first portion of the period and 1920, 1921, and 1923 are representative
of the second portion, an average expenditure of $29,665 was computed for

fiscal years 1911 to 1923.

on coal. See also fiscal 1924 and 1925 (Def. Ex. G-29, at 1-2).

supplied to the Aleuts for fiscal 1911 to 1923 was $551,351. The expense

of fuel supplied to the Aleuts from fiscal 1911 to 1923 was $51,219.

143. Expenses of Fuel Supplied_to Aleuts, Fiscal Years 1924-1946.

The value of coal supplied to the Pribilof Aleuts, 1924-1946 (excluding

fiscal 1943 and 1944) is estimated at $122,226 -- $73,770 on St. Paul

Years 1924-1946. Expenses for store issue on St. Paul and St. George

62/
from fiscal 1923 through 1946 (excluding 1943 and 1944) are adequately

documented. Total expenditures to St. Paul Aleuts were approximately

63/ 93/
$425,442, and to St. George Aleuts approximately $287,208, for a total

of $712,650.

61] Data for coal issue to the Aleuts after fiscal 1923 is generally available
in the record (Def. Ex. C-29, 30). However, data for fiscal 1926, 1927, 1943,
1944, 1945, and 1946 is missing (Def. Ex. G-1, at 37, 38). The total value of
coal was arrived at by averaging coal costs for years in which costs were known

and applying those averages to fiscal years in which cost data was missing.
estimate or average cost was computed for fiscal years 1943 and 1944 since during

those years the islands were in part or in whole evacuated.

146. Government Expenditures on Aleut Housing. The record is

incomplete as to the amount expended by the Government for Aleut housing
in the 1910-1946 period. A reasonable estimate of government expenditure

is $79,655 -- $51,827 on St. Paul and $27,828 on St. George. The parties

 

‘§§/ Def. Ex. G-1, at 37-38,estimates a greater expenditure. Included in
this estimate, however, are figures for fiscal years 1911-1920 that are
taken from Def. Ex. G-16. It is almost certain that the figures quoted
from this exhibit include more than expenditures for native stores and
fuel. Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at 3-25,estimates total value for the
government period as $833,013. It appears that plaintiffs‘ estimate is
based on far less evidence than that employed in reaching the instant

estimate (See P1- Ex. 701. V01- II. at 104-130). Def. Ex. R combines store
issue and coal issue for the 1919-1945 period and apparently estimates
many of the years‘ expenditures in arriving at a higher expenditure figure.

66] Plaintiff would add a $8 per ton transportation cost for coal
supplied (P1. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at 3-15). Cost of coal in this calculation

includes no sum for transportation other than that already possibly
included in the Government's records.

are in apparent agreement over the improvement value of the native
structures build on St. Paul and St. George.§l/ In dispute is whether the
Pribilof Aleuts were actually paid for their labor on the structures or
whether the Government considered their remuneration to be the Store and
Fuel Issue previously taken into consideration (finding of fact No.

145). The record indicates that Pribilof Aleuts were not paid for

labor in building their houses.

Although the amount of investment value traceable to unpaid Pribilof

Aleut labor is unknown, 40 percent of total investment value is a reason68/
able estimate.

l47. Amounts Expended for Fur Seal Service From Appropriations.

$6,636,689 was expended by the Fur Seal Service from 1910 through 1946.
This cost includes the value of goods and services previously considered

cost of items not heretofore valued (e.g., buildings, salaries of white
government employees, "travel and subsistence,” "freight and express,"

"purchase of Steamer Roosevelt," "salaries on Steamer Roosevelt."

148. Value of Coast Guard Seal Patrol Not Subject to Qpantification.

The value of naval patrol relating to seal protection by the Coast Guard

quantifiedrégl Government vessels did continue to patrol the Bering Sea
even after illegal pelagic sealing had come to a virtual halt (P1. proposed
findings of fact Nos. 437-446). But these vessels had many duties and
objectives unconnected with sealing -— including the servicing of an

expanding population ~- and it would be wholly speculative to attempt to

estimate the costs attributable to seal patrol.

of food and clothing the Government contributed was $267,542 (finding
of fact Nos. 111,155); and the NACC contributed $45,079 (finding of
fact Nos. 94, 100). In the government period food and clothing valued

at $1,264,001 was provided (finding of fact Nos. 140-14;).

19/ This is an estimation. Information on miscellaneous income is fragmentary
for the 1910-1946 period. The Government's reports mention the payment of
extra income to the Pribilof Aleuts for several years in the years 19101921. In the years that specific payments are listed, the sums involved
ranged from $1,120 in 1918, to $364 in 1921. After 1921 no reports were
located that listed payment of extra income. It is probable that the
Government terminated its policy of paying Aleuts for "extra‘ work at
approximately this time (353 Def. Ex. R, at 142-43). Tnerefsre, payments

for the 1910-1946 period are estimated at $1,000 each year from 1910-1922,

and no payments thereafter.

155. Value of Fuel Provided, 1870-1946. The value of fuel provided
to the Aleuts during the 76-year period was $279,205. The value of fuel
provided in the first lease period was $15,600 (finding of fact No. 67).
In the second lease period the value of fuel the Government contributed
was $67,760 (gee finding of fact Ns. 111, 95; Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at
3-16); and the NACC contributed $22,400 (finding of fact No. 95). The
Government supplied $173,445 worth of fuel in the 1910-1946 period
(finding of fact No. 145).

156. Value of Medical Care Provided, 1870-1946. The value of
medical care provided to the Aleuts during the 76-year period was
$459,866. The value of medical care provided in the first lease period
was $60,000 (finding of fact No. 69). In the second lease period medical
care provided was valued at $84,035 (finding of fact No. 97). In the 191071/
1946 period the Government provided $315,831 worth of health services.

 

111/ This is the estimate of P1. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at 3-34. This estimate is
reasonable in view of the limited information available for health care costs
(egg Def. Ex. R, at 149). Def. Ex. R estimated the health care provided at
a figure approximately $1,000 a year higher than plaintiffs‘ estimate (see
Def. Ex. R, at 153). Defendant's estimate also excludes the cost of medical
building construction included in plaintiff's estimate. The parties are in
virtual agreement concerning doctors‘ salaries, the bulk of medical expenditures, but defendant estimates higher costs for dentist and nurse salaries
(indicating a higher estimate of time spent on the islands by dentists and
nurses). In view of the fragmentary information concerning salaries paid

to dentists and nurses while employed on the Pribilofs, plaintiffs‘ estimate
is more reasonable. Another factor to be considered is the amount of health
care rendered to white employees and temporary non-Pribilof Aleut workmen.
Although neither party allocates a portion of medical care provided to these
groups, it is likely that health care was provided, and therefore the value
of the health care provided to the Pribilof Aleuts is less than estimated.

In plaintiffs‘ calculation 30 percent of the cost of medical buildings is
deducted as the portion of the inventory value attributable to uncompensated

native labor. This is a reasonable assumPt1°n42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 108

157. Value of Educational Services Provided, 1870-1946. The amount
72/

expended on educational services during the 76-year period was $323,543.

The value of educational services provided in the first lease period was

minimal and is not estimated (see finding of fact No. 70). In the second

lease period the value of educational services provided was $75,721

(finding of fact No. 101), The Government expended $247,822 for educational
73/
services in the 1910-1946 period. Of the monies expended, an estimated

$19,523 was spent on school building construction ($2,750 in the lease
74/
periods and $16,773 in the government period.)

12/ This figure is the sum of the expenditures listed in P1. Ex. 701,
Vol. I, at 3-46. Plaintiffs‘ expert has erroneously totaled the sum of
these expenditures as $256,958.

12/ This is plaintiff's expert's estimate which appears reasonable given
the fragmentary information available for educational services. Defendant

makes no estimate of the value of educational services provided. Several
Pribilof Aleut children were sent to the Chemawa Indian School in Salem,
Oregon (Def. Ex. J, at 148) in the first portion of the Government period.
No estimate has been made of the value of this educational service. Over~
all, the quality of education provided the Pribilof Aleuts was extremely
low. Government agents were dubious about the value of providing education
to the Aleuts (Pl. Ex. 288) and the goal of the educational system was to

produce "good sealers" (Pl. Ex. 661, 1/12/44). Until after World War 11
St. Paul only offered six grades and St. George five. The practice of
sending Aleuts to the Chemawa School was discontinued in 1921, in part
because the Aleuts sent there saw the ample means and environment of the
American mainland and were dissatisfied upon returning totju2Pribilofs

(Def. Ex. J, at 148-151).

Zjj Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at 3-42, 3-43,has estimated approximately 40
percent of the cost of educational buildings as the portion of inventory
value attributable to uncompensated native labor. Permanent improvement

records from the islands indicated this is a reasonable approximation
(see Pl. Ex. 516, 515).

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 109

158. Value of the Water System Provided, l870—1946. A reasonable

estimate of the value of the water system provided for the Aleuts during
75/ '

the government period is $l2,450.__. Expenditure from 1870 to 1909 is

minimal and is not estimated.

159. Value of Sanitation Facilities Provided, 1870-1946. The value

of sanitation facilities provided during the lease periods was minimal
76/

and is not estimated. The value of sanitation facilities provided

during the government period was also small: a reasonable estimate of
77/
this cost is $3,011.

160. Cost of Electric Power Facilities Provided, 1870-1946. Small

electric power plants existed on both St. Paul and St. George by the 1920's.

Little of the electricity produced was made available to the Aleuts. Due

_Z§/ This is the estimate of P1. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at 3-52, 3-54. This
figure was arrived at by finding inventory value of the St. Paul and
St. George water systems, deducting a percentage for inventory value

attributable to unpaid Aleut labor, and halving the resultant figure to
account for non-Aleut use. This figure should be considered as only an
approximation based on reasonable assumptions.

lg] Neither plaintiffs nor defendant estimate sanitation costs in the lease
periods.

_ZZ/ This is the total of the cost of sanitation facilities provided on

St. Paul ($1,986) and the inventory value of sanitation facilities on

St. George ($1,025), as given by plaintiff's expert (Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. I,
at 3-55, 3-60). Included in the figure for St. George is $375 for a sewer
system for the island school, presumably for native use. Plaintiffs’
experts total sanitation facilities provided at $2,790. It is not clear

how this figure was reached. Plaintiffs’ expert makes no deduction for
Aleut labor<n1 sanitation facilities not paid in cash.

42 Ind. Cl. Com. 1 110

to insufficient information to allocate costs, no estimate of the cost
78/
of providing electricity to the Aleuts will be made.

STANDARDS OF FAIR COMPENSATION, ADEQUATE GOODS AND SERVICES

161. Aleuts‘ Work Characterized. Members of the work forces in the
two Aleut comunities performed tasks in the seal and fox harvesting
operations which varied in complexity and amount of expertise required
depending upon the specific task in the overall process assigned to a
particular member of the work force. In the aggregate and for purposes
of establishing a standard of fair compensation, it is reasonable to posit
a work force of Aleut males, one-half of whom were skilled laborers and
one-half of whom were unskilledfzgl This work force operated in a climate
which imposed extreme physical hardship and in a geographical area of

remoteness from the amenities of civilization. This characterization of

the Aleut work force is valid throughout the entire period, 1870 to 1946.

 

_Z§/ Plaintiffs do not claim damages for insufficient electric power
provided (Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at 8-3).

_Z2/ Equation of the sealing trade to other types of employment is difficult.

Reports indicate that the Aleuts were extraordinarily proficient in the
skills involved in sealing (gee finding of fact No. 51). It should be
noted, however, that the Aleuts were not engaged in harvesting seals (or
fox) 12 months a year. Information is incomplete as to the average weekly
hours spent in company or government employ. There are indications that
the Government expected the Pribilof Aleuts to work full—time the entire
year for their compensation. The type of work performed, aside from
sealing, 13 not chronicled with any particularity. However, it is known
that some of this work, such as carpentry or boat building, was skilled
labor (§3_¢_»,_ P1, Ex. 38, at 26).

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 111

162. Reasonable Standard of Fair Compensation. In order to arrive

at a reasonable standard of fair compensation with which the actual
compensation paid to the Aleuts can be compared, it is necessary to
utilize available statistics which show average wages contemporaneously
paid to a work force performing tasks comparable in complexity to those
performed by the Aleuts,in conditions resembling as closely as possible
those conditions in which the Aleuts labored. The record in this case

does not include sufficient information to directly determine the wages

of a skilled, or unskilled worker in Alaska In order to determine the

wages ofan Alaskan worker, the wages of a hypothetical,partly skilled,

partly unskilled,eastern worker must first be found. (There is much more
information available for such an eastern worker than there is for an
Alaskan worker.) Then, by comparing eastern wage rates with the limited
information available for western United States and Alaskan wage rates,

fair wages for an Alaskan worker of appropriate skills can be estimated.

163. Eastern United States Wage Rates, 1870-1889. Wage rates for

eastern United States skilled workers varied during the period from 22.6

to 29.0 cents per hour. Wage rates for unskilled workers fluctuated from
80/
13.5 to 15.9 cents per hour. For each year 1870-1889, an average wage

(consisting of one-half the skilled wage plus one-half the unskilled wage)
81/
has been calculated.

164. .A1eut Work Force, 1870-1889. The Aleut work force between
1870 and 1889 fluctuated between 100 and 78 and has been calculated for
82/

each year in this period.

165. Aleut Work Force Earning Eastern United States Wage Rates,
1870-1889. Had the Pribilof Aleut work force worked in the eastern

United States at one-half skilled, one-half unskilled labor from 1870-1889,
83/
these Aleuts would have earned $1,194,869.16.

§3/_§gg finding of fact No. 175. The work force for each year in the 76year period was calculated by first surveying annual reports. All those
Aleuts engaged in sealing operations were deemed to be in the work force.
Complete work force figures are known for 44 of the years and partial
figures are known for several other years. The percentage of the population
engaged in sealing was calculated for the 44 years in which work force was
known and the average was applied to calculate work force in years figures
were not available. Total population figures were taken from Def. Ex. R,

at 34, 80, 136.

Two laundresses in 1918 and four to six "mess attendants" in the
years 1930-1943 were not included in the work force. Payment to "cooks"
is recorded in some years but these cooks were not Pribilof Aleuts. At
times shares in the sealing division went to those not engaged in sealing.
These people -— widows and priests, for example —- were eliminated from
work force statistics when possible.

P1. Ex. 726 estimates a vastly different figure for the Pribilof work

force. This figure is derived from general employment averages in the
United States. The Comission feels that such an estimation is an
inferior method of calculation when Pribilof work force figures are so

readily available for many years of the period.

172. Higher Wages Paid in Western United States as Compared With

Eastern United States Due to Frontier Factor. Due to labor shortages,
hardships, and remoteness, workers in the western United States were
paid more for comparable labor than their counterparts in the eastern

United States. This premium paid to western workers because of prevailing

conditons has been termed the "frontier factor."

173. Premium Paid to western United States Workers, 1870-1946.

Premiums paid to western United States workershave been calculated from
data available for the years 1869, 1890, 1919, 1929, and 1940. Wage

rates for the United States as a whole were compared with wage rates for

the states of Washington, Oregon and California (although wage rates for
the United States as a whole were used as a base, these rates are very
similar to wage rates prevailing in the eastern United States at the
time).2£/The premium ranges from 48 percent in 1869 to 9 percent in 1929.

174. The Pribilof Aleuts Should Receive a Premium Above Eastern

 

Wages Rates for Their Labor. The Pribilof Aleuts toiled in conditions
far more difficult and remote than workers in the western United States.
In 1869, a year in which the isolation and other conditions in the West
and in Alaska might have been roughly comparable, wages were 48 percent
higher in the western United States than in the eastern United States.

A comparison of the weekly earnings of production workers in Alaska with
those in the United States as a whole shows that for the years 1962-1976
(the only years for which figures are available) wages in Alaska averaged

95/
46.1 percent higher. The best estimate for the period 1870-1946 is that

 

_24/ Wages were 48 percent higher in 1869, 34 percent higher in 1890, 20
percent higher in 1919, 9 percent higher in 1929, and 18 percent higher in
1940. The declining wage differential reflects the industrial and social
development of the West. There was no comparable development in Alaska,
and the isolation and other conditions that typified the West in 1869

existed in Alaska throughout the period in question.

for comparable labor Alaskan workers received 45 percent more in wages
than their eastern United States counterparts. Therefore, a fair level

of compensation to the Aleuts is considered to be eastern wages plus 45

percent.

176. Total Standard of Com ensation to the Aleuts 1870-1946. The

total standard of fair compensation to the Pribilof Aleuts for the 76
years, 1870-1946, is $9,904,4l6EE¥b’ The value of fair compensation is
$1,732,560.28 in the first lease period, $1,185,148.44 in the second lease
period, and $6,986,706.83 in the government period.

177. Housing Insufficient. Aleuts were provided insufficient housing

during the entire 76-year period in question. The first housing construction

began in the 1870's when the ACC built frame cottages to replace the

barabaras in which the Aleuts traditionally lived. These frame dwellings
were not as well suited to the harsh climate of the Pribilofs as were the
barabaras (see finding of fact No. 10). For most of the years 1870-1946
there were not as many cottages as Aleut families. The cottages built

were very small; the most reliable estimates put the size of the structures
at approximately 20 feet by 10 feet.

Government employees often decried the number, size, and condition

of cottages provided. The cottages generally contained two rooms, one of
which served as a bedroom. As many as six people were forced to sleep on
the floor of a 10 foot by 12 foot bedroom. Few furnishings for the cottages

were provided. At one point a St. Paul population of 196 had only 40 beds.

Although the Government built approximately 70 houses in the 1920's

and 1930's, housing conditions remained inadequate. Government agents and

 

104/ See finding of fact No.lJ5,

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 123

other commentators continued to condemn the housing provided the Aleuts.

Native housing remained over-crowded and inadequate to the end of the

76-year period.

178. Standard for Aleut Housing, 1870-1909. The Commission finds
that the minimum adequate standard for an Aleut residence in the 1870-1909
period is a single family dwelling of wood construction containing four
rooms and 500 square feet. The standard dwelling has four small rooms
(approximately 10 feet by 10 feet) and a small storage area. This provides
a typical four-person Aleut family with one room for each person and two
sleeping areas for four people.

The size of the standard house has been selected for health and
privacy considerations. The wood construction has been selected for its

insulation value in a cold and wet climate.

179. Standard for Aleut Housing 1910-1946. The Comission finds

that the minimum adequate standard for an Aleut residence in the 1910-1946
period is a single family dwelling of wood construction containing five
rooms and 700 square feet. The standard dwelling has five small rooms, a
bathroom, and a small storage area. The increase in size over the four
room dwellings of the lease periods provides more space for the relatively
larger Aleut family. A bath is included as standard for this period. Wood
construction is considered standard. Health, privacy, and weather considerations suggested this model.

42 Ind. c1. Comm. 1 12”‘

180. Life and Maintenance of Standard Housin 1870-1946. A useful

life of 40 years is reasonable for dwellings erected on the Pribilof
Islands. Maintenance, however, would be higher than for the average
United States house because of the severe weather conditions existing

on the islands. Two percent of the cost of construction is a reasonable
annual maintenance cost.

131. Number of Aleut Families, 1870-1909. Information concerning
the number of families on the Pribilofs is not complete. A reasonable
estimate of the number of Aleut families on the Pribilofs in the first
few years of the first lease is 100. Later on in the 1870's the number
of families rose to 110 before entering a period of decline that was to

105/
last until the end of the lease periods.

132. Cost of Construction of Standard Housing, 1870-1909. The housing
standard assumes each family has a separate dwelling. One hundred houses
built in the first few years of the 1870's would have given each family a
house. A few years later, ten more houses would be needed to house the
increased population.

The coat of 100 standard houses in the 1870-1873 period would be
$1,250 each. In 1874-1878 the estimated cost of ten houses is $1,000 each.

Total cost of housing in this period is $135,000.

 

105/ Although the number of Aleut families probably exceeded 110 at times,
these were isolated population peaks that existed for only short periods.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 125

183. Cost of Construction of Standard Housing, 1910-1946. Assuming

Pribilof housing lasts 40 years, the Government should have replaced 71

of the original 110 dwellings by 1920 (there were only 71 families on
the islands at that time). As the number of families increased on the
Pribilofs, 32 more dwellings should have been built through 1946. The
value of the first 54 houses built would have been $2,442 each, the next

17 would have been worth $3,081 each, and the remaining 32 would have
106/
varied in value from $3,181 to $4,409. Total cost for housing in

this period is $310,223.

184. Maintenance Expenses in the Lease Periods. Annual maintenance

costs are 2 percent of the cost of each dwelling. One hundred ten dwellings
would have been necessary for adequate housing in the 1870's. As the
population and the number of families declined, however, not all of the

dwellings built need have been kept in repair. From 1870 through 1889 all
107/

of the houses built should have been kept in repair. From 1890 through
1899, 82 houses should have been kept in repair. In 1900-1909, 71 houses
should have been kept in repair. Of the first 100 houses built, all should

have been kept in repair for 20 years, 72 should have been kept in repair

 

;gg/ Seven houses in 1926-1930 would have cost $4,409 each; seven houses

in 1931-1935 would have cost $3,181 each; ten houses in 1936-1940 would

have cost $3,852 each; and eight houses in 1941-1946 would have each cost
$4,291. The Commission adopts plaintiffs‘ expert's estimates in calculating
housing costs. §3g_Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. II, at 336-7, 341-2; Pl. Ex. 701,

Vol. I, at 5-8 to 5-11.

107/ See Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at A-28. Number of houses to be kept in
'?Epair_is an estimate. The number of families fluctuated each year.
The number of houses to be maintained is assumed to equal the highest
number of families in any year of a 10-year period.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 126

for 30 years and 61 should have been kept in repair until replaced in

108/
1910-1913. The cost of maintaining these houses would have been

$83,250 at 2 percent of cost per year. Of the ten houses built in
1874~l879, all should have been kept in repair until replaced. The value

of this mintenance would have been $8,000. Total maintenance costs are

$91,250 for the lease periods.

185. Maintenance Expenses in the Governmnt Period. All the houses

built in the government period should have been maintained up to 1946.
Fifty-four houses should have been maintained an average of 35 years,

17 houses maintained 29 years, 7 houses maintained 18 years, 7 houses
maintained 13 years, 10 houses maintained 8 years, and 8 houses

maintained 3 years. Maintenance costs are 2 percent each year or $147,799.

186. Total Maintenance Egpenses. The total expense for maintenance

of standard housing would be $239,049 ($91,250 in the lease periods,
$147,799 in the government period).

187. Total Expenses for Housing Standard. The total expense for
housing construction and maintenance is $684,272 ($445,223 for construction

and $239,029 for maintenance). The following chart lists housing

construction and maintenance costs.

108/ The basic assumption made here is that older houses will all be
replaced before newer ones.

188. Value of Aleut Labor on Housing. Although the standard

developed mandates an expenditure of $684,272 on housing, a portion of
this expenditure would have been paid to Aleuts for working on housing
construction and maintenance. This sum has previously been credited to
the Aleuts and against the Government, so it must be deducted in order to

109/
avoid a double recovery to plaintiffs. It is reasonable to assume that

payments to the Aleuts would have constituted 25 percent of the standard
110/
housing expenditures. Therefore, 25 percent of $684,272 (total construction and maintenance expenses) will be deducted from the cost of
providing housing.

The cost of providing standard housing ($684,272) minus the value of
Aleut labor on housing (25 percent of $684,272) leaves $513,204 as the

standard for housing.

189. Fuel Provided to Pribilof Aleuts Insufficient. The amount of

 

fuel supplied to the Pribilof Aleuts during the 1870-1946 period was

vastly insufficient to provide an adequate degree of comfort.

109/ A similar procedure was employed in finding of fact No. 146 to guard
against a double counting of government expenditures. There 40 percent of
the inventory value of housing was deducted.

110/ This is an estimate. It is difficult to attempt to predict the value

of Aleut labor on the projected standard housing construction and maintenance.
In finding of fact No. 146 Aleut labor was deemed to represent 40 percent of

the value of the housing actually provided. In a much more aggressive
housing program, however, it is reasonable to assume that the value of
Pribilof Aleut labor to the whole would fall (in part because the Aleuts

were a small labor force and more outside workers would have to be employed)

and 25 percent appears a likely estimate.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 129

The climate of the Pribilofs makes it imperative that inhabitants
have a proper supply of fuel (see finding of fact No. 15). The average
daily year—around high temperature is 39°F. The average daily high

temperature during the summer is approximately &9°F. It is necessary to

have heat every day of the year.

190. Insufficiency of Fuel Provided in Lease Period. when the Aleuts

were moved from their barabaras to the ACC-built frame cottages, fuel needs
went up enormously. The 40 tons of coal allotted to the St. Paul Aleuts
under the lease of 1870 barely served to meet their cooking needs. Often
Aleuts were forced to walk miles to collect driftwood for fuel in the middle
of winter. During many years the Aleuts had to purchase additional coal
at high prices from the ACC.
The coal supply to the Aleuts was increased to 160 tons in 1891 and
to 350 tons in 1896 but even with this increased supply, the amount of
coal provided was far from adequate. In 1896, for example, Aleut families
were forced to double up in dwellings to save coal. With their own funds
the Aleuts purchased as much additional coal from the NACC as was available.
191. Insufficiency of Fuel Provided in Government Period. Complaints
concerning the insufficiency of fuel provided continued into the government
period. In 1919 a Pribilof Islands doctor recomended that 75 lbs. of coal
each day be allotted to each Aleut family, but only 40-50 lbs. per day was
available. In 1919 the Aleuts petitioned the Commissioner of Fisheries

for more coal. This request was sumarily rejected.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 130

As larger Aleut houses were constructed in the 1920's and 1930's,

the amount of coal needed for heat was greatly increased.

192. Unavailability of Other Fuels. The Pribilof Aleuts had no

alternative to the use of imported coal as fuel. No trees grow on the

Pribilofs. Little driftwood reaches the islands. Seal blubber had

been used by Aleuts to heat their barabaras, but blubber was sorely

insufficient to heat the Aleuts' frame dwellings. Blubber also is an

extremely acrid-smelling fuel and if stored for long periods often turns

rancid.

193. Dearth of Information Concerning Fuel Necessary to Heat
Pribilof Dwellings. The Commission notes an absence of data which would

aid in establishing the quantity of fuel needed to adequately heat the
111/

Pribilof Aleuts' homes. Neither of the parties estimates a standard
112/
fuel expenditure for the then—existing housing.

gggj Little information has been provided or found describing the
particulars of Aleut housing construction. Factors suchzus the thickness
of the walls, type of insulation (if any), and amount of air space would
be significant factors in developing a standard. The Comission has no
information concerning the heating capacity of the Aleuts' stoves. It

is possible that these stoves were so inadequate as to make the proper
heating of the Aleut dwellings impossible given even an unlimited quantity
of coal. In addition, the Comission has little information concerning
the quality of coal provided the Aleuts; the quality of coal as much as
the quantity may have been responsible for the insufficient heating levels

attained.

112/ Plaintiffs estimate the cost of fuel the Aleuts should have received
'?3E the houses the Aleuts should have received. The Commission feels
this procedure is improper, and feels that each area of insufficiency
should be examined independently. To do otherwise would be to lessen

the relevance of these calculations to the situation that actually

prevailed on the islands.

$2 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 131

194. Standard Fuel Consumption for Pribilof Aleut Dwelling,

1870-1946. One reasonable contemporary estimate of the quantity of coal

 

needed to adequately heat a Pribilof Aleut's dwelling in the 1870-1920

period during the coldest month of the year is 75 pounds of coal each
113/
day.

A reasonable estimate of the quantity of coal needed to adequately

heat Pribilof Aleut dwellings in the years 1921-1946 during the coldest

114/
mnth of the year is 112.4 pounds of coal per day.

 

113/ The record shows that the 60 tons initially provided the Aleuts under
'35s Government's lease with the ACC were but a fraction of actual need.
Even when the amount of coal provided was increased to 350 tons in 1896 -and the number of families had decreased from the 1870's -- the Aleuts
still suffered hardship (P1. Ex. 229, at 6, 7, 8). The 350 tons provided

were equivalent to approximately 60 pounds of coal per day in December,
January, February, and March and 17 pounds per day during the remainder

of the year.

During the winter of 1919, 40 to 50 pounds of coal were distributed
to each family each day. An island doctor recommended that 75 pounds per

day be provided, and the Governmnt agent agreed more coal was necessary
(Pl. Ex. 307).

.L;&/ This is an estimate. The record shows that beginning in the 1910's
the Government began erecting larger houses to replace the cottages built
by the ACC. While we know these houses were significantly larger and
contained more rooms than the ACC dwe1lings,we do not know how much coal
was adequate to heat these homes. The record does indicate that the

larger houses required greatly increased amounts of heat (P1. Ex. 359,
at 5). Given this situation it is reasonable to estimate that fuel need

averaged 50 percent higher than in the 1870-1920 period.

The Commission's calculations as to the quantity of fuel necessary
for an adequate degree of comfort assumes that the quality of coal that
should have been provided is identical to that actually provided.

42 Ind. c1. Comm. 1 132

195. Fuel Needs for Each Month of the Year, 1870-1946. By analyzing

climatological data, fuel need for each month of the year was calculated.
In the years 1870-1920, 75 pounds of fuel per day per family were assumed
to be needed in March, the coldest month, to heat a dwelling to a constant
65° F. Fuel needs were then calculated for the other months assuming that
fuel needs exhibited a one-to-one correspondence with degree heating days.
Fuel needs per day per family are calculated as follows: January — 70.5 lbs.;
February - 69 lbs.; March — 75 lbs.; April - 64.5 lbs.; May - 57.75 lbs.;
June - 42.75 lbs.; July - 35.25 lbs.; August - 32.25 lbs.; September - 36
lbs.; October - 49.5 lbs.; November - 56.25 lbs.; and December - 67.5 lbs.
In the years 1921-1946, 112.5 pounds of fuel per day per family were

assumed to be needed in March, the coldest month, to heat dwellings to a
constant 65°F. Fuel need per day per familv. using the same method of
calculation as for the years 1870-1920, is as follows: January - 105.75
lbs.; February - 113.50 lbs.; March - 112.5 lbs.; April - 96.75 lbs.;

May - 82.13 lbs.; June - 64.13 lbs.; July — 52.88 lbs.; August - 48.38

lbs.; September - 54 lbs.; October - 74.25 lbs.; November - 84.38 lbs.;

and December - 101.25 lbs.

196. Fuel Need Per Month Per Aleut Dwelling, 1870-1946. Coal need

each month for each Aleut family in the years 1870-1920 was as follows:

January - 2,185.5 lbs.; February - 1,949.25 lbs.; March - 2,325 lbs.;

42 Ind. Cl. Com. 1 133

April - 1,935 lbs.; May - 1,790.25 lbs.; June - 1,282.5 1bs.; July 1,092.75 lbs.; August - 999.75 1bs.; September - 1,080 lbs.; October 1,534.5 1bs.; November - 1,685.5 lbs.; and December - 2,092.5 lbs.
Coal need each month for each Aleut family in the years 1921-1946

was as follows: January - 3,278.25 lbs.; February - 3,206.38 lbs.;

March - 3,487.5 lbs.; April - 2,902 lbs.; May - 2,546.03 1bs.; June 1,923.90 lbs.; July - 1,639.28 1ba.; August - 1,499.78 1bs.; September 1,620 lbs.; October - 2,301.75 lbs.; November - 2,531.40 1bs.; December 3,138.75 lbs.

197. Number of Aleut Dwellings on the Pribilofs, 1870-1946.

Information is incomplete on the number of occupied Aleut dwellings during
the period. A reasonable estimate of occupied Aleut dwellings is 82.5 for

the years 1870-1890, 70 for the years 1891-1910, 66 for the years 1911-1920,
115/
and 75 for the years 1921-1946.

198. Cost of Coal Per Ton, 1910-1946. A reasonable estimate of the

cost of coal in the government period, excluding transportation costs, is
116/
$9.76 per ton. Given the lack of information in the record, the cost

of transportation is estimated at $8 per ton. Total cost per ton is $17.76.

 

115/ Data is taken from P1. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at 3-8,.A-28. The average
number of occupied houses for 1870-1890 is taken from 1878 and 1890 figures.
The number of occupied houses during 1891-1920 is assumed to be the number

of families since there were more (or the same number of) dwellings than
families. Th average number of occupied houses in the years 1921-1941

was estimated by averaging the number of St. Paul and St. George dwellings
in 1933, 1940, and 1946, and the total dwellings on St. Paul in 1918 and
St. George in 1922.

116/ The value and amount of coal delivered to St. Paul is listed for 13
Years of the period (Pl. Ex. 719). Quantities delivered are known for
several other years. Applying the figures available over the 37-year
Period and dividing cost by tonnage gives an estimation of $9.76 per ton.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 134

199. Amount and Value of Coal Needed, 1870-1946. The amount of coal

provided in the 1870-1890 period should have been 823.12 tons per year.

In 1891-1910, 698.39 tons should have been delivered each year, in

1911-1920, 658.45 tons should have been delivered, and in 1921-1946,

1,127 tons should have been provided annually.

The value of coal that should have been provided in the 76-year

period is $1,061,204.

The coal needed in the 1870-1890 period is valued at $225,534.88

117/
(see finding of fact Nos. 67, 95). In the 1891-1910 years the total
118/

value of coal is $198,168.22 (see finding of fact Nos. 95, 198). In

the years 1911-1920, $116,940.72 should have been spent on coal (see
119/

finding of fact No. 198). Finally, fuel costs in 1921-1946 should
1207
have totaled $520,560.56 (see finding of fact No. 198).

200. Food, Clothing, and Household Furnishing Provided to the

Pribilof Aleuts Insufficient. The amounts of food, clothing, and

household furnishings supplied to the Pribilof Aleuts from 1870 to 1946

were far below the level required for an adequate degree of comfort.

117/ This is the total of an outlay of $10,700.56 (823.12 tons x $13/ton)
for 20 years plus 1 year of an $11,523.68 outlay (823.12 tons k $14/ton).

118/ This is the total of an outlay of $9,777.46 (698.39 tons x $14/ton)
for 19 years plus an outlay of $12,396.48 (698.39 tons x $17.76/ton) for
1 year.

119/ This is the total of an outlay of $11,694.07 (658.45 tons x $17.76]
ton) for 10 years.

120/ This is the total of an outlay of $20,021.56 (1,127 tons x $l7.76/
ton) for 26 years.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 135

201. Food Deficient in Quantity and Quality. The quantity and

quality of the food made available to the Pribilof Aleuts was very low.
Agents and other government employees often commented that the food
issue was inadequate. Despite knowledge of the inadequate supply of

food the Government had not remedied the situation by the end of the

period in question.

In the latter part of the government period children under 2 years
of age were issued only milk. There were no provisions for issue of fruit
juice, cereal, or vegetables. From 2 to 4 years of age, children were
issued only milk and cereal.

In 1915 Aleut children on St. Paul congregated around the white mess
kitchen after every meal to pick out edible food from the refuse. Twentyfive years later other Aleut children were still begging for food at the

mess hall.

The growth of the Aleut children was stunted by insufficient nourishment. A visiting medical.commission in 1944 found nearly all the Aleut
children were subject to some ailment. Aleut children's teeth were found
to be so poor that 75 percent were expected to have no teeth at age 20.
The cause'of these health problems was laid to the Aleuts' insufficient
diet and lack of vitamins.

202. Adult Aleuts Malnourished. The government food 8Ch¢‘-<11-81¢ 111

1941 for Aleuts lacked essential food items. Moreover, the existence

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 1 136

tof the schedule was no assurance that the Aleuts received even these

items. In 1914 and 1915 when the Navy maintained a mas hall on St. Paul
the entire population of the village congregated around the Navy mess hall

to beg for food.
Information indicates that a day's food for an Aleut might consist

of bread and coffee for breakfast, bread and tea for lunch, and potatoes

and rice for dinner.

203. White Employees Given Best Food. Throughout the government

period white government employees were given much better food than the
Aleuts. There was a small dairy herd on the islands, but the milk
produced was primarily distributed to the white employees even though
Aleuts made up most of the population and had young children very much
in need of fresh milk. In the 1930's and 1940's some vegetables were
grown in a greenhouse on St. Paul,but these went primarily to the whites

and not to the Aleuts who were in greater need of these foods. A number

of reindeer, sheep, and cattle were slaughtered on the islands for meat.
Once again this was predominantly for the benefit of the white employees.

In general the whites enjoyed a food supply far superior to that of the

Aleuts.

204. Seal Meat Insufficient to Feed Aleuts. The Government relied

on seal meat as a food supply for the Aleuts. The Aleuts, however, would

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 137

consume only limited quantities of seal meat (see finding of fact No. 20).
At times, Aleuts went hungry rather than eat seal meat. Inability to
digest seal meat was a common ill.

At one time an employee of the Fish and Wildlife Service considered
the possibility of marketing seal meat but concluded its market would be

limited since it might only be sold to the poorest of the laboring classes

in foreign countries.

205. Clothing Issue to Aleuts Insufficient. Many officials described
the Pribilof Aleuts as being insufficiently clothed. The Aleuts suffered

as a result of this lack of clothing. An agent reported in 1915 that only
one suit of the cheapest clothes was provided for each man each year and
that children after‘the age of three or four had only the scantiest
garments. Items of particular need were footwear and heavy outer costs.
206. Issue of Essential Household Furnishings Deficient. The
Government failed to provide an adequate number of essential household
furnishings, such as beds and stoves. The Government provided only
cooking stoves to the Aleuts. These stoves were of only limited use in
heating the Aleuts' dwellings. The cooking stoves the Aleuts were given
were often in disrepair. A government memo in 1916 instructed that when
an Aleut family needed a new stove, a white employee should get the new

stove and the Aleut family should get the employee's used stove.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 133

Beds and bedding were not supplied in sufficient quantities on the
Pribilofs (see finding of fact No. 177). Often three children were

forced to sleep together in one small bed. Much of the inside house

decorations and furniture were paid for by the Aleuts.

207. Standard For Food, Clothing, and Household Furnishings. Upon

a review of the information in the record concerning foods, clothing, and
household furnishings, the Commission finds that the Aleuts should have
received the same level of food, clothing and household furnishings as

was enjoyed by a wage-earning family in the lower 48 states.

208. Egpenditures on Food, Clothing, and Household Furnishings

by American Wage-Earning Families. Expenditures for food, clothing and

household furnishings by American laboring families for 26 years during
121/
the period in question are as follows:

121/ The following sources were used in the calculation of these yearly
figures: P1. Ex. 706, 707, 708, 709, 715, 716, 701, Vol. II, at 503558. The categories in these charts indicating expenditures for food

and clothing were always used in the calculations. If a separate figure
was reported for expenditures for household furnishings this also was

included.‘ Figures labeled "sundry" or "miscellaneous" were not included.

If a list of food and clothing items was provided all those items were
included.

Certain reports in the government period included figures for both

4 and 5 member families. In this case a figure was calculated for a
4.5 member family, since Pribilof families averaged between 4 and 5

members in the government period. Most other sources consulted were
based on the 4 or 5 member family. when there was more than one source

for a year, an average expenditure was calculated for that year.

209. Average Expenditures for Food, Clothing, Household Furnishings.

The 26 years for which statistics are available measure expenditure levels
of various types and sizes of families in diverse sections of the United
States Qggg finding of fact No. 208). we have used these figures to
calculate a standard for each of she 76 years. In order to arrive at a
reasonable expenditure estimate for these 26 years as well as for the

other 50, the following procedure was used: (1) Taking a known expenditure
figure for a particular year, this figure was converted to an expenditure

value in the 75 other years by virtue of a cost of living index. (The

42 Ind, Cl. Comm. 1 140

cost of living index in the year for which an expenditure value was known
was divided into the cost of living index for that year for which an
expenditure figure was sought. This quotient was multiplied by the known
expenditure to getthe expenditure value. For instance, in 1888 there was
a known expenditure of $282 and a cost of living index of 88 (Pl. Ex.
701, Vol. I, at Ar3l). In order to calculate the expenditure value in
1871-—when the cost of living index was 100--100 was divided by 88 and
this quotient multiplied by $282.) (2) The process of finding an
expenditure figure for each of the 76 years was repeated 26 times——for
each raw expenditure figure available. Thus, the initial result of

these calculations were 26 columns of figures, each containing 76 entries.
(3) Each of the 76 rows were then averaged-26 entries per row—-in order
to find the final yearly expenditure figure. It is this figure that
appears in chart 209—A, column 2, below. (4) Yearly expenditures were

then multiplied by the number of Pribilof Aleut families (column 3) to

find yearly comunity expenditure (column 4).

210. Government Egpenditure Necessary to Provide Adequate Level
of Food, Clothing, and Essential Household Furnishings. The government

expenditure necessary to provide the Pribilof Aleuts with adequate levels
of food, clothing, and household furnishings from 1870-1946 is $3,822,252.
In the 1870-1889 period $1,298,270 should have been spent. In the second

lease period $606,355 would have constituted an adequate expenditure.
122/

In the government period $1,917,627 should have been spent.

211. Pribilof Water Supply Insufficient, 1870-1946. Throughout

the 76-year period, the water supply to the Pribilof Aleuts was insufficient. The Pribilof Aleuts' sources of water were located at
considerable distances from the villages and were at times contaminated.
In the winter difficulty in reaching the sources of water often forced

the Aleuts to melt snow for drinking water. The water supply was

completely inadequate to maintain proper levels of personal or household

cleanliness.

During the government period water became available from central

locations in the villages. These systems were not completed until well

gggl The Commission assumes that the cost of buying and transporting

food, clothing, and household furnishings to the Pribilofs equals the

price paid for these items by consumers in the lower 48 states. Plaintiffs
have asserted that goods on the Pribilofs were valued at wholesale price
plus 25 percent (Pl. Ex. 701, Vol. I, at S*19) but have failed to adequately
support this position. Defendant has not reached the question of the
relationship between consumer expenditures and the cost of providing goods

on the Pribilofs.

42 Ind. c1. Comm. 1 144

into this period. Few or no Aleut homes were provided with inside

plumbing by 1946. Running water and inside plumbing existed on the

Pribilofs in the government period, but these comforts were reserved for

non-Aleut government employees.

212. Standard for Water Supply Construction. The expense of

constructing an adequate water distribution system in the lease periods

123/
would have been $3,937. This is what it would have cost to pipe water

to central village locations both on St. Paul and St. George.
An adequate water system would have cost $16,200 in the government
124/
period. This is the estimated cost of running water lines to each

Aleut dwelling. The total expenditure for an adequate Pribilof water

system is $20,137.

213. Sanitation System Insufficient. The system of sanitation on
the Pribilofs, 1870-1946, failed to meet minimum recognized levels. The
number of outhouses provided was insufficient throughout the 76-year
period. Moreover, these structures were often.i:1an unsanitary and
dilapidated condition. In the government period some privies were built

but the numbers were not adequate for the population. Few or no indoor

123/ This is the expense of building waterworks on each island minus the
25 percent of the cost that it is estimated would have been supplied by
Aleut labor previously compensated (see finding of fact Nos. 188, 214, 218).

'lg£/ This figure includes a reduction of 25 percent from the projected
cost for Aleut labor previously compensated. This figure does not include
the cost of inside plumbing in Aleut houses; expenditures for inside
plumbing are included in the estimates of housing standards.

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 1 145

toilets existed :h: the Aleut residences during the governmnt period.
In 1947 a doctor reported that the sewage system that had been constructed

to connect the non-Aleut government buildings was in disrepair and constitued

a health hazard.

214. Standard for Sanitation. An adequate sanitation system in

 

the lease periods would have required one outhouse for each family. Tye
life of these privies is estimated at 20 years and their cost at $20.l—2/
During the government period a sewage line should have been installed for
each Aleut house in both villages. The approximate cost of materials

and laying the line would be $9,600. Total cost for adequate sanitation
facilities would have been $lO,l40:l£é/

215. Education of Aleuts Insufficient. The educational program
furnished the Aleuts was often criticized, and government officials
admitted its shortcomings. Although a few Aleuts were sent to the
Chemewa Indian School in Salem, Oregon, for high school education,

most children had their education terminated at age 16. Only five or

six grades were offered.

 

125/ 196 outhouses for a total cost of $3,920 would have been needed.

126/ This figure includes a reduction of 25 percent for the value of

Outhouse and sewage construction that is attributable to the value of
Aleut labor (see finding of fact Nos. 188, 211, 218). The standard for
sanitation does not include the cost of indoor plumbing. That cost is

included in the projected expenditure for housing.

216. No Standards Established for Educational Instruction or

Provision of School Supplies. No standards have been established and

plaintiffs do not claim damages for inadequate educational instruction or
inadequate provision of school supplies.

217. Construction and Maintenance of Educational Facilities Inadequate,
1870-1909. The record indicates that the structures built or otherwise
provided for the education of Pribilof Aleut children in the lease periods
were not adequate educational facilities.

218. Standard for School Building Construction and Maintenance: 1870-1909
Six thousand seventy—four dollars should have been spent to erect proper
school houses on the Pribilofs in the 1870's. This sum would have been
sufficient to build and maintain schools on both St. Paul and St. George
with adequate room for pupils and teachers. Four thousand eight hundred

sixty dollars should have been spent on school maintenance. Twentywfive

percent of the cost of construction and maintenance is deducted as that

127/
amount of cost attributable to Aleut labor previously compensated.

The total cost of school building construction and maintenance in the

1870-1909 period should have been $8,200.

 

127/ The standard for Aleut compensation has been considered in finding

Of fact NOS-161-176. It is estimated, based on the available work
force and the amount of construction on the islands that the Aleuts'

labor could account for 25 percent of the cost of construction and
maintenance (see finding of fact Nos. 188, 211, 214).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and all the evidence of
record, the Commission concludes as a matter of law that:
l. Plaintiffs, members of the Aleut Tribe of Indians residing at
St. Paul and St. George, Alaska, had a "special relationship" with the

Government by virtue of the Act of July 1, 1870 (16 Stat. 180) and the

Act of April 21, 1910 (36 Stat. 326).

2. As a result of this special relationship the Government was
obligated to provide a fair compensation and sufficient goods and services
to the Pribilof Aleuts during the entire 76-year period in question.

3. The Aleuts carried on most major endeavors as a community. The
obligation owed by the Government was owed to the Aleuts as a tribe and

not to individual tribal members.
4. The sealskin monopolists, the Government and its private

lessees, reaped profits of approximately $46,418,399 during the 1870-1946

period.

5. The value of compensation, goods and services provided the Aleuts

during the 76-year period was $4,099,949. The value of fair compensation,

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 1 151

goods and services the Government was obligated to provide to the Aleuts
was $15,339,553.

6. Since the United States and its lessees provided the money
equivalent of $4,099,949 to the Aleuts when the obligation was to
provide $15,339,553, the plaintiffs are entitled to a judgment against

the defendant in the amount of $11,239,604, less allowable gratuitous

offsets, if any.
