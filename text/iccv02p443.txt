OPINION OF THE COMMISSION

0'Marr, Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.

The petitioner, The Yakima Tribe of Indians, seeks recovery for

yr} the value of four tracts of land allegedly wrongfully excluded by the

!
defendant in fixing the boundary of the area reserved to said Indians

by the treaty of June 9, l855, l2 Stat. 951. These tracts are referred
to in petition and briefs as A, or Mabton Area, lying east and

,south of the east end of the reservation; B, or Walupt Lake Area,

'5_j lying west of the west line; C, or Ahtanum Area, lying north of the

north boundary; and D, lying southwest of the line extending between

TMount.Adams and Grayback Mountain.

addition to the above, the Indians demand recovery for the
value of the lands within their reserved area, which had been patented
to non-Indian settlers and purchasers who had acquired rights under
the public land laws prior to harch $, 1904, these rights having been

validated by the act of December 21, 1904, 33 Stat. 595, and a small

area of land outside the area covered by the 1904 act.

TRACTS B AND D

We shall first consider and dispose of tracts B, the Walupt Lake

';'J€L Area, lying west of the west boundary, and D, lying southerly of

.f the southwest boundary line, since, as we believe, the boundary line

”-Q affecting these two tracts has been judicially settled.

of the reservation to be a line starting at milepost 51 on the southern

houndary and running northerly along a divide to the headwaters of

Reservation Creek on the northern boundary. This line became known

asfthe Schwartz line because it.was established by an engineer of that
name in l890, and excluded from the reservation an.area west of that

line 357,878 acres reserved to said Indians by the 1855 treaty, as

‘will be seen later.

Because of the dissatisfaction of the Indians as to the location
of the Schwartz line E. C. Barnard was directed to make an investigation of the boundary of the western part of the reserve and his

ield investigation was begun in l898, concluded in 1899, and his

report was completed on January l2, 1900,

(C1. Ex. 31). In this

report, as a reference to the map he prepared and which accompanies
his report will show, he extended the western boundary in two ways,
(1) by a straight line (red) running from the head of the South Fork

Ahtanam river to Spencer Point, thence in a straight line to the Hump,

east.of Mt..Adams, thence in a straight line to Grayback Peak, and

from there in a substantially straight line to milepost 51. ‘Within

this area lying west of the Schwartz line are 293,837 acres. It apparently was in this area that lands patented to the Northern Pacific

Railway Company were located. The Barnard report as to this area was

approved by the Interior Department on April 7, 1900, and was located

on the ground by the survey of Campbell, Germond and Long, of 1907,
and, according to the Secretary of the Interior, it was this area
that was claimed by the Indians when Barnard made his investigation

(Cl. Exs. 35 and 36 at p. 43in each), but Barnard thought they were

entitled to an additional 64,041 acres. This additional acreage must

have been the 16,448 acres in the Ahtanam area and the 47,593 acres
west of the Spencer Point - Hump line, shown on the Barnard map.

The other way (2) he extended the line west of the Schwartz

line as shown by a green broken line which starts at the head of

South Fork Ahtanam.River, thence around Klickatat Divide to Spencer
Point, thence to Goat Rock, thence along the summit of the Cascade
Mountains to the Hump, east of Mt. Adams, and from there on substantially the same line to milepost 51, as previously shown. The

lands within the Barnard green boundary line, which he datcrmin-c to

be'the correct boundary of the reservation, excluded by the Schwartz

line, included the 293,837 acres mentioned above, plus 47,593 acres

The circuit court accepted the Barnard survey and

The decree was
affirmed by the circuit court of appeals.

And at page 365 the court further stated:

There is evidence which may be adduced in corrobo-ration of the testimony of the respective witnesses, but
‘we have referred to enough to indicate the character and

And we have arrived at and announce this con‘gs clusion with full sense of the weight which should be given

to the action of the Land Department in approving the

?:5. = Schwartz survey and the issueiof the patents.

This lantuage in our opinion determined the western boundary line to

be along the summit of the Cascade Mountains, which clearly excluded

«I

Tract B, the Walupt Lake Area, and the line from the Hump, or from a

point on the Cascades north of Mt. Adams through the Hump, to Grayback
Peak, as plainly and effectively excluded tract D as a part of the
reserve, since both tracts are outside the green line shown on the
Barnard map (Cl. Ex. 31) and which he stated in his report in said
exhibit as being the "only logical one,"--that is, the only logical

line, that meets the calls of the treaty, which are, as to boundary

of the reservation covered by the Barnard report:

Along the south tributary (of Ahtanam or,A tah - nam
River) to the Cascade Mountains; thence southerly the main
.ridgeaof said€mountains,ipassing southuand east oftMount
Adams, to the spur whence flows the waters of the Klickatat
and Pisco rivers; thence down said spur to the divide between the waters of said rivers; thence along said divide
to the divide separating the waters of the Satas River
from those flowing into the Columbia River; * * *.

Barnard, in his deposition (Def. Ex. 34, pp. 81 and following)
taken in the railroad case, testified that the ggggn line shown on
his 1900 map was the true line of the reservation and that the
straight line between Grayback Beak and the Hump (this is sometimes

referred to as Goat Butte) was the correct boundary and that indicated

by responsible Indians.

TRACT C - AH$ANAM.AREA

The treaty call as respects tract C reads:

Commencing on the Yakima River, at the mouth of the
Attah-nam River; thence westerly along said Attah-nam

River to the forks; thence along the southerly tributary
to the Cascade Mountains. * * *.

The present northern boundary of the reservation after leaving
the Yakina River to the forks is not in dispute, for all parties

agree that the Ahtanam (Attah~nam) River as far as the forks is the

is that now known as South Fork Ahtanum Creek. The northern boundary
of the reservation which is indicated by dots on the map, plainly
follows along that creek to its source, as shown on modern maps (Def.
Ex. 2), and does not follow the southern fork, Reservation Creek, as
the engineers, Schwartz (Cl. F3. 31, p. l2) and Barnard (Cl. Ex. 31,
pp. 6-9, and maps attached), mistakenly thought. Their error in this
respect is understandable since they did not have before them the
treaty map because it had been misplaced and was not located until
l930. (Cl. Fx. 5 Sup., p. 6). However, while Barnard, in making

his l9OO survey (Cl. Ex. 31, pp. 649) seemed to consider the head

of Reservation Creek as the head of the "South Fork of the Atanum
River," he stated in his report;

Now, in regard to what the Indians expected, they
had for several years previous to the treaty been in the
habit of hunting in the valley of the Klickitat and in
the vicinity of Goat Rocks, which are prominent points,
8,200 feet hight, and a good landmark, and where mountain
goats were numerous; also of making annual excursions to
the vicinity of Walp to gather berries, and a berry patch
is considered a very valuable possession by the Indians.
The Indians would therefore naturally desire to have these

¥ localities included in their reservation.

From the head of the South Fork of the Atanum.River,
as it does not reach the summit of the Cascade by some
20 miles, the boundary line should then follow the divide
around the headwaters of the Klickitat River, passing
over Spencers Point to Goat Rocks, which is on the main
summit of the Cascade Mountains.

(Spencer's Point is at the end of the present straight boundary line
extending westward from the head of Reservation Creek on C1. Ex. No.
l, and east of Goat Rocks). While Chief Spencer seems to have indicated the straight line, Barnard considered the Klickitat divide as

the proper boundary to Spencer's Point, since that divide is a natural

boundary from either the headwaters of Reservation Creek or the South
Fork of the Ahtanum.River by way of Darling Mountain. The Klickitat
Divide does not appear as such on.modern maps (Def. Ex. No. 2) but is
an extension of the Klickton Divide by way of Mount Darling to the
headwaters of Reservation Creek and is plainly shown on Government
topographic maps (Def. Ex. 2) as the part of the divide which extends

west from Spencer's Point to the summit of the Cascade Mountains at

Goat Rocks.

It is, of course, true that all engineers agree that there is
a distance of about 20 miles between the headwaters of the south tributary and the summit of the Cascade Mountains, yet the treaty call
"thence along the southern tributary toiihe Cascade Mountains" requires reaching those mountains and this can.be done, as we have
stated, by fhlldwingxthe divide between the headwaters of the South
Fork of the Ahtanum, on the east side of the divide, and the head-~
waters of the Klickitat.River (which would include the tributaries
thereof), on the west and southerly side of the divide, by way of

Darling'Mountain and Spencer's Point to Goat Rocks,.as stated by

9

ooth engineers, Barnard in 1900 and Wilkes in 1932 (C1. Rx. No. 63).

The call just quoted does not require a straight line from the head
of the south tributary of the Ahtanum to Spencer's Point any more
than from that Point to Goat Rocks which, according to engineers,

Barnard, Wilkes, Calving and Pecore, follows the divide around the

headwaters of the Klickitat River to Goat Rocks. This is a natural

I, boundary, and since the treaty-makers believed, as the map shows,

Mountains it would be a natural and realistic presumption of an inten
to follow a natural boundary to close the gap between the headwaters
of the south tributary and the main ridge of the Cascades, in fact,
the treaty map shows that neither of the two forks of the south tributary of the Ahtanum extend to the summit of the Cascades, so in any
event, it was necessary to close a gap and that was to be accomplished,
as the treaty map fairly shows, by following a spur of the Cascades to
the summit. ’

We conclude, therefore, after consideration of the evidence, that
‘with respect to the Ahtanum Creek area, Tract C, the boundary line of
the land reserved for petitioner by the treaty of June 9, 1855, should
have been placed along the stream.now known as the South Fork Ahtanum
Creek, from its junction with Reservation Creek, to its headwaters,
thence along the crest of the divide by way of Darling Mountain to _
Spencer’s Point; that by fixing the present boundary, extending from.
the junction of Reservation Creek with the South Fork of Ahtanum

Creek, thence up Reservation Creek to its source, and thence on a

1

straight line to Spencer's Point, the petitioners have been deprived

of a large area of land reserved for them by said treaty for the

value of which they are entitled to recover. The part of this area

lying north of the present boundary line, extending from the source
of Reservation Creek to Spencer Point, was determined by Engineer

Barnard to contain l6,448 acres (see map attached to Cl. Ex. 31).
To this acreage should be added the acreage of the area lying be-t.

Creek. If the entire area can best be determined by a computation of

the entire area, Barnard's computation may be ignored.

TRACT.A

That portion of the treaty description involved in the claim

concerning the Mabton area, Tract A, reads:

thence (east) along said divide (separating the waters of
the Satass River from those flowing into the Columbia

River) to the main Yakama, eight miles below the mouth
of the Satass River, * * *.

The Satass-Columbia River divide becomes the Columbia-Yakima
Divide near the town of Empire, Washington, drainage east of the line
between Ranges 21 and 22 flowing into the Yakima River, The range
forming this divide, known as the Horse Heaven Hills, extends eastward
to strike the Yakima River about 23 miles below the mouth of Satass
Creek. It is possible to draw a line south from the Yakima River to
the Horse Heaven Hills passing about two miles east of Mabton situated
on the township line between Ranges 22 and 23, without cutting across
draipage, and it is this line claimant says conforms to the treaty

description. The present boundary line runs south from the Yakima

River on the range line between Ranges 22 and 23 to the township

corner, and then along a line south 38° west to the Horse Heaven Hills.

The dispute centers about the location of the mouth of Satass

Creek in 1855. The Yakima River overflows its western bank in the

northwest portion of Township 9, Range 22, and for centuries Satass

Creek has flowed into it through the resultant flood plain. Both

streanm have by avulsion changed theirrchannels numerous times, and

there exists no positive evidence of where Satass Creek emptied into

the Yakima River in 1855. We are asked to adopt the first known location which claimant says is one established in 1861 by Surveyors
Thomas F. Berry and James Lodge, and which was the first of several
surveys the Government has run in an effort to comply with its treaty
obligation to survey the boundaries of the Yakima Reservation.

Briefly stated, the Berry and Lodge Survey was not tied in with V
any other survey although they crossed the Second Standard Parallel

established in 1860. They did not identify natural objects sufficiently to permit relocation of their line and evidence of it has never been

observed upon the ground. Much opinion evidence has been adduced concerning its point of beginning. We are, however, unable to apply a
plat of their survey to this country with any degree of satisfaction
because with the instruments then available a surveyor would have had
to ford a river to project his line across it, and from any suggested
point of beginning this platted line will cross the Yakima River
several times. The notes do not indicate they did this; reason

argues against this difficult procedure, and good surveying practice
i

requires a surveyor to remain upon one bank of a river. Five years

later, in June of 1866, when surveying the opposite bank of the Yakima
River, Shrveyor Edwin Richardson recorded in his notes that in the
southeast quarter of Section 18 he reaches "a point East of the mouth
of Satass River seen indistinctly through thick willows." His tracing
of its course to the westward is substantiated by a survey of the adjoining township to the west made in 1874 by one Ignacio A. Navarre.

In June of that year (1874), T. 3. Reed surveyed Township 9, Range

22, and platted a slough in the southeast quarter of Section 7,

T Clarke traced Satass Creek across Sections 7 and 8 inla course
if f similar to but not identical with Reed's plat of it, although the

In addition to the above surveys, one Father Wilbur, later the
Yakima Indian Agent, ran aKrough line along the Yakima River in
l358-1850, and some of the Indians then present are reported to
have later said that he began this line opposite a slough in Section
l8, rather than opposite the actual mouth of Satass Creek.

We think the evidence established only that the channel of
Satass Creek was in a state of flux; that the more ancient channel
laid to the north, emptying into the Yakima River in Section 8, but
there is nothing in the record from which we may determine when that

channel was finally abandoned, whether before or after 1855, nor do

we think this materially important here,

Our sole purpose is to°interpret the treaty of 1855 just as the

representatives of claimant‘s ancestors present at the treaty council

interpreted it upon that date. They comprehended the natural calls

of the country but distances in terms of miles yere beyond their

cultural attainments. Hence, to impress upon the treaty description

the white man's system of measurement would but distort it. We must

look elsewhere than to this particular phrase in order to find where

they intended the boundary line to run.

As the Yakima Indian Agent, Father Wilbur controlled as reservation land the area eastward to the site of a ferry across the

‘Yakima River besidethe residence of a negro, Antione, Father

‘Wilbur came to this country in 1853, began teaching in 1860, was

_appointed Agent in 1864, and, excepting only one l6-month period,

served until 1882. His reports show the need to survey the‘western

witnesses also placed Antione‘s cabin at the northeast corner of the

reservation.

The evidence is that the terrain about Mabton is flat, with no

live streams, and the direction of drainage is not apparent in dry

seasons. Engineer Calvin platted the Berry and Lodge Survey from the

field notes, applied it to a map in scale, and said the point of termination of the eight-mile distance below Satass Creek was approximately
one mile and forty-two chains east of the range line between Ranges

22 and 23, which is the present eastern reservation line. From that
point, he drew a line south to the Horse Heaven Hills crossing no
drainage, and this is the line which claimants-now sayLis the true
eastern boundary. Defendant‘s witness, J. P. Kinney, placed the
extreme easternmost point of drainage into Satass Creek in Section

27, Township 9 North, Range 22 East, east of Empire, Washington, but

west of the range line between Ranges 22 and 23. Drainage east of

that point is into the Yakima or Columbia Rivers instead of Satass

Creek, according to his interpretation of the contour maps and

his examination of the country. This does; not conflict with Engineer
Calvin‘s line because Calvin did not attempt to separate the Satass

Creek and Yakima or Columbia River drainage by his line, but merely

to run from a designated spot on the Yakima River south to the Horse

Heaven Hills without crossing any drainage on the way.

If the Yakima Indian Reservation is bounded on the east by “

line between the Horse Heaven Hills and the Yakima River which run;

eastward of all drainage into Satass Creek, there is enclosed within

the reservation the entire water systems of the Pisco and Satass

This we believe was the intent of the treaty parties. Doty's

and Whitford's trips from Walla Walla into the Yakima country immediately before the treaty council would explain the use of a definit

measure of distance intthis one instance.

It was, however, not intended as an inflexible measure for it would be miraculous indeed if

nature should so accurately space her greater objects, but was an

approximation, admirably accurate, of the distance below the then

mouth of Satass Creek, where this dry, level plain gave indications

of being a divide between the water system.of Satass Creek and drainage

into other streams, and lead to the apparently logical conclusion that

n:_it extended to and was an extension of the Horse Heaven Hills.

Governor Stevens described the reservation as extending east to

the crossing over the Yakima below the main fisheries during the 1855

I’

treaty council, and there is considerable testimony of record concerning two main fishing sites, each several miles east of what

claimant asserts is the true eastern boundary._ The only crossings,

I

however, are within the reservation area, and Morgan's Ferry is near

the plain above referred to.

We-conclude the true eastern boundary should fall between the

main ridge of the Horse Heaven Hills and the Yakima River along the

easternmost rim of the Satass Creek watershed.

LANDS VALIDATED BY ACT OF 1904

By the act of December 21, 1904, 33 Stat. 595 (Finding 26), the
Congress recognized the fact that the area lying west of the Schwartz
line as far west as the Barnard and Campbell, Germond and Long line,
comprising 293,857 acres, was part of the Yakima Indian Reservation.
In this large tract bona fide settlers or purchasers had entered upon
27,647.71 acres thereof (Finding 27) under the public land_laws of the
United States, prior to March 5, l904, and patents therefor were issued
Said act of 1904 validated the claims of settlers and

de defendant.

purchasers of said lands and by act, and the issuance of patents there5

tor, the petitioner has been deprived of 27,647.71 acres of its lands

and is entitled to compensation for the value thereof. A list of the

lands so taken appears in claimant's Exhibit No. 70.

LANDS WEST OF THE SPENCER POINT - HUMP LINE

Within the area lying between the line we have referred to above

as the Spencer Point - Hump line, and the line following the summit

of the Cascade Mountains as finally established by the Pecore Survey,
made in l920—24, and officially accepted on August 6, l926, the deiendant issued patents to the Northern Pacific Railway Company for

.,__',_.I ‘_ 

To summarize, we hold that petitioner's claim.for lands lying
within the areas of Tracts.A, B and D must be denied; that defendant
is liable to petitioner for the value of 27,994.15 acreas of their
land, taken as set forth in Findings 26-28, and for the value of
their land lying in that part of Tract C described in Finding l9.

In accordance with the Rules of the Commission, there shall
next be determined the amount of land lying within that part of
Tract C, described in Finding 19, and the value thereof, and the
value of said 27,994.15 acres and the amount of offsets, if an ,
the defendant may be entitled to. An order to such effect will

follow.

The opinion in Yakima Tribe of Indians v. United States,
Docket'No. 47, filed in said cause on.May 29, l953, is changed by
inserting this and the preceding page in place of pp. 2 459 and
