FINDINGS or FACT

 

The Commission makes the following findings of fact:

1. Prior to the treaties hereinafter specifically referred to,
the Cherokee Nation of Indians lived east of the Mississippi river in
parts of Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee. A part of the Fation known

as those Cherokee Indians living in the lower towns became dissatisfied

_ga
because of the encroachment of the whites and the scarcity of game up~

on which they mainly depended for food, and desired to move west of

‘the Mississippi river and continue their hunter life. Complying with

the desires of this part of the Nation, the United States located them
in what is now the State of Arkansas in a territory lying between the
Arkansas and White rivers. See treaties of July 8:Wl817, 7 Stat. 156;
and February 27, 1819, 7 Stat. 195. That part of the Cherokees who
lived in Arkansas and later in the Indian Territory (being now the State
of Oklahoma) became known as the Western, or Old Settler, Cherokees.

p ore dated May
Western Cherokees ceded to the United States their Arkansas lands, and
the United States ceded to the Western Cherokees an area of land located
in what is now the State of Oklahoma. The part of the Cherokee Nation
which remained east of the Mississippi river became known as "The
Eastern Cherokees."

3. After the Western Cherokees moved to Oklahoma, the Eastern
Cherokees decided to move west of the Mississippi river and join the
western group, so by*a treaty between the Cherokee Nation or Tribe of
Indians and the United States, dated December 29, 1835, T Stat. U78,
which treaty was agreed to by the Western Cherokees, the Cherokee Nation

or Tribe of Indians ceded to the United States for a consideration of

five million dollars all of their remaining lands east of the Missis—

}\

Sippi river. This consideration was increased by S£OO,COO by the

(

supplementary treaty of Earch 1, 1836, T Stat. e88. By the treaty of

...3....

1835 the United States ceded to the Cherokee Tribe of Indians 800,000r
acres of land for a consideration of $500,000. The Eastern Cherokees
settled upon the Oklahoma lands formerly occupied by the Western
Cherokees and the 800,000 acres acquired as aforesaid; and following’
the 1835 treaty dissension arose between‘the two factions of Indians
in that the Western Cherokees claimed that they had been drprived of
two-thirds of their Oklahoma lands by the settlement of the Eastern

Cherokees thereon, for which they had received no compensation although

8 the Eastern Cherokees had received $5g600,000'under the treaties of

1835 and 1836.

871, between the United States, the Cherokee Ration. and the Western
Cherokees. and it was agreed that the 800,000 acres acquired by the
treaty of 1835 should become the property of all the Cherokee people,
those east as well as those west, and in order to settle the claim of
the Western Cherokees for their land occupied by the Eastern Cherokees,
they were given one—third of the $5,600;0O0 remaining after certain deductions provided for in the treaty were made.’ The treaty also provided
a formula for determining what part of the $5,600,000 treaty fund should
be paid.the Western Cherokees. The treaty fund was at all times in the‘
custody of the United States and was distributed by it. The Western
Cherokees soon objected to certain deductions from the fund made by the
United States and for many years vigorously protested certain of the

deductions which they had declared to be illegal and not in accordance

with the stipulations of the treaty,

5. This dispute was finally referred to the Court of Claims by
the Act of February 25, 1889, 25 Stat. 69H, by which the Court of
Claims was given jurisdiction to determine what sums of money, if any,
were due from the United States to the Western Cherokee Indians, resulting or growing out of treaty stipulations and Acts of Congress
relating thereto, and pursuant to this jurisdictional act a suit was
instituted and tried resulting in a judgment in favor of the Western
Cherokees, in the sun of $800,386, 1, (See Western Cherokee Indians v.
United States, 21 Ct. Cls. l, as modified by the Supreme Court, 1H8
U. s. h26,’37 L. ed. 509).

5. For the purpose of presenting and prosecuting their claim
against the United States in the Court of Claims, the Western or Old
Settler Cherokees employed attorneys to represent them, and agreed to’
pay such attorneys out of any sum that might be recovered in the suit
a certain percentage thereof, and pursuant to such agreement and at
the request of the plaintiffs, the defendant deducted from the amount
of the judgment the sum of $lU2,HU6.6O and paid, or caused to be paid,
saidanmnnrtto the attorneys who represented the Western Cherokees in
said litigation. The contract for legal services was voluntarily made
by the plaintiffs and the defendant had nothing whatever to do with
the making thereof, and the payment of said sum out of the judgment
fund was with the consent and at the express direction of the plain‘. U
