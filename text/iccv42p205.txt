Docket Nos. 15-P,

POTAWATOMI INDIANS OF INDIANA AND

Intervenors,

V.

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

Defendant.

On June 8, 1978, an interlocutory order was entered herein awarding
the plaintiffs the amount of $1,809,552.57, less any gratuitous offsets
which may be subsequently allowed to the defendant (41 Ind. Cl. Comm.

399, 508). In a letter to the Comission dated July 5, 1978, copies of
which were sent to the attorneys of record for the above-named plaintiffs
and intervenors, counsel for the defendant refers to the interlocutory

award of June 8, 1978, and advises:

"To expedite the entry of a final award in the
above-consolidated cases, the defendant reserves any
claim for gratuitous offsets against the award for other
docketed cases involving these several plaintiffs."

UPON CONSIDERATION of the said letter from counsel for the defendant
and the plaintiffs‘ mtion to enter final award as contemplated by that
letter, which motion was filed on July 13, 1978,

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 205 205

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that, as a final award in full satisfaction
of all claims against the defendant in consolidated Dockets 15-P, 29-N
and 306, plaintiffs and intervenors in these dockets do have and recover
from defendant on behalf of the Potawatomi Tribe as constituted in 1832
the sum of $1,309,552.57, and

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any gratuitous offsets which defendant
could have claimed as chargeable against the award herein be, and the
same hereby are, reserved for defendant to claim in any other docketed

case brought by the same plaintiffs under the provisions of the Indian
Claims Commission Act, 60 Stat. 1049 (1946).

Dated at Washington, D. C., this 14th day of July 1978.
