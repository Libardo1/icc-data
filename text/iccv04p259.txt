0'Marr, Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.

The claim here presented is for the value of a strip of land 516M
feet wide (north and south) and hl.887 miles long, lying immediately
south of the south line of the Lower Brule Reservation as that line was
established by Edwin H, Van Antwerp, a United States Deputy Surveyor,
in l890. and as it has been located since that time.

By the Act of March 2, l889, 25 Stat. 888, which was accepted and

agreed to by the different bands of the Sioux Nation, including the

Lower Brule,pprts of the Great Reservation of the Sioux Nation was
divided among the several bands of the nation. The south boundaryp
line of the reserve set apart for the Brule, is described in the act

as running from where the western line of Presho County intersects

the forty-fourth degree of latitude; "thence on said fortyafourth degree
of latitude to western boundary of township number seventy-two; * *."
This south line, h1.887 miles long, ees located by the 1890 survey 516M
feet north of the true location of the hhth parallel and thus excluded
from the Brule the land between_those linesg and it is the value of this
land the Court of Claims has decided the Brule are entitled to recover.
(125 C. Cls. H39). This excluded land was actually a part of the Lower
Brule Reservation but was considered by both the Government and the
Indians as part of the lands of the Great Reservation of the Sioux, as
established by the Treaty of April 29, 1868, which sere ceded by the Act
of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888. It was not until the General Accounting
Office report of April, 1932 (Plaintiffs' Ex. 1 and Defendant's Ex. 26)
that the error in locating the Uhth parallel was discovered. (105 C. Cls.
725, 809). The excluded lands had long before, and on February 10, 1900,

passed to defendant as part of the ceded lands.

Acreage of‘E:nluded Tract

 

The plaintiffs contend that there are 3H,66H.62 acres in the tract
excluded from the Brule Reservation by the 1890 survey and bases its
claim on the findings and opinion of the Court of Claims in the case,
Sioux Tribe v. United States. No. 0-531 (18~2h), 105 Cu Cls. 725, shich

it has pleaded in its petition herein, and a.report of the General

M 2:

Accounting Office set forth in plaintiffs‘ Ex. 1. The findings and
opinion of the Court of Claims are in evidence herein as Defendant's
Ex; No. 22, and the finding relied upon is No. 37, p. 20, of that

exhibit, in.uhich it is stated that there were 3h,66h.62 acres in the

excluded area, This acreage appears to have been taken from the General

Accounting Office report, part of which is in evidence as Plaintiffs‘
EX. 1 and,Defendant's Ex, 26, and pages U12-hlh of Volume I of thee
report which was offered in the Sioux case No. 531-0 (18-2h), supra.

An examination of the Sioux case (Def. Ex. 22) shows that the case
involved the consideration of the claims of seven different Sioux groups
on reservations created out of the Great Reservation of the Sioux Nation
by the Act of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888. Of the seven cases there involved, all, except the Lower Brule which is 0-531 (22), were set up in
the original petition, but the Brule claim was not filed until after the
time limit under the jurisdictional act had expired (see pp. 77-78, Def.
Ex. 22, 105 0. 01s. 725, 809) and the court decided with respect to the
Brule claim (pp, 77«-78, Def, Ex, 22, 105 0, C13. 725, 809):

The amended petition was filed more than five years
after approval of the jurisdictional act. We are therefore
without jurisdiction of this claim by the Lower Brule Indians.
It may be stated, however, that as a matter of fact it does
not appear that any portion of the 3h,66h.62 acres, or any of

the money received therefrom has been taken or misappropriated
by defendant to its own use.

So, neither the findings above referred to nor the decision are res judicata.

Since the above decision and the preparation of the G,A,O, Report in

the former case, the Coast and Geodetic Survey has determined that the

southern boundary of the reservation, as determined and monumented in 1890,

is hho 00¢ 51" and that the true location of the uhth parallel is 516M
feet south of the southern boundary and that the excluded area extended
between the longitude of the eastern limit of 993 31‘ 31“ and the longitude

of the western limit of 100° 21' 57“, a distance of hl.887 miles. (Def.

The Coast

Ex. 29). use, the excluded area was 516M feet by u1.8s7 miles.

and Geodetic Survey computed this area as containing 26,218 acres, "based

upon a standard section of 690 acres." There is a difference between this

computation and.that of the Bureau of Land Management as will be hereafter
discussed.

For the purposes of this case, the Bureau of Land Management has
prepared data for determining the acreage of the excluded strip.

Defendant's Exhibit 28 is a tabulation of all land disposals within
the strip and they aggregate 26,235.56 eeree. but it e111 be noticed that
the description of each disposal and the acreage thereof is in accordance
with the plats of the survey thereof approved March U, 1891, (Def, Exs.
31v37). These disposals, therefore, include lands lying south of the hhth
Parallel as it is located by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the North
half of Sections 7 to 12, inclusive, of Townships 106 North of Ranges 7}
to 79 West of the 5th P.M. This is shown by defendant‘s Exhibits 31 to
37, inclusive. In these exhibits, the Bureau has shown the location of
the uhth parallel with respect to the half section lines and has computed
the acreage of the "fractional sections north of this [§hth7 parallel of

latitude.“ (Letters of November 25, 1953, and January 21, 195M, Def. Ex.

37).

and the location of the nuts parallel, as determined by the United states

The total acreage lying between the monumented south reservation line

M 2::

Coast and Geodetic Survey, is 25,968.2h acres, as shown by the plate.

This is the correct acreage of the area of the land erroneously excluded
from the Brule Reservation by the 1890 survey and for which the plaintiffs
are entitled to recover, since it is only the lands lying north of the
hhth parallel and south of the monumented south line of the reservation

that were excluded.

Valuation Date

 

The parties are not agreed as to the date upon which the value of
the excluded lands should be determined. The plaintiffs insist that the
lands should be valued as of February 10, 1900, while the defendant contends
they should be valued as of February 10, 1890.

The Act of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888, set aside a portion of the
Great Reservation of the Sioux Nation to seven groups of that nation and
created a separate reservation for each. The reservation for the Lower
Brule is described in Section 5 of that act. All the lands of the Great
Reservation outside the several reservations set aside for the separate
groups were restored to the public domain (except certain parts not
material to this case) by Section 21 of that act and were to be disposed
of by defendant for the benefit of the Sioux Nation.

The lands ceded to defendant by the Act of March 2, 1889, aggregated
about 9,500,000 acres shich included the 2§,968.2h acres of lands ex»
eluded from the Brule, Since the error in excluding these lands was not
discovered until the General.Accounting Office report was made in l932 0

(see 105 0. Ole. 729, 809), the defendant treated the excluded lands as

142..

Part of the public domain and began disposing of them as early as 1892 and
continued to do so until 1911, when the last entry was made. (Def. Ex. 28).

Section 21 of the Act of March 29 1889, provides;

That all the lands in the Great Sioux Reservation outside
of the separate reservations hereingdescribed are hereby
restored to the puplic domain * * Lpith certain exceptions

not pertinent hergf.

The section then provides for the sale of the ceded Sioux lands to settlers
at specified prices for the first ten yearsg that is, from February 10,
1890, amen the act became effective, to February 10, 1900, for the benefit
of the Indians.

As stated above, the Government contends that by the first part of
Section 21, quoted above? all the lands outside the reserved parts sore
“restored to the public domain" and since that part of the act became
operative on February 109 1890, there was a change in status of the ex—
cluded land as of that dateo

There is much merit in the Governmentis argument, if the quoted
clause is considered alone, but an exanination of Section 21 shows that
by its provisions the Government first undertook for a period of ten
years the disposition of the excluded lands to actual settlers under the
provisions of the homestead lane at prices ranging from $1.25 per acre
for the first three yearsa $.75 per acre for the next two years, and
fifty cents per acre for the remaining five years. During this tenr
year period the defendant was plainly acting for the Indians and was
obligated by said provisions to dispose of the excluded land in the
manner and for the prices fixed. To carry out such contract it was

necessary that there be an extinguishment of Indian title to such of

the lands as might be disposed of to settlers during the ten-year periodo
This was accomplished by the provisions which restored the lands to the
public domain.

Were the provisions of the section above referred to the only ones
contained in section twenty-one, we would have no difficulty in holding
that Indian title to the excluded lands, undisposed of on February 10,
1900, passed to the United States on February 10, 1890. But, as respects
the purchase of the lands by defendant, which were not sold on February
l0, 1900, Section 21 provides: “That all lands herein opened for settlement under this act remaining undisposed of at the end of ten years from
the taking effect of this act shall be taken and accepted by the United
States and paid for by said United States at fifty cents per acre * 9
and said lands shall thereafter be part of the public domain of the United
States, to be disposed of under the homestead laws of the United States
and the provisions of this act; * °.” Here are special and separate
provisions relating solely to the acquisition of the unsold lands by
defendant. These provisions expressly require the Government to take,
accept and pay for the unsold lands remaining on February 10, 1900, and
there follows the provision that “said lands shall thereafter be part
of the public domain of the United States.“ Obviously, this language
must be given precedence over the general provisions of the first
sentence of Section 21 and interpreted to intend that the Indian title

to the lands acquired by the Government passed on February 11, 1900, and

not on February 10, 1890.

Value of Excluded Lands

The value of the excluded lands is fixed by defendant's appraisers
at 67 cents, and by plaintiffs‘ appraisers at upwards of $8.00 per acre
as of February 10, 1900. It is obviously impossible to reconcile the
figures of the two sets of Valuers used by the respective parties.

The parties have not deemed it necessary to offer in evidence the
mass of available evidence having an important bearing on the question
of value of the Brule lands in controversy, so we have been compelled
to extend our investigation beyond the meager evidence contained in the
record before us.

In the former case (Def. EX. 22, being Court of Claims C~53l, 105
0. C18. 725) there was presented a comprehensive report of the land disposals of the Great Sioux Reservation under the Act of March 2, 1889,
Only part of this report (Pet. Ex. 1 and Def. Ex, 26) was offered here,
but that report shows that of the 9,508,hl9 acres opened for settlement
under the 1889 act (Vol. I, G.A.0. Report of April 12, 1932. pp. M05-8)
only 1,0hU,727 acres of the Sioux lands had been entered between
February 10, 1890 and February 10, 1900, and that figure included 135,826
acres of confirmed Indian allotments outside the reserved areas. And on
February 10, 1900, there remained in the ceded area 7,251,592 acres of
unappropriated land (Vol. I, G,A.0. Report, pp. hl0~Mll) outside the
excluded Brule lands, which could have been acquired by any settler at
the nominal price of fifty cents per acre between 1895 and 1900. That

report further shows at page M10 that between February 10, 1890 and

February 9, 1893, Hl0,835 acres were entered at $1.25 per acre; during

1; 2‘

{:1

the next two years, 238,56U acres were entered at $0.75 per acre, and
during the last five years only 259,501 acres were entered at fifty
cents per acre. So, deducting the confirmed Indian allotments, only
about 900,000 acres of opened Sioux lands were appropriated by settlers.
And, as the undisputed evidence shows, only 1851 acres of the excluded
Brule lands were entered during the ten-year period.

The only logical conclusion that can be reached from this record
is that the Brule lands had small market value on February 10, 1900,
and that the values placed upon them by the Plaintiffs’ experts are
fanciful. Moreover, it is hardly likely the Government would have
opened this, as well as other ceded Indian land, for settlement without
payment, as it did by the Act of May 17, 1900, 3l Stat, l79, had there
been a demand therefor after 1895, even at the nominal price of fifty
cents per acre,_

On the record in this case and the evidence outside the record,
which we have referred to above, we believe the Brule excluded lands did
not exceed in value seventyhfive cents per acre on February 11, 1900,
or sixty-five cents per acre on February l0, 1890, We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs are entitled to an award for 25,968.21! acres
of Land at seventy—five cents per acre, or the'sum of $l9,h76Bl8.

The plaintiffs contend that no part of the excluded lands were
paid for by the Government, also in their brief they agree that there
were erroneously added to the Lower Brule Reservation on the west side
3763.55 acres (being tracts 167 and 168 of Pltfs. Ex. 2 herein — Exhibit

.A in the former case), which need not be compensated for, that is, they

have deducted that acreage from the amount they are claiming compensation

for,

As to payments which may be due from the Government, they will be
determined shen we consider offsets.

And as to_the deducted acreage, 3763.55 acres, the defendant has
not yet made claim therefor, except as a part of the 32,6hh acres included in the triangular area (Def. Ex. 20) shich me. in effect, denied

in this case by our former decision. ,See also Court of Claims opinion,

125 C. Cls. H39, hh3—h. There seems to be little doubt but that the
tracts 167 and 168 are outside the western boundary of the Lower Brule
Reservation as fixed by Section 5 of the March 2, 1889 act, and that such
lands were erroneously included as part of the reserve; however, whether
such included lands may properly be considered as an offset or counterclaim will have to await our determination of the offsets, next to be

disposed of at a hearing thereon.
