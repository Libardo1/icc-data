Witt, Chief Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.

Petitioner herein, The S'IC1.aJ_lam (also known as Clallam) Tribe of
Indians, asserts a claim against defendant for an undeterr::.;L.ned amount of
land based upon the claim o:£'i aboriginal possession and an unconsoior.abl
consideration which petitioner alleges was paid 1‘ or such lands that were
taken by defendant under the terr:-.:.—: f the Treat; of Point I-Sc Point (3.2

Stat. 933; II Kapp. em).

The defendant admits that "the so-called S‘E~I].a3_'I.a.m Tribe and

other tribes and hands“ entered into such treaty (Dft's ans., par. 7)

but denies that petitioner is a "tribe, band, or otheriidentifiable group
of American Indians." (Dft's ans. , par. 2). There were no boundaries
set under the Treaty of Point No Point‘ so far as individual groups

were concerned. Defendant simply took a cession of a large area of

land from four groups of Indians, upon which petitioner bases this
action.

The issues for determination in this case are limited, in part,
by the stipulation of the parties to the questions of (1) capacity of
petitioner to maintain this action under the Indian Clairrs Commission
Act (60 Stat. 1011.9) and (2) what area, if any, did. petitioner's ancestors
e:-:...l*.:s .'.'=.rel'3' occ~ pg; 1' Tr. '23.} . ad 'tionally, there also -arises, incident to the determination oi‘ petitioner‘s capacity to sue, the question
of whether or not there was a merger of the Chimakum Tribe with the
S'Klallam Tribe. Although petitionerohas no where alleged such merger
oi‘ these .tri‘oes in the pleadings, notwithstanding this, petitioner in
its requested find@ of fact No. 12 specifically requests this acmmission to find such merger did occur and that the nS'ICLaILa_1n Tribefis
thus entitled to claim Chiznakum Territoi ." i
The “Chem-a-kun Tribe“ was a party tothe signing, January 26, l8SS,
of the Treaty of Point No Point and was recognized as such in the treat3»"s
prea:-‘able.
The Chimaw were a once powerful war-like tribe of the Puget

Sound area. Their lands were mentioned ‘by the early writers and shown

<H1ear1y maps as being the Port Townsend to Port Ludlow Bay area of

the Quimper Peninsula. Their numbers were greatly reduced by wars with

the Schohomish and only a remnant of the once powerful tribe survived
after these wars in 1850. Earlier attacks of small pox disease in the
1830's had taken a great toll on Chimakums. Thus, they were reduced

to a population of about 100 in 1855. (Stevens' Report, Map 187,

Tube 1033, Office of Indian Affairs, National Archives).

The Chimaknm country was taken possession of by the S'Klallams

in about 1855 to 1857 and their people became subjects of the S'Klallam
Tribe.

(Stevens' Report, l85h). It is, therefore, our opinion that

petitioner has the right to assert any Chimakum claim in this action

because they became merged into the S'Klallam prior to the rat
of the Treaty of Point No Point, but after the treaty had been signed.
Taking this View of the time element of such merger, which we believe the evidence adequately reflects, of the Chimakums into the
S‘Kla1lams, only the S'Klallam Tribe has legal status today to present
their claim, since no other entity is, or has been, in existence to
represent them since such merger in 1857. (House Report No. 2680, 83d
Congress, 2d Session; I Tr. pp. 23-2h).
The S’Klallam population was variously reported in treaty times
as between 800 and 1500 living in from eleven to twenty villages between Clallam Bay and Part Townsend. The Chimakum numbered from 70 to

L100 in treaty times and inhabited an area from Port Discovery, including

Port Townsend and Port Ludlow Bay. Chimaknms jointly occupied the Port
Gamble area, across_the Hood Canal from Port Ludlow, together with Skom

komish and S‘Kla1lam Indians. {III Tr., pp. ?-88),

This Commission upon a previous hearing overruled defendant's
plea of five year limitation, and permitted petitioner to attach
an amendment to its original petition thereby enlarging its boundaries n
of land areas originally claimed to the south and east. This amendment was filed.with the Commission on November l5; 1955, and reads as

follows:

Comencing at the mouth of the Hoko River, thence to
the town of Sappho; thence to the peak of Mt. Olympus;
thence to the peak of Mt. Anderson; thence to the north
point of Quilcene Bay; thence along the shoreline of
Bolton Peninsula to Dabop; thence along the shoreline
of Iondos Peninsula which is also the east shoreline

of Dabop Bay, to Oak Head which is the southernmost point
of Iondos Peninsula; thence to Hazel Point; thence to
Bangor; thence along an east-west line to a point middistant between.Hoods Canal and Liberty Bay; thence
northwestward on the divide between Hoods Canal and
Puget Sound to Foulweather Bluff; thence to Liplip
Point; thence to Fort Flagler; thence to Wilson Point;
thence along the south shore of the Strait of Juan de
Fhca to the mouth of the Hoko River which was the place
of  0

Thereafter, petitioner on July 6, 1956, filed a disclaimer to certain

lands west of Mt. Olympus which are claimed by the Quileute Tribe in

Docket No. 155.

Petitioner maintains that it had aboriginal possession of the abovedescribed area and ceded an undetermined amount of land under the Point
No Point Treaty of January 26, 1855.

The circumstances surrounding the negotiation and execution of the
Treaty of Point No Point on January 26, 1855, are well known and the
difficulties of resolving the boundaries of the tribes involved in such

cession are discussed by Chief Justice Booth in the Court of Claims

The United States. The beneficent policy of Congress set forth in

the statute creating our jurisdiction enjoins us to depart from the
purely legal considerations of that opinion into the most difficult
questions of equitable standards of conduct between the Indian parties

and the Government of the United States, and the fixing of aboriginal

boundaries and definable areas, if any, are found exclusively occupied.
The evidence before us is replete with references of early e:;::plorers, adventurers, missionaries, ethnographers, and Government men

The density of th forest adjoining the narrow flatlands along

the southern shores of the Strait of Juan de Fuca prevented any
extensive use of the interior by the sea-oriented S‘Klalla.ms. The
flablands of the Strait of Juan de Fuca were four or five miles an
at the mouth of the Dungeness River and here were the largest villages
of S'Klallam in aboriginal times. Stetlum (Jamestown) had a population
Of 8D0‘i1‘C- 170, and Sequin, about lOO mople. At Port Discovery, as at
Clallam Bay, the flatlands are narrox-2' and the land rises more sharply

from the shore line. The flat lands at Clallam Bay are about one-half

mile wide and about one mile wide at Discovery Bay. (Dr. Carroll L.

Their subsistence was from the shell fish, salmon, clams and otmr sea

communication between 5’Klallam villages. There were potlaches and
winter ceremonies held between all of their villages, and also ctween
Clallams, I-Eakahs, Chemims and Sko-kc-mish Indians. Host generally
these ceremonies iwere held in the Port Gamble area and adjoining areas

at the north end.of the Hood Canal during the winter months. Like
other Indians of the Puget Sound.area, Nooksackg Muckleshoot, Skokomish,
Hakahs and.others, the S'Klallam.villages'were autonomous in.political
character. They practiced.exogamy between tribes; but were not bound
by political control outside their family and village life. The Chimakums
occupied the Qnimper peninsula area and spoke the Chimakum.language
prior to their merger into the 5'Klallam Tribe.

The S’K'1::'l‘I.-zms had a central chief ‘ont his.“ function were__m.‘ore like
the social prestige of middle twentieth.century monarchs than_the substantial authority wielded by the Indian.chiefs of eastern parts of the United

tates.

The Indian signers to the Treaty of Point to Point represented four
groups of Indians and no effort was made to allocate boundary lines

within the ceded land.area among these Indians.

This Commission stated in the Nooksack case and repeated in the
Muckleshoot case (also involving Puget Sound claims) at page 67? (and

cited by the Court of Claims with approval in the Chehalis case) as

* * * it is extremely difficult to establish facts after

the lapse of time involved in matters of Indian litigation.

In attempting to establish boundaries and.occupancy on the
basis of fragmentary'facts and often uninformed opinions

and the work of ethnologists who must of necessity base their
conclusions upon.mnch the same information, it becomes necessary to take a common sense approach basad.upon experience
with matters of this nature. * a % (Snake or Paiute Indians v.

United States, 125 C. Cls. 2&1, 25h).

‘we have found.that petitioner is an identifiable tribe of Indians,
that they merged.with the dhimakun Tribe in aboriginal times, at least
before the cession of their lands to the United States became effective,

and that there is no evidence in this reccrd.with any degree of certainty

as_to the location of petitioner‘s exact boundaries, as such. Petitioner‘s

general boundaries Vere the Hoke River on the west, the Admiralty inlet
on the east, the sttatt Qt Juan de Fat; tn the ncrth, and the foothills
of the Olympic Mountains on the south. ‘hut the Skokomish, Quests,
Quileutes, Hoh and other Indians freely used the areas of the Olympic

iMountains for hunting of deer, elk:and.bear, together with a few hunters

of the S‘Klallams.

«L.The 5‘Klallam Tribe liued in about a dozen villages within a contiguous area. Each village used a.rather small area of_land.surrounding
it for root gathering and berry picking. Larger areas were, of course,
used to fish, hunt, and dig clams. Other tribes frequently used these
areas surrounding the imnedicte village areas, more frequent1y'they were
guests and kinsnen of the 5‘Klallan. These were “permissive users“ and
not "users in common" with the S‘Klallam. This Indian practice of land

usage by Puget Sound Indians has been noticed by the Connission in the

11"‘

previous cases of this area where we have taken cognizance of the common

~9ties of indions in this area, land uses, their generally loose sense
of property ownership and spirit of independence compared to the
political cohesion and organization.characteristic of Indians in.the
eastern part of.‘ the United States.

The S'Klallam Tribe of Indians occupied certain portions of the

northern part of the Olympic Peninsula from time immemcrial along the
