the trade routes and portages along the Fog and Hisconsin Rivers. Follow-I--oq

ing deleats inflicted upon tribes of the Illinois Confederacy, the Fox also

asserted at various times control over the trade routes and portages along

u-u.

the Chicago and Illinois nivers. In l7l2 a war commenced between France

and the Fox Tribe largely over the control of these trade routes which lasted

until l75l.
8. After sustaining several defeats from the French in the early l730‘s,

the remainder of the For sought and received the aid of the Sac tribe. Thereafter, the no tribes usually acted in concert and became known as the Confederated or United Tribes. In l73k, the combined tribes to avoid the French

moved.west of the hississippi and entered Cession l75. The Fox and Sec Tribes

togeth r, as the Sec and Fox Kation, continued with the Sioux to be th

dominant Indian nations along the Eississiooi River between the Illinois and

‘.09

nissouri Rivers and the'Eisconsin River. 'hnile a majority of the members of

the Sec and Fox Nation apparently returned in the latter l730's and early

l7hO’s to their summer villages along the Eisconsin River and in the vicinity

"5 -w

of Green zayy it is probable that a small number of the Nation remained behind

in permanent settlements along both sides of th Hississippi River.

9. ?he members of the Sacs and Fox Ration who then lived along the

Wisconsin River and in the vicinity of Green Bay commenced in the l760’s to

D

return to the Kississippi River. Auguste Chouteau, writing in ldlé, gives

the folloxing account of this movement:

* * * * The Sacs and Foxes finding these Indians (the Illinois Indians
compelled to leave their country and in no situation to prosecute the
war, left their vill*ee on the Cuisco.sin gradually descended the

' ' .‘ ~ settled on Rock river, twenty one years after
the Potowatonies £ their allies had settled on the Illinois River.

The Foxes, or rather a hand of then, slso removed, in the same time,
to a place called the Spanish Kines (Duouque‘s) and no other Tribe
having opposed them they have for a long time continued in the uninterrupted possession of that tract of country which is bounded on the
East by th— Hississippi river, on the South by the Country of the
Illinois Nation; on the west by the dividing ridge that separated

the waters of the Hissouri % Kississippi rivers, and on the Korth

by the count-’ of the Sioux. (The area described 'ncludes Cession
175)

l0. Zn the l760‘s and throughout the period involved in this proceedI1-J

ing, the economy of the Sac and ox Nation was based on agriculture carried

on at its summer villaces, hunting and trapping. Guns, ammunition, traps,

metal equipment, cl thing, 2 d other essential supplies were obtained by

0%

members of the sac and Fox Nation principally through barter of furs.

ll. Extensive use of Cession l?5 was made by the Sac and Fox xation

\

in the oeriod between the l7€C's “rs l832. In addition to other smaller

C I ‘9villages and hunting encampments there were at least six important Sac and

Fox summer villages located in Cession l75, along or near the Mississippi

River and extending from the north to the south hcundaries of the Session.
Agriculture and subsistence hunting were conducted in the neighborhood of

l3. Sometime after 1800 an increasing number of the Sec and Fox

depended at least in port on lead mining for their living. A ready market

existed for the lead which they orodnced. In 1822, Sac and Fox agent

18. The Fox village located near the present City of Favenport,
Iowa, and opposite the Sec village of Saukenuk in Illinois on the Rock
River was for a time the principal village of the Fox Tribe. The first
rspecific mention of this village (sometimes known as Husquakenuk) is made
by Lt. Pike in l805, although-the village rad undoubtedly been occupied br members of the Sac and Fox Nation for a number of years prior
to 1805 and possibly as early as the 1730's. ‘The village, which was
continuously occupied until l832, is reported by Forsyth (1817), by
Tanner (1919) and by Hajor Harston (1820).

19. In 1829 the Fox Indians moved their village located east
of the Xississipoi River near the mouth of Rock River to the west side
of that river near the present town of Euscatine, Iowa. This village,
which was sometimes referred to as Eapel1o‘s village, was the principal
Fox village from 1829 until l?32.

20. A large Sac village was established on the Iowa River in or
near Cession l75, some time during the l7?O'So This village is subsequently identified by Reward (l?9?), Lt, Pike (l°O5l, and Elondeau (lFl3)L
This particular village ma? ha'e ceased to exist for a few years com»
mencing about 1818; however, when the Sac were forced to abandon their
Principal village of Saukenuk on the Rock River in 1928, a new village
was established a short distance up the lows Fiver outside the boundaries
Of Cession 175 but within the reservation created by the Treaty of 1932,
known.as Keokuck's reserve, and described as Royce‘s Cession 225.

21. The sauthermost summer village of the éac and Fox Ration in

=“3510E 175 was located at a place t?cn krswn as ?lint Creek or Flint

Vifls, near the present city of ?ur1ington, Iowa.‘ This village was in
existence from approximately l803—l8OQ to 193“. It is identified by
Sche serhorn (1812) as a place for trade, by ?orsyth (1824) by étweter
{l?29) and again by Forsyth (1933).

22. At various times in the period l?65~l?32, there were also a
number of other smaller villages of the Sac and Fox Kation located in
Cession l?5.

23. Other villages of the Sac and Fox fation in this perioé located
outside but near the boundaries of Cession l?5 include a small Fox village
located in 181? north of Cession l?5 near the mouth of the upper Iowa
River: a Fox village on the east side of the Eississippi River opposite
the mouth of Turkey River; the famous Sac village of Saukehuk an& the

0 I

outh of the Rock River st F0 k Island, Illinois;

I
I’-3

Fox village both near the
a Sac village on the east sice of the Kississippi River near gquaxka,
I11iFOiS; the village ooposite the south of the Des Hoines River at ?srt

Edwards near Uarsaw, Illinois; and the village on t.e west side of the

if .

Eississiopi River near the mouth of the Zoo L3lheS River and the south

av

boundary line of Session 175.

EU. The Sac and ?ox Ration claims ownership of all and use 0: all

of Cession 175 from at least 1765 until the ?“eaty of l932. in int=rcst in
and joint use with Sec std Eox of the part of Tession l?5 southwest of a
line o~awn from a point where the western houndary line of the Session
crosses the ied Cccar River to a point on the Xississippi Hive: about

five miles northeast of tle gresent tzwn or Lusoatine, Iowa, is claimed

by the Iowa.

25. The Iowa Nation commenced to use the south part of Cession 175
after moving from the Missouri River to the Des Hoines and Mississippi
Rivers about 1765 in order to be more convenient to St. Louis traders.
The principal hunting country of the Iowa Ration continued to be outside of Cession 175 to the south and west of a major Iowa village located
on the Des Eoines River approximately 120 miles from its mouth. The south
part of Cession 175 was used by members of the Iowa Nation to reach the
traders located along the Mississippi River. For a time, Iowa villages
were located in or near that area and subsistence hunting and agriculture
were conducted in the neighborhood of these village locations.

26. after moving to the Des Noines and Mississippi Rivers, the Iowa

Nation soon bec~~~ allied "‘

the larger and stronger sac and Fox Nation
and joined it in wars against the tribes living along or near the lower
Missouri River. The population ratio between the Sac and Fox Nation and
the Iowa Nation in the period involved in this proceeding would appear to
be in the order of from 5% or 7 to one at the maximum, to 5 to h% to one at

the minimum. Lt. Pike described the wars and alliances of the Iowa Ration:

* * * * the same as those of the Sauks and Renards, under
whose special protection they conceive themselves to be.

a period of bad feeling developed between the 3ac and Fox and I we Kations,
which resulted in the Iowa Eation lcavirg its major village on t?: Les
Moines River 120 miles from its mouth. Subsequently the Iowa Kation wee

induced to return to this village but the nation remained there only a

short time and in l?23 moved this village further west to the Grand River.

......--u. . .. .-—. ‘_.:,__...__..-.. .. ----~——._,...~.—¢—..........--q—--.--u---u--~—----'-after 1823 or l82u, members of the Iowa Ration no longer used or occupied
any part of the lands in Cession 175.

28. In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, there were
several observations by French explorers of Iowa Indians on or near the
Mississippi River. About l765 the Iowa Nation moved their main villages
from the Missouri River to the Des Hoines, Iowa and Mississi.pi Rivers
at the request of French traders Chouteau and Laclede: who were associated in the fur trade above St. Louis. The Iowa Nation continued to
hunt in all of the area south of the Des Moines River and west to the
Missouri River in hunting areas they had traditionall used for several
years.

29. From about 1762 to 1912 a large part of the Iowa Nation was
located in three villages on the Kississippi River. One village was
established on the west side of the Hississippi River at the mouth of
the Iowa River. Another village was located near the mouth of the Iowa
River on the east side of the Hississippi River. A t?ird village was
situated opposite the Bee Eoines River on the east bank of the Mississippi
River.

30. The Iowa Ration remained in the southern part of Cession l?5
as late as 1822-1823 in the neighborhood of Ft. Edwards which was located
%on the Mississippi River at the mouth of the Des Moines River.

31. The Iowas were in the habit of making continuous usage of the
land in Cession l75 in a belt eastward from their major village on the
Des Hoines River about 125 miles up from its mouth. The Iowas used the

environs of their summer villages for crops, food hunting, travel to their

hunting grounds and the rivers were used as trade routes.

32. During the period from approxiuately 1?65 to 1812, the Iowa

Nation hunted for furs in their traditiona; hunting grounds to the southwest

of Cession 175 and these traditional hunting grounds were bounded as foilowsz

the E88 Noines River.

33. As of 1303-1803 the Iowa and See and Fox jointly used to an

eonal extent the portion of Cession 175 _ving southwest of a line drawn

3%. Durinr the period between 186’ and the conclusion 0: the her of
1812, the Iowa Kation largely withdrew from the aforementioned portion of
C€5Si3n 175: Partly as a result of actions by the defendant. In 1812, the
United States required the Indians including the Iowa Eation to remove
themselves from the Mississippi River area and move to the mouth of the
Grand River on the Hissouri River to avoid their being 'nvo1ved in the
events of th war of 1812. efter the conclusi n of the her of 1812, a

portion of the Iowa hation returned to the aississiopi River rea and to

The Iowa Ration did not participate in and had no connection

53. The governing bodies or Chieis Councils of .ne Sac and iox tribes
were comprised of representatives of he several clans into xlich each tribe
was divided. Each tribe had its can Chiefs‘ Council and, cwenever the sac
and Fox Kation as a whole was concerned, tiers would usuallu be separat~
councils and then a consultation between the tao tribes or occasi sally
the two tribes would have a joint council meeting together. In addition
to tue clan chiefs, a number of principal men who had special followings
or special skills or reputations usually sat with the Chiefs’ Councils of
each tribe. The Chiefs‘ Council would be responsible for official action
taken oy the tribe in connection with any public affairs and treaty councils
and possessed a number of specific functions concerning karfare. The p wer
9f_the Chiefs’ Councils was subject to the important limitation that the
Councils did not rave at heir disposal police or military power or other

GI-I

authority to enforce their acts and decisi us. in eneral, the acts and

decisions of the Criefs' Councils could be enforced only by discussion
and persuasion in which the traditional respect accorded such acts and

the powers of the Chiefs’ Councils of the Sac and Fox hation:

* * * * was v ry much limited because it didn’t have any
sort of police or natural army which could act as an
executive arm. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * (Tr. 3?2)

Dr.‘¥allace further consented that the Porer to govern in the Sac and
Fox Ration was:

* * * * very slight in comparison n’th the capacities of

a government in our own society, because as I said, they
did not have access to police poser. They could not function for inter-tribal matters as a court. They only had
the p wers of persuassion and recommendation, and it made a
great strain upon them uhen they in contact with the whites
found it necessary to try to assume certain p ears of control which weren‘t charact ristic of an aborigine.

It is an interesting process to observe how the Sec council
in particular attempts to exert control by buying agreement
‘to its recommendations on the part of obstinate members of
the tribe by giving horses and presents of various kinds to
persuade people to behave as the council recommends.

Since they didn't have an; p ear of taxation there, their
only ready cash can from annuities. It was pretty diffi—_‘

cult for them to do this. .:u 3?3-37u)

IMajor'harston wrote that all of the‘Indian nations, including the
ox, which he had mentioned in his report:

* * * * are governed almost altogether by the advice of
their chiefs and the fear of punishment from the evil
spirit not only in this, but in the other world. The only
instances wherein I have ever knoun any laws enforced or
penalties exacted for a disobedience of them by the Sacks
auui ?oxes, are when they er returning in th spring from

their hunting grounds to th ir village.

constantly in the period after 1820 as representative, spokeman and
ambassador of the Chiefs’ Council of the Sac Tribe and frequently for

the Fox Tribe as well. In the troublesome times of 1828 to 1832, he was

charged by the Chiefs’ Councils to carry out his Nation's policy to

avoid any conflict with the whites and of complying with the demands of

the United States to move all members of the Sac and Fox Kation west

of the Mississippi River. After the Black Eawk episode, he was made

a principal chief of the Sacs at the direction of the United States at

the council held in connection with the Treaty of 1832.

Black Hawk hlso a well-known Sac Indian who lived during this

Period. He was a an important brave. In his youth he achieved some success and considerable renown as a warrior. He became one of the leaders

Of the group of Sac and Fox Indians who were determined to remain east

of the Mississippi River. Throughout his career he frequently was at

odds with the constituted authorities of the Sac and Fox Hation.

56. The decision of the Chiefs‘ Councils of the Sac and Fox §ation

to yield the lands east of the Mississippi River to the United States was

an unpopular one and many members of the Sac and Fox Nation refused to

leave.

'0

ence of Sac and Fox Indians east of the hississippi River might lead to
trouble with the white squatters and would have serious repercussions in
the Ration's relations with the United States. Keokuck was directed, as
the §ation's representative; to remain at Saukenuk during 1829 and to
keep peace among the Indians there and the white persons, and to persuade
if Possible, these Indians to move west of the Mississippi. Keokuck's

post was described by Sac and Fox Agent Forsyth as follows:

FUUI

The Chiefs‘ Councils were greatly concerned that the continued presC)

* his intention was to go down to the Iho'ai River to reside
but that the head chiefs who are now at Ihowai River directed him
to remain at Rocky River to keep things in order if possible. and
that he must obey the chiefs, otherwise him and those of his family
now here would have been at their new village at Ihowai River long
since. That he had succeeded in preventing two partizans who have
been fasting since last winter, from going to war. * * * * indeed
he sees the necessity that the Indians should abandon their old
village at Rocky River and live on their own lands.

Keokuck and other representatives of the Sac and Fox Nation continued
their efforts during the next two years to persuade and influence Black
Hawk's party to stay west of the Mississippi River.

57. After 1828, the Sac and Fox Indians who remained east of the
iississippi River did so contrary to the authority of their chiefs. These
Indians were referred to as the "mutinous group" or band and later as Black
Hawh‘s party or band. General Clark described this group in l83l as being
composed of: ‘

* * * * parts of two Bands headed by two inconsiderable

chiefs, who after abandoning their old village have, it

appears returned again, in defiance of all consequences.

58. The mutinous group of Sac and Fox Indians continued to return east

River

of the Mississippi/in the years 1829, 1830 and l83l. These Indians asserted
their right to occupy lands east of the hississippi River on the old ground
that the Treaty of l804 was invalid. Black Hawk in his Autobiography stated
that he had been told by great chiefs of both the United States and the British
that if the Sac and Fox Nation had never sold its land "our Great Father would
not take it from us." This group of Indians also maintained that, under the

terms of the Treaty of l80&, they were entitled to live and hunt on the lands

east of the Kississippi River which were the property of the United States.

Illinois Hilitia upon learning of the return of the Sac and Fox Indians

in 1831 and advised General Clark:

In the latter part of June, the Illinois Militia advanced on the Sat

and Fox villages located on Rock River.
_1§ri_§.an_<=_.__e _a._n_<L_.C.9_==:I.n_e..I2.§_
Governor Reynolds‘ statement is contained in a letter dated May 26,
l83l, to General Clark. Governor Reynolds’ motives, like his predecessor

Governor Edwards, were strongly political.

He was told, however, by General Clark to take no action and that

ithe removal of Black Hawk’s party rested with General Gaines. On that day,

Governor Reynolds wrote to General Gaines stating that he had called out

the Militia to repel what he termed an "invansion" of the State of Illinois.
The following day, General Gaines wrote to Governor Reynolds to the effect

‘u.

that he did not "deem it necessary or proper to require militia under

elisting circumstances.

Talks were conducted on June 4, 5, and 7 by General Gaines with representatives of the Sac and Fox hation. On the second day of these talks,
General Gaines wrote to Governor Reynolds requesting a battalion of mounted

mall.

the part of the Indians as "The Chiefs and Braves of the Band of Sac Indians
usually called "the British Band of Rock River" with their old allies, the

Pottawattomy, Hinnebago and Kickapoo nations. The second paragraph of

said instrument provides:

6é. The Sioux and Menominee Indians in the Spring of 1832 prepared to take revenge against the Sac and Fox Nation for an attack of Sac
and Fox on Menominee in summer of 1831. There were also reports that
Black Hawk’s party intended to return'to Illinois in the spring. On April 8,
1832, General Atkinson left St. Louis with United States troops for Fort

Spring Campaign against the Sat and Fox. The Menominee had also assembled

Potawatomies and even to the upper Sioux; the neutrality of even the

Winnehagoes was uncertain (Letter, Jan. ll; l832). He also said:

These measures strongly indicate an extensive combination, which is gaining ground from an impression that

the government will not interfere.
The Sac and Fox Nation solicited aid from the Missouri tribes to oppose
the Sioux and Menominee Indians and their allies (Letter, February 23,
1832, General Clark to Commissioner of Indian Affairs Herring).

General Atkinson left for Rock Island on the morning of April 8,
1333 (Letter, April 7, 1832, to General Gaines). —General Clark predicted
that General Atkinson would obtain a "voluntary" surrender of the princiPal men enoaged in the Menominee killings although he also acknowledged
that the chiefs of the Sat and Fox Ration:

have * * * * cannot (as they/Etated) undertake a matter or the

kind--they have not the power. (Letter, April 8, 1832,

to Commissioner of Indian Affairs Herring)

Black Hawk's party had for some time previous been making preparations to return east of the Mississippi River (Black Hawk's Autobiography,
pp. 27-28) and according to Colonel Taylor these plans must have been known
to~GeneralAtkinson and to the Commanding General in Washington for several

months(Letter, December 4, 1832, to Major General Jesup). General Atkinson,

at Black Hawk and his party would return to their old
villages on the Rock River although, in his opinion, Black Hawk did not
intend to do so. (Letter, April 8, l832} However, while proceeding up
the Mississippi River, General Atkinson heard at the lower rapids (presumably the Rapids Des Moines) that Black Hawk and his band had crossed the
Mississippi River on April 5 (Minutes of Council, April 13, 1832).

63. The party known as Black Hawk's party crossed the Mississippi
River on April 5, 1832 at a place generally described as Yellow Banks,
nearly opposite the mouth of the Iowa River. A Sac chief, Napope, and

at

the Sec brav , Black Hawk, were the leaders of the party. Two faxes and

\

all of the Sec Indians involved in the Menominee killings_were with the
Part“. The party included a number of women, children and old people and
probably less than 500 men, of whom 100 were Kickapoos and the balance
mostly Secs with some Foxes. Members of the party carried with them
baggage, heavy equipment such as mats for building lodges, and a number

of peltries for trading.

Evidence and Comment

 

§

The bluffs described as Yellow Banks extend along the Mississippi

River for some distance. Mrs. Ellen C. Whitney, an expert witness testifying for the Sac and Fox petitioners, located the place of crossing as being
nearly opposite the mouth of the lows River in present Mercer County,
Illinois. (Tr. l85) The date and place of crossing is stated by General
nis letter of April 13, 1832 to Governor Reynolds.

Xapope was regarded by Black Hawk as his chier and the head of the

Black Hawk was the head warrior and older than us
and led us (Minutes of Examination of Indian Prisoners,
August 20, l832).
Napope was probably the onlv principal or hereditary chief of the Sat
and Fox Nation with Black Hawk (Testimony of Dr. Wallace, Tr. 424).
While other lndians in Black Hawk's party were sometimes referred to
as chiefs, this resulted, in Dr. Wallace's opinion, from:
* * * * their own private organization, probably their
own private band leaders who would be called chiefs
when they were speaking about themselves (Tr. 493).
The acquisition of new political status by persons in Black Hawk’s party
is emphasized by the message brought from the party to General Atkinson
by We-com—me, a Sac chief, that Napope was "now" the principal chief (An wer
from Black Hawk, April 26, 1832). ~
The Sac Chief Wa—com—me informed General Atkinson that two of the
principal Foxes and all of the Sacs concerned in the Menominee killings
. , gawk.
were with hapope (Answer from Black, .pr1l 26, 1832).

Black Hawk said the party carried:

* * * * such provisions as we had, camping equipage,
* * * * (Black Hawk's Autobiography).

The party's equipment is also described by Colonel Taylor in a report to
Major General Jesup (Letter, December é, l832). Peltries were found in the
camp of Black Hawk's party following the skirmish known as Stillman's Run
(letter, May l8, l832, Samuel Whiteside to General Atkinson).

Ellen C. Whitney appeared as an expert witness in regard to the socalled Black.Hawk War. Mrs. Whitney is probably the outstanding authority

her emplyment by the Illinois State Historical Library, she worked as a

‘researcher and as a reporter for International News Service.

Whitney testified that she had been employed by the Illinois
State Historical Library since December, l9&6, and in March l948 commenced work on the Library's Black Hawk War collection, on which she has

worked continously since that time with the exception of one year (Tr.56,

52) that the collection originally consisting of approximately 1,000

original documents, and today numbers about 2,000 documents as a result
of a comprehensive search for additional material in the Archives, the
Library of Congress in Washington, and among the many State historical
associations (Tr.Sb-57,59-60). rrs. Whitney's work included identifying

writing biographical notes about

\

the persons mentioned in manuscripts,
the persons involved in the Black Hawk incident, obtaining additional manuscripts whenever her research indicated their existence, making a comprehensive search of the secondary sources which, she said, involved examining
from 900 to 1,000 books, and evaluating the materials which she examined
(Tr.57-59,143-144); that the purpose of her work has been to prepare for
pulication, as one of the Library's historical collections, its documents

on the Black Hawk disturbance an to evaluate the materials to be published

6 Black Hawk's party probably desired peacefully to return east of
the Mississippi River. The party had been invited to return east of the
nississippi River and plant corn at the village some éO.miles up the Rock
River of the Winnebago half—breed known as the Winnebago Prophet. Black

Hawk stated that the Prophet had told him:

That Black Hawk's part‘ was not a war party, and had no intention of

being the aggressor against the United States is the opinion of Dr.

interpreted Black Hawk's crossing the Mississippi

* * * * without the intention of attacking but with the
feeling that he is in the right and that, if attacked,
he will defend himself.(Tr.427)

Dr. Wallace further expressed the opinion that in "no sense was this a

war party at all" and reiterated it was "a community on the move" as

H

from "winter encampment to summer village ; and further that the Black

Hawk 3PiS0de "does not at all” conform to the usual pattern of Indian warfare (Tr.é39,¢é0-£1). ~

Evidence and Comment

 

The Winnebago Prophet at a conference held with Major Bliss stated‘

that he had invited the members of Black Hawk's party to stay at his village (Council, April 6, 1832). The invitation received from the Prophet

is repeated by Black Hawk at a council with the Sac messengers, April 26,

l

Cl)
D)
l\.)

, and in his Autobiography and by Napope (Examination of Prisoners,

. The offer of the Ninnebago Prophet was particularly
attractive because Black Hawk's party had been prevented from harvesting the
corn planted in the summer of l83l east of the hississippi River and no new

fields had been cleared in which corn could be raised (Black Hawk's AutoQ

biography).

General Atkinson’s analysis of the situation at this time ‘as that

4s party would not Commit the first hostile act but would resi U’:

upril 26, l832). Black Hawk took the position that he had been invited to
the Prophet's village to grow corn, and that he would not make the first
attack but would defend himself if attacked (Black Hawk’s Autobiography}.

Both Dr. Wallace (Tr. 423-25) and Mrs. Whitney (Tr. l72-73) regarded
the visions and dreams of the Whinnebago Prophet (who was engaged in a kind
of religious revival) as an influential factor in Black Hawk's decision to
return to Illinois. The Prophet predicted that Black Hawk might return
and remain unmolested. Black Hawk's reliance on the Prophet's promises
is asserted in his Autobiography but his confidence in the Prophet was not
shared by most members of the Sac and Fox Nation (Black Hawk's autobiography).

hrs. Whitney believed that, while Black Hawk felt that he had a grievance,

* * * * didn't have any well—defined plans. He
started out. (Tr. 176-77)

67. The Sac and Fox Nation was opposed to and disapproved of the
action taken by Black Hawk's party in crossing the Mississippi River, and
used all of its influence and did everything within its power short of
military to prevent Black Hawk's party from doing so. The Nation believed
the Winnebago Prophet to be largely responsible for the Party's action.
when Black Hawk sent messengers to Keokuck with information that the Prophet
and hapope had said that support would be receiged from the British and other
Indian tribes, his autobiography reports that:

They did not hear. Ke—o-hock said that I had been

imposed upon by liars, and had much better remain

Evidence and Comment

 

The quotation in the Finding is from Black Hawk’s Autobiography,
Black Hawk also stated that when Keokuck ascertained that Black Hawk
was determined to secure his village and:

* * * * fearing that some difficulty would arise, he
made application to the Agent (St. Vrain) and great
chief (General Clark) at St. Louis, for permission
for the chiefs of our nation to go to Washington to

ggualvp

see our Great Father, that we might have our difficulties
settled amicably.

and that Keokuck also requested, through the:

* * * * trader (Davenport), who was going on to Washington

to call on our Great Father and explain everything to him,
and ask permiscion for us to come on and see him.
Ehen permission was not forthcoming, Black Hawk determined to return east
of the nississipoi River and then attempted to recruit braves from Keohuck's

hand without success. He concluded:

Every overture was made by Ke—o—kuck to prevent
difficultv * * * *.

.. 3
The Chiefs‘ Councils of the Sec and for Nation did what they could to
prevent Black Hawk's party from returning to Illinois. One of their chiefs,
Apanose, ‘as sent to Black Hawk's camp on the west side of the Mississippi
River near the Des Moines Rapids for the purpose of persuading them not to

cross the Mississippi River and of advising of the probable consequence to them

0 3 '

is they did. he also tried to convince in ividual members to come away but

Apenose said he was "a little too late tor the Winnehage Prophet's message

4had been received beror

e he got there (Minutes of Council, April l3, 1832).

Keokuck too regarded the ?rophet as the "One who has raised all th's A "

e for chief, Tainah, also used his best efforts to restrain Black
£awk's party and to ascertain its designs when the party visited his
village at Flint Hills on the west side of the Mississippi River on their
way to Rock River(Letter, July 22, l832, to the President). Taimah also

said that the minds of Black Hawk's party "were greatly corrupted with

various foreign fables." The good faith of Taimah was attested by General

Clark’s sug-agent Ruland (Letter, August 24, 1832, to Commissioner Herring).

The Sac and Fox Nation also obtained credits from its trader Davenport

in order to purchase ‘

* * * *provisions, ammunitions, clothing, and other necessaries, which were found requisite to restrain some of our
young men from joininc Black Hawk's party, as well as to
support our families. (Speech of Keokuck,fJune l, 1833;
see also Minutes of Council, September 19, 1832).

Dr. Wallace, after reviewing a series of examples of these efforts by

the Sat and Fox Nation to prevent Black Hawk's party from crossing the

Mississippi River, stated:

I can't think of anything which the Sac and Fox Council
or Nation could have done which they didn't do, first of

all to prevent Black Hawk from going back across the
Mississippi River * * *.(Tr. 443)

well as to the Red—men, a bloody war has been waged,
during the past summer, b_ the Black-Hawk, and his followers
against the citizens, and upon the Territory, of the United
States. Black Hawk and his band, contrary to his duties to
his own nation, and in violation of Solemn Treaties entered
into with the United States, crossed from the West to the
East of the Great River, in front of us. He was twice summoned by the Great War Chief (Genl. Atkinson) to return to
the West side, and respect the treaties his nation had antered into with the United States. He refused to return;

He was deaf to the language addressed to him. Having recruited his followers, and united himself with the Prophet's
band, he ascended the Rock River, and after passing Dixon's
Ferry, and Turtle River, he commenced an indiscriminate
attack on all the whites he encountered. He raised the
tomahawk against the United States, murdered their defenceless citizens, and massacred the helpless women and
children whom he met, without mercy.

At this point of time, your Great Father, not knowing
precisely how many warriors were engaged with Black Hawk,

or how many misguided men of other nations might join.his‘
standard, sent me from the Great Lake, on the other side‘

of the mountains, to see whether any other tribes were
engaged in these wanton hostilities. Your Great Father the
President never doubted but General Atkinson would be able
to destroy Black Hawk and his Band; but not knowing whether,
other bands might not join him, the President sent me to

look into the matter, and here I am in the midst of my
troops, who surround you.

 

with the Black Hawk, I had brought a force sufficient to
sweep the Sacs and Foxes, as well as the Winnebagoes from
the face of the Earth. It is because we found the Principal chiefs of the confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes
faithful to the treaties they had entered into with the
United States, and that they have not diped their hands

We are aware that our f iends the Chiefs resent exert

It is repeated that this is the strict, acknowledged law of
nations; It is also strict justice — and, if we do not now
enter into your country, and mark off the part of your lan'
forfeited, it is because we respect the chiefs present, regard them as friends, and do not wish to act harshly with
them. We state to you at the beginning the strict law of
justice, and state what we have a right to exact. Put a
great people like the United States, who feel power, feel
also disposed to treat the weaker party with moderation,
and temper justice with humanity. The United States, a
great nation, must punish their enemies. The Black Hawk
has been signally chastized. But the U. States must go
further, as an example to others, and hence the demands
which the commissioners will presently make of you.

at the council meeting on April 13, l832 the chiefs expressed
opposition to activities of Black Hawk and his party and their desire to

do everything they could in opposing. At this council meeting General

Atkinson of the United States Army stated with reference to the conduct

of Black Hawk and his party: "I care nothing for it, they can he as easily

crushed as a piece of dirt."

Keokuck first spoke on behalf of t niefs and.replied to General

Atkinson as follows:

what you say, last fall we had a meeting on invitation of
Major Bliss and our agent, as soon as the Council was over

never could get them to speak with us since. If the War
Party had started from our village, we would feel ourselves

trouble is a winnehago called the Prophet.

Kapello, a Eon chief, promised to visit Morgan's village where certain

of the Fox lndians involved in the Menominee killings lived and attempted
to bring about their voluntary surrender.

In letter of April 8, l832, Genertl William Clark in regard to
surrender of those involved in the Menominee killings says:

I think it is not improbable that a voluntary surrender will be made of the principal men engaged in

the Menomonie massacre; but the chiefs of the Nation
cannot (as they have stated) undertake a matter of
Ehg_kind-—they have not the power. (Letter, April 8,
1832, to Commissioner Herring) (Underscoring supplied)

68. Black Hawk and his party had moved openly up the Mississippi
River by land and by canoe. The Sac and Fox representatives informed
General Atkinson that the party had encamped a few miles south of Rock
River on April l2 and, on the next day, were within six to eight‘miles
of the place where their council with General Atkinson was being held.
Black Hawk's party made no attempt to occupy its old village but proceeded up the east side of Rock River towards the Winnebago Prophet's
village. General Atkinson reported on April 13 to his Commanding Officer,
General Macomb, that he had decided not to pursue Black Hawk's party because his force was too small and that dnaparty had as yet committed no
act of hostility. He also wrote to Governor Reynolds to the same effect.

69. The Sac and Fox Nation sent two of its representatives from

Rock Island on April 15 for the purpose of persuading members of Black

Hawk's party to return west of the Mississippi River. They found Black

Hawk's party about 18 miles up the Rock River moving in the direction of

the Prophet's village. The Nation's representatives returned to Rock

Island on April 16 and reported that they had been badly received by

Black Hawk's party.

At the council held with General Atkinson on April l3, l832, Keokuck

The quotation is from a letter dated April l9, l832.
St.Vrain in his journal records the return of General Atkinson to
Rock Island on April 18 and the arrival there on the same day of Wapello
and Morgan's bands. At the council held on April 19 Wapello tendered to
General Atkinson the three Fox Indians, all of whom were members of important Fox families, as:

The balance of the persons involved in the Menominee killings were

with Black Hawk's party (Letters April 19, 1832, General Atkinson

to General Macomb).

71; On April l7, 1832, Black Hawk and his party reached the Winnebago

Prophet's village which is approximately 40 miles from the mouth of Rock

River. At the request of General Atkinson, two Sac chiefs were sent to

Black Hawk and his party with instructions from General Atkinson which,
part, are as follows:

I advise you to come back and recross the Mississippi

The talk from which the quotation in the Finding is taken is dated April 24,
l832. The two Sac Indians were Reatchony and We-com-me, both of whom General

Scott and Governor Reynolds identified as Sac chiefs (Letter, September 22,

l832 to General Clark).

72. The two Sac chiefs reached the Prophet's Village on April 25th
and returned to Rock Island on April 26th. The Sac chiefs delivered the
following answer from Napope, who_was identified as "now the principal chief”
of Black Hawk’s party:
We have no bad feelings, why do they send to us to tell
us to go back——we will not look back, we will go on. I

Black Hawk and other braves, members of the party, made statements to similar
effect.

73. The Illinois Militia was called out by Governor Reynolds of Illinois.

We advised General Atkinson on April 22, l832 that he would have 1,500 men
ready to march on the Indians on April 25 or 26. Governor Reynolds appears
to have regarded his political career in jeopardy by reason of Black Hawk's
party’s presence in the State of Illinois for he said:

Nothing will save me; but a decisive stroke on the

Indians. I have so written to the War Dept. of the

U.S. and so I write you.

Governor Reynolds of Illinois in his History o Illinois says:

first at Old Fort Madison, on the Mississippi, and marched
up the river by land and water to the Yellow Banks, where
Oquawka stands at this day, on the 6th of April, 1832. They
amounted to about five hundred warriors--women, children,
and dogs in proportion—-and had with them all their horses,
baggage, and wealth.

But the danger of the frontiers was so pressing that
decided, on the 16th of April, to call out a large number
of volunteers. I did this on my own responsibility, as I
had not then received any requisition from General Atkinson,
who commanded the regular forces at Rock Islan'.

General Henry Atkinson in a letter to Governor Reynolds, dated April l3,

l832 advises the Governor that a Band of Secs under Black Hawk joined by

about 100 Kickapoos, and a few Pottawattimies amounting in all to about

500 men has assumed a hostile attitude and crossed the Mississippi at the

Yellow Banks on the 5th of April and were moving up on the east side by

Rock River toward the Prophet's Village. He further states that this band

had not yet committed any act of hostility and that they profess not to

intend to strike the first blow but to resist any attempt to remove them

!i---again from the Rock River country. He says: l think the frontier is in

the Indians in two or three days when he will again write the Governor.

On April l8tn General Atkinson in a letter to Major General Edmund

P. Gaines said that the Sacs and their associates had passed up on the

east side of Rock River and were on their we’ to the Pro het’s Village.

He says:

They as yet committed no act of hostility, but their whole
conduct indicates a determination to resist any attempt that
may be made to drive them back to the West of the Mississippi—and it is thought by some persons here whose opinions, and
acquaintance with the Indians should have weight, that they
rill strike as soon as they secure their women & children in
the swamps, I am rather of the opinion however, that they will
no

,'until an attempt is made to coerce then; still the probabilis are against this opinion. Within three or four days I shall
obtain positive information as to their location and probably
their intentions. I have persons employed, on whom I can depend
to visit the country and collect information, all of which shall
be promptly communicated.

If the unfriendly Indians and their associates remain quiet,

or more properly speaking do not commence further hostility

than the mere act of invading the Country, I presume you will
wait till advices are received from the Government before you
take, or order measures for their removal. Should this possible case of quiet take place, I-shall in the course of a week
or ten days return to St. Louis, to more readily correspond with
you and receive your instructions.

On April 24, 1832 General Atkinson wrote direct to Black Hawk and

Chiefs and Braves of his Band, as follows:

I am sorry to learn that you have taken your Band across
the Mississippi and carried them up on Rock River contrary
to the treaty you made last year with General Gaines &
Governor Reynolds. Your great father will be angry with
you for doing so. I advise you to come back and recross

too late that it is not true.

Ir your hearts are good I will send an officer to talk with
you in three or four days.

Indian agent Felix St. Vrain in his Journal covering April l5th to
May 9, l832 reports that on April léth Messengers Lambusier and Apinoes,
who had been sent by General Atkinson to see the Black Hawk Band and
plead for them to go back West of the Mississippi, brought news that
this Band badly received such messengers and appeared. hosti e. St.
Vrain reports as of the 26th word was received from Black Hawk to the
effect that they had no bad intention but that they would not return to
the West side of the Misssissippi. As of April 27th he reports that Mr.
Gratiot reported he had visited the Black Hawk Indians and stated that
they were hostile; that Black Hawk's "heart was badly inclined."

74. Governor Reynolds was advised in a letter dated May 5, l832,
from Secretary of War Cass that his hilitia should be placed under the
command of General Atkinson and that General Atkinson had been instructed:

* * * * to compel. these Indians to recross the Mississippi
River. He will merely give notice to them, that if they do
not immediately retire, they will be attacked, and he will
follow this notice by offensive measures, and not desist

till the object be attained. and should they recross the
river & continue embodied, evin ing a hostile disposition he
will follow them, and subdue and disperse them. And he will‘
also continue his operations till such a number of the murderers of the Menominees are surrendered as will answer the

purpose of justice, and serve as a proper example to the
Indians. I

Secretary of Mar Cass commented that:

Early in May, Black Hawk and his party had probably determined

to return peacefully west of the Mississippi River. The party had discovered that they could not remain at the Winnebago Prophet's village and
that no assistance would be given them by either the winnebagoes or the
Potawatomies. On May 4 Agent St. Vrain received the report that members

of Black Hawk's party were returing west of the Mississippi River. General

Clark in a letter dated May 5, 1832 advised the Secretary of War that Black
Hawk and his party:

* * * * being disappointed in the Winnebagoes & Puttowatemmies,
and being alarmed at the movements of the military and‘mounted
Militia, are descending Rock River with the evident intention
of recrossing the Mississippi.

In letter dated May 12, l832, Agent Owen informed Governor Reynolds:

* * * * that the Sacs are-on Rock River about 30 miles
above Ogee's ferry, in a state of starvation and are
anxious to recrcss the Mississippi but dare not descend
Rock River for fear of being interdepted by the Militia

& indiscriminately slaughtered without affording them

an opportunity of explaining the cause of their recent
movements. They aver most positively to the Potawatimies
that they had no design of committing any wrong whatever towards the people of their great Father.

Evidence and Comment

 

The Winnebago Prophet had been ordered by Major Bliss on April 6, 1832,
to rescind his invitation to Black Hawk's party to plant corn at his village
(Conversation, April 6, l832). When advised by the Winnebagoes that his

party could not remain at the Prophet s village and further that no assistance

realized that he had been deceivedamM.that the promises made to Napope were false
‘ Hawa s Autobiography). Black Hawk and his party then sought permission of
the Pota*atomies to make a village and plant corn on their lands but without success.
apparently some members of the party were willing to return west of the Mississippi on April 25 (Report of Wa-com—me, April 26, 1832). At that time the party
had but little corn. Black Hawk's later attempts to obtain some from the Potawatomie
were unsuccessful (Black Hawk's Autobiography).
Agent St. Vrain recorded in his journal for May 4:
Poy-ne-ha-ne-sa said that the Sec Indians of Rock River were
returning to the west side of the Mississippi, that they had
been disappointed about the assistance expected from the Winnebagoes, and others, that he had left them all at Profets Village three days ago.
Blacl Hawk in his Autobiography said he concluded that:

I think the whole general tenor of secondary sources and

primary sources available to me leads me to believe this

is a safe and sound conclusion * * * * (Ir. 3&9
namely, that prior to Stillman's Run, the first engagement of the Episode, Black
Hawk's party contemplated no hostile action and desired to return west of the
nississippi River (Tr. 3&4-49).

The testimony of Dr. Wallace was to the same effect (Tr. £27-428).

76. Prior to the first engagement of the episode, known as Stillman's Run
on May ls, l832, Black Hawk's party had committed no hostile acts or depredations
and had determined to return west of the Mississippi River.

On May 12, 1832, several companies of Illinois Militia under the command
Major Stillman were directed to proceed from Dixon's Ferry against some of

Black Hawk's party reported to be at or near a place known as Old Man's Creek,

which was subsequently renamed Stillman’s Run.

Black Hawk was then en amped a few miles to the north with a party
of some £0 or SO warriors, the main part of his Dartv being some distance
awak. On the evening of May li he was engaged in givin east to certain Potawatomie chiefs who were visiting him. He learned of the presence

or the Militia force and dispatched a peace mission to arrange a conference

concerning the terms of surrender so that he might return across the Mississippi
River. This party consisted of three men under a flag of truce. They were
excorted a distance by another party for the purpose of ascertaining how

the peace party was received.

The first shots of the skirmish were fired by the Militia who noticed

balance fled with the hilitia in pursuit. The escort reached Black Hawk's

camp and he came to their assistance. The attacking Militia thereupon fled,

abandoned their camp and many deserted.

The three messengers from Black Hawk's party who reached the Militia
camp under a flag of truce had in the meantime been seized by the Militia.
One was killed and the remaining two were able to effect their escape.

Evidence and Commentl

Defendant contends that the contention that Black Hawk Band were desirous
of recrossing the Mississippi was due to mis—information or in any event that
such reports were not in good faith because "no confidence can be placed in
what he (Black Hawk) may promise.” After the fighting and bloodshed of the
Stillman's Run incident on May léth, the Government took the position that no"

further peaceful negotiations were possible. Although the Government contends that Black Hawk and his allies after May léth "proceeded to lay waste

Mrs. Whitney testified that no depradations were reported and that

no hostile acts had been committed by Black Hawk's party prior to Stillman's

Run and further that the settlers generally regarded the members of Black

‘J

Hawk's party to be friendly (Tr. 83- ., 168-69). One editior collected various contemporary observations concerning Black Hawk's party (History of

Peoria County, Illinois). Thus, John Dixon, whose home was at Dixon's

Perry, said that the braves "were orderly and gave no signs of hostile

intentions." Another settler in the lead mining area was paid by the party

for corn taken from him, and Captain Green said t he had never heard of

whatever, not even petty theft. The author concludes that it is a wellknown fact that no Indian warriors ever went on the war path encumbered with

women and children, and that, more than this:

* * * * it does not appear from the sixth day of April
until Stillman's soldiers disregarded his flag of truce
on the l2th of May, that a single settler was murdered
or suffered any material injury at the hands of Black
Hawk or his band.

inding as to Stillman's Run is based largely upon Mrs. Whitney's
testimony (Tr. 86-98; 290-295), Dr. Wallace's testimony (Tr. 428), the

report of Governor Reynolds in his Memoirs, the report of Black Hawk in his

noted historian and editor of the editi .Autobiography in

evidence, stated:

The conflict here described, known as the battle of Stillman's
Bun or Stillman's Defeat, occurred May lé, 1832, a few miles
southwest of the Mouth of Sycamore Creek, in Ogle County,
Illinois. Black Hawk's description of the disgraceful affair
is substantially correct.

as Mrs. Whiteny pointed out in the course of her testimony, the fact
that the Militia attacked the Indians, as narrated by Black Hawk, is corroborated by Napope, Governor Reynolds and Col. Taylor (Tr. 89-90), and
General Atkinson himself deplored Stillman's action. No official report
appears to have been made by Stillman, whose account was subsequently published in the newspapers. Mrs. Whitney, whose studies have included a

F

carerul and searching analysis of the reliability of the accounts of this

incident, evaluated Stillman's statement to be:

* * * * primarily (in the nature of) a publicity tatement to
o’-3

s
counteract the widespread criticism he had r ceived for having
brought on the battle. (Tr. 91) '

Dr. Wallace unqualifiedly accepts the flag of truce displayed at
Stillman's Run as a genuine attempt on the part of Black Hawk's party to

surrender (Tr. 440).

There is a general unanimity among contemporary authorities that the

responsibility for Stillman's Run rested wholly with the United States. Thus,

the Militia are described in one account as being:

* * * * in a kind of frolic——under Col. S; they came upon
a few quiet and inoffensive Indians, and murdered several
of them in cold blood; (Cooke, Scenes and Adventures in
the Arm’; or Romance of Military Life)

In yet another account, it is stated:
They also deny that there was any violation of the flag
of truce, but in this evidence seems to be overwhelming.
(The History of Peoria County)

77. By a letter dated Aav 22, l832, President Jackson directed that
the surrender of Black Hawk, with other members of his partv, as hostages
be
for the future good conduct of their party oenanded. Operations were directed

by the United States to be continued against Black Hawk's party until his

party submitted unconditionally to this demand and was made an example to

other Indians. General Clark, who found the instructions for dealing

' recommended to Secretary

with Black Hawk's party to be "highly gratifying,’
of War Cass that a:

* * * *War of extermination should be waged against
them. The honor & respectibility of the Government

requires this.
Evidence and Comment
President Jackson's direction referred to in the tindings was communicated
on his behalf by Major General Macomb to General atkinson (Letter, May 22,
il832). He later directed that Black Hawk's party must be chastised as a
deterrent to other Indian tribes (Letter, June 12, 1832, Acting Secretary
of War Robb to General Atkinson). The displeasure of the President at
General Atkinson's failure to bring an early termination of the Black Hawk
episode is expressed in this letter.
Secretary of War Cass furnished General Clark with a copy of General
Macomb's Letter to General Atkinson’s (Letter, May 22, 1832).
ln a later letter, Secretary of War Cass informed General Clark that:
The United States will not suspend their operations till
Black Hawk, and his party are reduced to unconditional submission, and such a lesson taught them as will secure their
future good conduct, and will reach every tribe east of the

Rocky Mountains.(Letter June 27, 1832)

General Dodge, in calling for volunteers predicted:

‘A-'I::’:

* it will surely be the policy of the government to
then receive that kind of chastisement which will quiet the
effectually, and make a lasting example for others. l
Volunteers, June, l832)

78. although the desire of Black Hawk and his party to surrender

was generally known, General Atkinson and other representatives of the
United States did not communicate the terms of surrender to Black Hawk's

party as directed by President Jackson and Secretary of War Cass. Instead

they took steps to prevent Black Hawk's party from reaching the west side
of the Mississippi River and to provide, if possible, for its destruction.
In a letter dated July 24, l832, General Dodge assured General Atkinson

that:

* * * * every possible exertion will be made to destroy

the enemy crippled as they must be with their wounded ,

and families as well as their want of provision supplies.

others in Washington been so informed (Letter, May 22, 1832, Major General

Black Hawk and his party had expressly sought truce.

"The President's order that Black Pcwk be demanded of his associates,

with other hostiges" is containec.in a letter dated May 22, 1832, Major

General Macomb to General Atkinson. The terms upon which a truce would be

‘ t n
Ha ..

their only chance of preservation is to remain
et; and that course I trust they will take. (Letter

But there is no evidence that General Clark, General Atkinson or any
other representative of the United States communciated the terms of sur—
render to Black Hawk's party at any time prior to its final annihilation
(Testimony of Mrs. Whitney, Tr. 167-68). As the quotation in the finding
indicates, the destruction of Black Hawk's party was first desired.

Troops were stationed along the Mississippi River between the Rock
and wisconsin Rivers, and other troops pursued Black Hawk's party up the Rock
River to "kill them all” (Letter, June 4, 1832, Agent Street to General Dodge).
“$3 Parties Of 8iOuX, Menominee and_Winnebagoes and other Indians were sent
out by the United States from the north to complete the party's encirclement.
Not until Black Hawk's party had been dispersed and largely destroyed were
any terms of surrender sent to it.

79. After Stillman's Run,

lack Hawk's party moved northward in a continued attenpt to find a safe route to the west side of the Mississippi River.
General Atkinson, who was informed of these movements, stationed troops along
the Mississippi River and sent other troops in pursuit of Black Hawk's party.
In seeking to reach the Mississippi River near the northern boundary of the
present State of Illinois, warriors from Black Hawk's party were involved in

Atkinson was infomed by Potawatomie Agent Owen that the

* 8 * * they were then drying their meat and preparing to

cross the Mississippi immediately & would go unless prevented by the whites, and it is the decided opinion of Big

Foot, that they will act in accordance with this promise.

General Atkinson dispatched a company to Colonel Taylor with the advice

that Black Hawk's party intended to cross the Mississippi River and that:

* * * * should they attempt to pass down towards the

Mississippi and if practicable prevent them from effecting that object. (Letter, June 7, 1832)
The plan was to encircle and attack Black Hawk's party from all sides (Letter

Clark to Agent Hughes.)

General Atkinson later advise General Alexander on June 26, l83Z that
unofficial information had been received that Black Hawk's party was attempting to make "their way across the Mississippi by the route of Plum River"and‘
that General Alexander was directed to prevent Black Hawk's party from reaching the Mississippi River. A brigade of troops had been sent under General
Posey to Kellogg's for that purpose.

known as

“ lé, 1832, and the engagement on the Wisconsin Riverwisconsin Heights on July 21, 1832. Mrs. Whitney located Kellogg's Grove in

in the vicinity of Galena in the northwestern part of the State. (Tr.
19O'19l) She interpreted the fighting in this area as an attempt hv

Black awh to find an escape route. (Tr. 317-318)
Black Hawk and his party realized that it would be folly to proceed
against the volunteers and continued to retreat up the Rock River (Black
Hawk's Autobiography; testimony of Mrs. Whitney, Tr. 97, 99).
opinion of Mrs. Whitney, Black Hawk's party was just as eager to cross
the Mississippi after Stillman's Run as before (Tr. 350-351). Dr.
Wallace interpreted Black Hawk's movements after Stillman's Run as an

attempt to get back across the Mississippi River by a round-about route

through the Winnebago country.

‘\

Hrs. Whitney in her testimony analyzed at length all of the incidents

historically associated with the so-called Black Hawk War (Tr. 101-11;
1313139). It was her opinion that many of the frontier incidents in this
period did not involve Black Hawa's party as such and that for the most
part such incidents were independent and isolated encounters involving
individual Indians who usually were not members of Black Hawk's party.
From Mrs. Whitney's testimony it appears that 30 out of the 71 white persons killed in the Illinois—Wisconsin area during the summer of 1832 were
killed by Indians other than Black Hawk or the Sacs who accompanied him.
80. Finding that it could not cross the Mississippi River south of

Galena, Black Hawk’s party continued to move northward hoping to cross

to the west side by descending the Wisconsin River. By the time the party

arrived at the Wisconsin River it was in desperate need of food and supplies. On July 21, l832, Black Hawk's party was attacked while attempting

mo cross the Wisconsin River. In this engagement, known as Wisconsin Heights,

.there and several of his people died of hunger.

'51one white man was killed and Indian casuaicies numbered between 36 and 68.
Additional casualties were inflicted upon the members of Black Hawk's party
fleeing down the Wisconsin River in canoes by the Winnebago Indians sent
against them by the United States and United States troops and gunhoats
stationed at the mouth of and on the Wisconsin River.

Evidence and Comment

 

Black Hawk had established a temporary camp at a place called Four
Lakes in the country of the Winnebago. Food became extremely scarce

When the movement of the

Army against him resumed, he concluded to remove his women and children

across the Mississippi by descending the Wisconsin (Black Hawk's Authobiography).

Even prior to Stillman's Run, Black Hawk's party was suffering from lack.i

of food and was reported by some ovservers to be starving. General Street

reported that the prisoners taken on the Wisconsin River were:
* * * * the most miserable looking poor creatures you can
imagine. Wasted to mere skeletons, clothed in rags scarcely
sufficient to hide their nakedness, some of the children
look as iL they had starved so long they could not he restored. (Letter, August 1, 1832 to General Clark)

Black Hawk's party had vigorously defended against substantial odds
the advance of the Militia at Wisconsin Heights in order to permit the

women and children to cross the Wisconsin River. After this had been
accomplished, Black Hawk's party retreated overland to the Mississippi
River (Black Hawk's autobiography; Letter, August 1, l832, Agent Street to

General Dodge also assured General Atkinson that every possible enertion would be made to destroy the crippled enemy and that he would follow
them wherever they went (Letter, July 24, 1832). Two days later Captain

Loonis stationed two gun boats at the mouth of and on the Wisconsin River

Hawk's party who were descending the Wisconsin River in canoes were

fired upon by the gunboats and by the troops at Prairie du Chien. The

Winnebagoes also attacked them, even at night by torchlight. (Letter August

1, 1832, Agent Street to General Clark) with the result that only a few of
these lndians survived (Black Hawk's Autobiography). ‘

81. On the afternoon of August 1, 1832, Black Hawk, with members of
his party who had arrived at the Mississippi near the Bad Axe River,
again caused a flag of truce to be raised and sought to open negotiations

with the commander of the gunboat Warrior for the surrender of the party.
The Warrior violated the flag of truce and opened fire upon Black Hawk's
party.

Evidence and Comment

The trail.of the Indians from the iisconsin to the Mississippi was

described by Agent Street as:

* * *.indicative of their wretched situation--it was
evidently the trail of a routed & fleeing enemy. Dead,
wounded, and dieing men & children were left on the road.”

(Letter, August 3, 1832 to General Clark)

The commander of the Warrior assumed without investigation that tne
flag of truce was a decoy and callously reported that:

(Letter, August 3, 1832, Joseph Throckmorton)

Bet Black hawk had intended to surrender and in fact raised two white

T

flags (Black nawh’s Autobiography). His attempt to surrender is accepted
by hrs. Whitney as authentic and well corroborated (Tr. 134-136).

At the close of the episode, various members of Black Hawk's party
were taken prisoners by the United States and interrogated. One prisoner
said that he was standing near Black Hawk at the time he raised the white

flag and that Black shouted that:

I wish to come and shake hands with you-—waiving his
hands to correspond. hinutes of Examination of
Prisoners, August 19, 1832

Other prisoners similarly described Black Hawk's attempt to surrender

dinutes of Examination of Prisoners, August 20, 1832 and august 27,

82. On the following day, August 2, the final engagement, known as
Bad axe, took place. Ihe remnants of Black Hawk's party, including women
and children, were caught between the attacking forces under General
Atkinson and the Mississippi River. Agent Street described the engagement as follows:

The Ind. war is at an en‘. Yesterday Genl. Atkinson with
his main force overtook the hostile Inds. 36 miles above
Prairie du Chien on the East bank of the Mississippi, and
after a hard fought battle of 6 or 8 hours defeated, and

to Secretary of War Cass with the comment that the engagements at Bad era

and Wisconsin Heights had:

* * * * greatly reduced the number of the enemy, broken
his spirits, & probably terminated the active operations
or war. (Letter, August 10, l832)

to war against Black Hawk's party. These lndians were told that the Uni ed
States intended to encircle and kill all of Black Eawk’s-party. The
Kinnebagoes were advised, for example, that only by attacking Black Hawk's

party could they prove their friendship to the United States and avoid
being mistaken and killed as members of his party. The Winnebagoes were
also adbised that Black Hawk's party would seize their lands if they did
not prevent it from doing so. Guns and supplies were furnished the Indian
tribes by the United States to be used in their attacks on Black Hawk's party.
Evidence and Comments

Agent Street was directed to collect as many Menominees and Sioux
Indians as he could (Letter, May 26, 1832, General Atkinson to Captain
Locmis). He reported that he had uniformly said to the Indiana that their

walthough Agent Street told the Ninnebagoes that only by attack ng
Black Hawk's party could they prove their friendship and avoid being

killed by mistake, he encountered some reluctance among the Winnebagoes
which he overcame through gifts and presents. By June 6th he had assembled
an Indian force of between 160 and 200 warriors from the Sioux, Winnebago

and Menominee and had dispatched messengers to other villages of the Sioux

and Menominee (Letter, June 6, 1832, Agent Street to General Atkinson).

On the following day, guns were delivered to the 225 Indians then assembled
for the purpose of fighting the Sec and Fbx with the promise that they would
be the property of the Indians if they were well employed (Letter, June 7,
l832, Agent Street to General Clark).

A talk was sent to the Winnebago y General Atkinson in which he suggested that:

Street as having "behaved admirably" (Letter August 1, l832). The

activities of the Sioux are the subject of the succeeding finding.

the United States were at last being communicated to these Indians,

to continue their attacks on the scattered remnants of Black Hawn’s
party. On August 3, the morning following Bad Axe, a war party of 100
Sioux was sent out by General Scott on the trail of those members of
Black Hawk‘s party who had succeeded in crossing the Mississippi River.
The Sioux attacked and killed 100 or more of these Indians, including
children, women and old persons. Other casualties were inflicted upon
the members of Black Hawk’s party remaining east of the Mississippi
River by the Winnebago and Menominee. Upon receipt of these reports,_

General Scott advised Secretary of War Cass on August 26th that:

There is now, no doubt, that Black Hawk's hand

and proposed that the three voluntary prisoners confined in connection with

the killing of the Menominee be released for the reason that the Menominees

Evidence and Comments

 

The quotations in the finding are from a letter dated August 26, 1832.
Both General Atninson and General Scott were informed that the remnants of
Black Hawk's party west of the Mississippi River desired to surrender and
negotiate for peace through the Sec and Fox Nation (Letters, August 5, 1832,
General Atkinson to General Scott; to Aajor Peal; letters, August 10 and ll,
1832, General Scott to Secretary of War and Governor Reynolds). And of

course both had known of the desire of Black Ha*k's party to surrender

even prior to Stillnan's Run.

General Scott who was at Fort Armstrong also knew that General
Atkinson finally proposed to give the terms of surrender to Black Hawk's
party (Letter, August 16, 1832, General Scott to Secretary of War Cass).
He was first informed that the Sioux whom he had sent in pursuit of Black
Hawk's party (Letter, August 10, 1832, General Scott to Secretary of War
Cass) had killed or captured 100 of the party by representatives of the
Sac and Fox Nation who had been sent concurrently to communicate the
terms of peace (Letter, August 16, 1832, General Scott to Secretary of
War Cass). The initial report by the Sac and Fox did not satisfy General Scott and he ordered the Sac and Fox Nation to bring in the remnants
of the party within ten or tnelve days or he would fill its country with
troops.

On August 20, the Sac and Fox Ration brought in about 50 other persons
of Black Hawk's party, including boys, women and children, and General
Scott commenced to interrogate these prisoners. From this interrogation
he concluded, contrary to his earlier opinion that the Sioux did overtake the members of Black Hawk's party west of the Mississippi River and:

* * * * that nearly the whole of Black Hawk's band have
been killed, drowned or captured, or have been reported
as ready to be surrendered by the kindred but friendly
bands. (Letter, august l9, 1832, General Scott to Secretary of War Cass).

The Sioux Indians claimed that they had killed about 200 of the
Sac and fox Nation and taken 22 prisoners. While Agent Street regarded
this number as possibly exaggerated since only 68 scalps and 22 prisoners
had been delivered to him (Letter, august 22, 1832, to General Scott),
the Sioux were told that their Great Father "would be pleased at their

conduct.”

To arrive at the number of Sec and Fox Indians with Black Hawk s
P5?ty, Dr. Wallace deducted 100 Kickapoo men with families, or to be
conservative, about 300 persons altogether, which would leave about
900 persons who were Sac and Fox Indians with Black Hawh’s party
(Tr. 439—éO).

After Black Hawk's party had crossed the Mississippi River, there
were some accretions to it from the Winnebago Prophet's village, probably 100 warriors or 300 or 400 people, together with a few other
Winnebagoes and a very few Potawatomies (Testimony of Dr. Wallace, Tr.
4&0)- In the opinion of Dr. Wallace, the population of the Sac and Fox
Nation would at this time have been in the neighborhood of 6000 persons

* * * * that the power to dictate was very much in our
Own hands; but we did not believe that more disadvan,, 1'

tageous terms for the Sac a Fox Confederacy, would have
comported with the true glory of the U. States.
(Letter, September 22, 1832).
In the following year representatives of the United States in seeking
to overcome the opposition of the Potawatomies to the sale of certain

of their lands pointed to the failure of the Sac and For Nation voluntarily to sell its lands on the Mississippi as an object lesson for the

Potawatomies and states:

You are not ignorant. You know what calamities befel
the Soc's and Winnebagoe's during the last year. * * *
Does not the experience of the last year satisfy you
that it is too late to treat at the cannons mouth? Two
years ago, your Great Father wished to treat with the
Scc's and Foxes--but they refused to listen to his wise
councils. They opened their ears to the advice of the
wicked & desioning and after they were cut to pieces by,

his wcrriors, he treated them as he pleased. (Minutes or
Treaty Council, September Zl, 1833).

In the opinion of Dr. Wallace, the Sac and Fox would interpret the
demand made by the United States in accordance with their own customs
(Tr. 436—37). The Nation would, in his opinion, regard the Treaty as a
thine which was necessary for them to do at the time but as not constituting
by any means an admission of guilt or admission that the Nation had been
responsible for Black Hawk (Tr. 446-47). From the standpoint of the Chiefs’
Councils of the Sac and Fox Nation, it was very difficult to buy off an
injured party in another nation and that party or his relatives would be

entitled:

* * * * to measure the degree of retribution according
to his own likes. (Tr. 437)

The United States was appl*ing this same rule in Dr. Wallace's opinion,

when General Scott told the Sat and row representatives that the death

4 .
Ila.‘-11"

,or one American would not be satisfied by taking all of the Sac and
Fox country (Minutes of Treaty Council; Testimony of Dr. Wallace,

Tr. 437). The Sac and Fox Nation was also confronted with the necessity of obtaining additional annuities in order to cover the graves
of the persons with Black Hawk’s party who had been killed to prevent such persons from retaliating on the United States which, of
course, would mean further bloodshed (Tr. 437-38).

89. The Iowa and the Sac and Fox are found to have Indian title,
recognized by defendant, to the lands described in Finding No. 5, being
the lands described in and ceded by Article I of the Treaty of September
2l, 1832, 7 Stat. 374, less the part thereof reserved by Article II of
said treaty, as of the 9th day of February, 1833, the date on which
said traty was ratified. ' ‘

That the respective interests of the two tribes in said lands are
the following:

(1) The Sac and Fox had exclusive Indian title to the lands of
said cession (Royce l75) lying north of the line extending rom.the

point where the western boundary of said cession crosses the Red Cedar

River to a point on the Mississippi River five miles northeast of

Mnscatine, Iowa;

(2) The Iowa and the Sac and Fox jointly had Indian title to the
lands of said cession lyinc southerly of the line described in the next

preceding paragraph (1), and their interests therein were equal.
