including the several contracts of employment of attorneys by the plaintiffs
and assignments of interest in those contracts, the Commission makes the
following findings of fact:

1. The Award. On January 28, 1977, the Commission entered a final
award in this case awarding the sum of $1,023,808.65 to the Bois Forte
Band of Chippewa Indians. (39 Ind. C1. Com. 300, 325). Funds to satisfy
the judgment were made available pursuant to Public Law 95-240, approved

March 7, 1978.

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 164 155

2. The Petition. On December 23, 1977, Rodney J. Edwards, attorney

 

' fee

of record in this case, filed a petition for an award of attorneys
on behalf of himself and all other contract attorneys having an interest

in the fee in Docket 18-D. The petition requests the Commission to make

an award of attorneys‘ fee in the amount of $102,380.86, being ten percent
of the final judgmnt of $1,023,808.65, which was entered in this docket.

3. Attorneys‘ Contracts. Attorneys‘ services in this case were
initially performed under a contract of October 13, 1949, identified as
I-1—ind. 42241, between the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe and Austin L. Lathers,
Jay H. Hoag, and Clarence G. Lindquist, effective January 26, 1950, the
date of its approval by the Assistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs, U.S.
Department of the Interior. The contract was for a term of 10 years
at which time it became subject to a ten year extension, by approval of
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in the event the claims of the
Minnesota Chippewa Tribe had not then been finally disposed of.

At the expiration of the 1949 contract, a new contract, dated May 20,
1960, was entered into by the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe and attorneys
Clarence G. Lindquist, Jay H. Hoag, Edward L. Gruber, and Rodney J.
Edwards. ~The 1960 contract, identified as 14-20-0650, No. 854, was approved
by the Deputy Solicitor, United States Department of the Interior on
March 20, 1961, for a period of 10 years from the date of approval.
Contract No. 854 has been subject to several extensions, the most recent

being for a period of 1 year from March 20, 1977, by approval of the

Interior Department.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 164 166

The provisions for attorneys‘ fee in contract No. 854 are not
identical with those in its predecessor contract of October 13, 1949,

but the differences with respect to Indian Claims Commission work are not

significant. Contract No. 854 under which Docket 18-D was completed
provides in applicable part as follows:

In consideration of the services rendered and to be
rendered under the terms of this contract and prior contract
bearing symbol I-l-ind-42241, the parties of the second part
shall be entitled to receive and shall be paid such compensation as the Secretary of the Interior or his authorized
representative or if submitted to a Court, Tribunal or Commission, such Court, Tribunal or Comission may determine to
be reasonable and equitable compensation for the services
rendered herein, but in no event shall the aggregate fee
exceed ten per centum (10%) of the sum or sums recovered or
procured through their efforts in whole or in part for such
Indians, whether by such action or act of any department of
government or of Congress or otherwise.

Contract No. 854 limits the duties of the attorneys to advising,
representing, and prosecuting claims for the Minnesota Chippewa Indians

arising out of the Treaty of August 7, l866 (14 Stat. 765), which treaty

gave rise to the claim for compensation in Docket 18-D. The contract

contains the following provision on the assignment of interests in

I

attorneys fees:

It is hereby agreed by the parties of the second part
that this contract is subject to the terms and provisions
of the applicable assihiments of interest in the attorney
fees which have heretoiore been approved by the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs.

6. Notice to Parties. By letter dated December 28, 1977, the Clerk
of the Commission notified the appropriate parties including the tribal
representatives, the United States Department of Justice, and the United
States Department of the Interior of the filing of the subject petition
for attorneys’ fee in this docket. The Commission has received no reply
from the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe representatives.

On May 31, 1978, the Commission received a reply from the Department
of Justice wherein it is stated that the Department takes no position
with reference to the amount of attorneys‘ fee provided that the combined
fee to all counsel involved does not exceed 11) percent of the amount
recovered and that the Commission determines that the fees allowed are
reasonable for the services rendered. The Justice Department also
forwarded to the Commission with its reply a copy each of a letter dated
April 24, 1978, from the Associate Solicitor, Division of Indian Affairs,
Department of the Interior, and a memorandum dated April 17, 1978,
from the Assistant Secretary—Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior.

The memorandum report of the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs,
in which the Solicitor's office concurred, found that the attorney contracts
with the plaintiff tribe and assignments of interest were accurately
described in the petition and concluded, with regard to the claimed fee,
as follows:

While the tstal fee allowable in the case as compensation earned by the attorneys is not to exceed $102,380.86,
this Bureau did not participate in the litigation, thus,
we do not have sufficient detailed information upon which

to make a recommendation as to the amount of compensation
earned by :;e claims attorneys.

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 164 171

7. Attorneys’ Services. The attorneys who prosecuted the claim
herein gave legal advice and representation in support of the tribe's
position in the title proceeding, having prepared and presented legal
arguments and factual data to support the Commission's findings and opinion
on title which were favorable to the tribe.(2l Ind. Cl. Comm. 254 (1969)).
Thereafter, the tribe's attorneys performed extensive legal services in
preparing argument and evidence for the trial on value and in preparing
the brief and proposed findings supporting the tribe's interest in the
value proceeding. (See opinion and findings on value in this docket,

34 Ind. Cl. Com. 157 (1974)). The attorneys performed additional legal
services, including preparation for trial supporting the plaintiff's
interest in connection with the Commission opinion and additional
findings in the proceeding on the defendant's payments on the claim

2/
and the entry of the final award. (39 Ind. Cl. Comm. 300 (l977».

Considering the responsibilities assumed, the difficult problems
of law and fact herein presented, the time and work involved in successfully litigating this case, the award obtained, the contingent nature
of the compensation, and all appropriate factors pertinent to the determination of,attorney fees under Section 15 of the Indian Claims Comission

Act, 60 Stat. 1049, and standards established pursuant thereto, the

 

2/ The defendant appealed the award in this case to the Court of Claims.
The appeal related to certain issues on offsets. The tribes‘ attorneys
filed a cross-appeal. After the Court of Claims rendered a decision in
a case involving similar issues, both parties herein withdrew their
appeals which withdrawals were allowed by the Court of Claims orders
entered on December 2, 1977 (U.S. Ct. Cl. Appeal 3-77).

42 Ind. C1. Com. 164 172

Commission finds that the claims attorneys have rendered valuable legal
services to the plaintiff in this docket.
8. Conclusion. On the basis of the entire record in this docket,

the services rendered by the attorneys in these proceedings, the results

obtained, the contracts currently in force between the attorneys and
the plaintiff tribe, Section 15 of our Act, and in accordance with
standards obtaining for prosecuting similar claims in courts of law,
the Comission finds that attorneys herein are entitled to receive the
full 10 percent of the award as provided in Section 15 and in the above
cited contracts of employment.

The Commission further finds that the attorneys for plaintiff tribe
are entitled to an attorneys‘ fee in the gross amount of $lC2,380.86,
being 10 percent of the final judgmnt entered in this docket on January
28, 1977, and that payment to Rodney J. Edwards, attorney of record, of
said fee out of funds made available to pay the aforementioned judgment,
for appropriate distribution by him of the amounts due each of the
participating attorneys pursuant to their respective contracts and assignments, will represent payment in full of all claims for legal services

rendered in this docket. An appropriate order of the Commission will

issue concurrently with the findings herein.
