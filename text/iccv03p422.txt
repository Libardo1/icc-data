149. Eransportation of Household Effects of Special Attorney, $l86.§3 '

While the various contractual terms covering their employment
' are not beforeus, there is nothing in the acts appropriating tribal
funds throughout these years which indicates a practice on the part of
the Nation to pay the personal expenses of its attorney. 1116 cost Of.
transporting" household effects is a personal as distinguished from a
business expense, which personal expense in the absence of definite‘
assumption by another should-be borne by the party incurring it. -It
does not appear that the petitioner benefited as a. result of this erpenditure or authorized such expenditure and such iten is. disallowed.

Articles 1 and 2 of the 1865 treaty. Provisions furnished without a
