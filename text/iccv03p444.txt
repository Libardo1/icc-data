OPINION OF THE COMMISSION

JTITT, Chief Commissioner, deliirered the opinion of the Commission.

Qo._estions Presented l - -. '
The defendant has filed a. motion for smnma.."'y judgment as to all

claims alleged by the petitioner herein. whichnotion is based on the
decision of the court of Claims rendered on December 1, 1930, in suit
of the same petitioner against the defendant (71 C. 013. 308-3111). the
contention of the defendant being that the aforesaid decision awndicated

all the claims asserted in the instant case, or could have determined all

res judicata. and that defendant's motion for summary judgment should

 

be granted as to all and each of the claims herein asserted.
In order to determine the merits of said motion, it is necessary
to take into consideration the question of jurisdiction of the Court

of Claims by reason of the jurisdictional act under which the previous

.decision was rendered. whether or not the claims presented in the

instant case were heard and determined in the prior case or might have
‘been. and therefore, whether or not the plea of 3-_:e_s_ judicata should be
_st1sta.ined as to all the claims now ‘being prosecuted or as to any of
them. i j .
It is admitted ‘bydthe petitioner in the instant case that it was

a party to the prior case upon which the defendant relies for its plea

of res judicata; that the Court of Claims had jurisdiction to render

 

jndgmentrendered in the prior case, and that the defendant has discharged the judwent rendered in that case and paid for the land involved in the prior case at its value at the time of its taking by the
defendant, not including any interest hy reason of the delay in the
payment of said value.

Es claims will be taken up seriatim as discussed ‘by the defendant

in this motion for summary judgment.

Ehe First Claim--Claim for Interest

 

Thisis a claim for interest on the amount of the judgnent in the
previous case whereinthe Court awarded a judgment to the petitioner
‘for the amount of $1L,923,O93.1L'{ as compensation for 9,814.-6,186.93 acres.

It is being alleged ‘by petitioner that said award was for the value of

the land at the time of the taking; that just compensation for said lands
required. payment of the value as found by the Court in the amount of
$4,923,093.47, “together with damages for the delay in maltingppayment,
reasonably measured by interest at 5% from the date of taking to the date
of payment“, that said failure to maesaid award include damages for the
delay in making payment was contrary to the guarantee of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States,‘ and alternatively was not
‘ in keeping with fair and honorable dealings due by the defendant to the
petitioner. C I
The defendant shows that the petitioner asked for interest as a
part of just compensation for the land; the value of which it sued for,
-that the Court of Claims had jurisdiction to grant such interest, and
therefore the qciestionof whether or not the petitioner should recover

interest has been litigated and the decision relied on is res gudicata

as to same. '

Ehis Commission has _had two sir_:_iilar__cas_§s before it.’ to wit: The
Lssiniboine rz-its of Indians 17. ‘United States (Dkt. so. 62), the opinion
of the Comission in said case ‘being in Vol. II, :I;.C.C.. p. 272; and the
Blackfeet Tribe; ot_n1 v, tnited States (Dist. 279%), the opinion or the
Commission inthis case being in Vol, II. I.C.C.. p. 302. In each_of
these cases this Comissionheld that interest was a party of just compensation and that:it did not comprise a separa.te_and distinct claim from

that of the value of the land. and that previous decisions awarding the
value of the land became res judicata as to any claims of interest.
These decisions were appealed and were affirmed by the Court of Claims

and writs of certiorari denied by the Supreme Court, the Assiniboine

.. -_.
' . _ _ ‘ - -.-.rb_.:O

case being reported in vol. 128 C. Clst p. 617, and the Blackfeet case
being reported in Vol. 127 0. 01s. p. 807. Therefore, it is the opinion
of this Commission that the defendant*s motion for summar_7' judgment as

to this claim in this case should be sustained and the claim dismissed.

The Second claim

 

‘This is a. claim for additional compensation for lands ceded by the

petitioner to the defendant under the agreement between it and the

Unit_e_d_States dated ‘December 11%, 1885. and ratified by Act of Congress
on net-en 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 1032). It is contended by the petitioner
that under the terms of the said agreement it ceded all its right, title
and interest to approximately 1,800,000 acres of land fora stated consideration of $800,000.’ In inducing petitioner to sell its lands for

such a. small consideration, defendant 3(a) paid an unconscionable_consideration, hr (b) acted unfairly or dishonorably, or (c) took advantage
of a mistake of fact or law by either or bothof the parties thereto, as
to the area of land ceded’ by said agreement,’ or as to the value thereof“
and. therefore, is liable to the petitioner for the difference between

the amount paid for said land and its value at the time. The defendant

p contends that petitioner sets forth the same  in paragraphs VII.

VIII. and II of its amended petition in the previous case and “alleged
therein in substance the same kind and character of claimsdagainst defendant as now alleged“ in the instant suit. The defendant further
contends that under the jurisdictional act, the Court of Claims was
given authority “to hear and determine all legal and equitable claims,
if any. of said tribe against the United States and enter judgment

thereon.“ The defendant contends by reason of said language in said

jnrisdictionejl. act that. "it is clear from this statute that the Court
of Claims had jurisdiction to consider and determine the amount, if any,

dne said tribe, from the United States under any treaties, agreements,

or laws of Congress.“ That the langnage of the jnrisdictionalact did

not give the Court of Claims jurisdiction to determine the right of a "'
petitioner to additional compensation to that provided in an agreement
entered into by ireasonhfiof unconscionable consideration or because unfairly or dishonorably secured. is unquestioned; this Commission is
therefore of the opinion that the Court of Claims in the previous case

'did not have jurisdiction to consider such claim (if it did consider the

same) _and therefore the defendant's plea of res judicata is not good and

should be denied.

 

The Third Claim _ ‘

The Third Claim of petitioner is based on an nnratified agreement
between petitioner and defendant dated July 37, 1866 (II Kappler 1o52)
wherein it was agreed that petitioner would cede lands of the estimated
acreage of 200,000 acres for .a stipulated consideration; that the defendant took possession of said lands and failed to compensate petitioner
whatsoever therefor. The defendant’ contends that this claim was asserted
‘in substance“ and was “adjudicated "in the previous case as shown by
allegation contained in Paragraph X of the Amended Petition '(in said
previous case), brief, and motion for a new trial filed therein."
Reference to these pleadings shows conclusively that the claim as made
in the instant case was not asserted in the previous lawsuit relied

‘upon. It may further be stated that if the pleadings in the former

case were construed as asserting the same claim as in the instant case,

and was considered by the Court (which this Commission does not think

are facts), that same was not within the jurisdiction of the Court and

therefore not legally entitled to be considered by the Court. Attention

is called to the fact that the jurisdictional case under which the decision relied upon was made ‘authorizes the consideration of claims

against the United States “under any treaties, agreements, or laws of

Congress, or for the misapprvopriation of any of t,1j1;eéfunds of  tribes,

or for the failure of the United States to pay said tribes any money or

other property due.“ _

Certainly under the limitations of said act the

Court had no jurisdiction to consider a liability growing out of an

nnratified agreement becausethe same was not a binding agreement. Even

though the claim was presented, its consideration (if any was given to it

I

by the Court )_ was of no binding effect because of ‘the want of jurisdiction

to consider the same. Therefore, defendant*s plea of res judicata is

not well__tal:en and must be denied.

The Fourth Claim '_, ‘_ ' 

This is a claim by petitioner for compensation for lands it claims

to have owned outside of lands recognized as owned by it by the Fort

Laramie treaty, and petitioner‘s title thereto was Indian title, if any, and under the jurisdictional act the Court of Claims had no authority

to consider the matter of compensation to the petitioner for the taking

of the land involved, if it did consider the same -- which the petitioner

contends it did ‘not. The defendant contends that the petitioner in

the previous lawsuit alleged that its title to.the land had been

recognized by the defendant in the treaty of 1825.

The language of

petitioner‘s pleadings in the previous suit makes the general statement

—---I-:-- u-é--n-u--u-no-. o

..—.. .-.~._...—-u--_.-..n-..-u-.-—.n-u......-. . — . _ .. .-.. that by said treaty the defendant had “recognized the district of
country then occupied by them.“ Attention is called to the fact, however, that in the same petition petitioner alleged that it “with sundry

other tribes of Indians occupied, held and used“ this and other territory; and in its requested findings of fact the petitioners asked that

a. finding be made that "petitioner tribes of Indians from time immemorial had their habitat" in the lands involved. The holding of the

_ Court of Claims distinctly" limits the award made to lands set apart to

the petitioner by the Treaty of Fort Laramie, which lands do not include

' the land involvedin this claim; and regardless of the fact that compensation may have been asked f or_these lands in the prior lawsuit, the

Court of Claims had no jurisdiction to considenthe same and did not

consider thesame. Wherefore, this Commission 1510: the opinion that the 'defendant's plea for summary judgment based on res judicata is not well

taken and should be denied.

0 . The Fifth Claim_

 

This is a claim iforuallegedi unfair land exchanges. Petitioner

alleges thatby the Executive Orders of April l2, 1870 (I Kappler 883),

' Jun: 13, 1880 (I Kappler 883). and June 17, 1392 (I_Kappler 883). lends

r-ecogized by the Fort Laramie treaty were removed from petitioner‘s
reservation and other lands added thereto, in lieu of those removed. 
Petitioner contends that the lands taken from petitioner's reservation
were much more valuable than those that were added thereto and that
therefore petitioner is entitled to compensation therefor. Petitioner

alleges, and the decision of the Court confirms, that this claim was

never considered by the Court in said prior suit; that in its special

purpose of determining the quantity of land’ taken by the defendant; that

the Court did not take into consideration the difference in the value of

the land involved; that "it failed therefore to consider this claim on its
merits. Moreover, the jurisdiction of the Court in consideringsuch a

claimmight be questioned, but in any event, the Court did not consider
this claim on its merits and therefore the Commission is of the opinion
that the plea of the defendant for summary judgment. based on _r_e_s_
is not yell taken and should be denied.

The Sixth Claim

 

Ehis is a claim for damages in the amount of value of the use made
by defendant for its use of buildings, worizs and improvements, the cost
of which have been paid bypetitioner, or themarket value ‘thereof in
the alternative because of wrongful taking or the-use of the same by
the defendant. The claim as asserted by petitioner in paragraphs 28
to 31 of its petition and as described inuits objection tomotions of
defendant for. awry Judgment (pp. 15, 16, 28, 29) is very vague and
indefinite anddoubtless must be amended before trial; but, notwithstanding. as far as we have been able to determine in a careful exami-.

O

nation of pleadings in the prior case, no claim of this kind was asserted

therein and the petitioner contends that "the facts from which it arose

had not even occurred when that petition was filed." Therefore, it is

the opinion of this Commission that the motion of the defendant for

smmary judgent, based on res judicata, is not well taken and should be
denied.

The seventh Clam

 

This claim.is based on petitioner's contention that the taking of
petitioner’; lands, as detailed in its petition. under the Act of June 1,
1910 (36 Stat. ‘+55-1!-56-3458), without petitioner's consent and in
violation of defendant's duties and obligations as a guardian of petitioner as to petitioner's property, was-fnot in keeping with fair and
honorable treatment and was in violation of defendant's fiduciary duties
as guardian and trustee of petitioner and that, therefore. defendant has

become liable to the petitioner for just and equitable compensation for

A the lands involved and otherwise as fully set out in said petition. It

is doubtful if any such claim was within the jurisdictional act under
which the previous decision’ was rendered ‘but, in any event, the pleadings
in that case seem to present only a demand for an -accounting of the *

handling of the property and funds authorized by the defendant under the .

Act of June 1, 1910. The present claim seems to this Commission to_‘be

‘based on the’ contention that fair and honorable dealings were not accorded
the petitioner. and the failure to as so is the basis of this claim which
is an entirely different claim to that merely for an accounting for that

which had ‘been done. Therefore. it is the opinion of this Comission

that the motion for a sumary judgment, ‘based on res judicata as to said
claim, is not well taken and should ‘be denied.
%e Eighth Claim

‘N

This clam is ‘based on the alleged destruction of natural resources.
on petitioner‘s lands and is not specifically discussed in defendant's

motion. The claim is one ‘basedon the alleged lack of fair and honorable

dealings by the defendant in connection with its handling of petitioner‘s

lands. It was not vyithin the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims in the

litigation upon which the plea of res judicata isbased and therefore

 

could not and was not considered by said Court. Therefore, the plea of

res judicata as to same should be denied.

The Ninth Claim.

 

This is a claim for a general accounting of petitioner‘ s money and
property. Nowgsnch accounting was requested in the prior suit nor does
the defendant specifically discuss this claim on its motion for summary

judgent. In any event any accounting involved or discussed in the

previous litigation could not have been an accounting to the present

time and therefore the ‘previous decision could not be res judicata as to

the. present claim. Therefore, the defendant's request therefor should

be 6.3111 95.:

While the merits of the plea of res judicata as to all claims hasbeen discussed as to each one separately, attention will be "called to
the fact that the Court of Claims in the opinion relied upon states in

its opinion that the record in the case narrowed the issues "to three

claims”: first, "the alleged taking by the _Government of lands embraced s

within the Indians‘ reservation without their consent and without

compensation”; second, "a claim for $50,000 for the value of timber

alleged to have been cut and taken from their reservation by white

trespassers“; and, third, “the cost of surveying the inner lines of their‘

reservation in December 1836. it being charged that the expense incident

thereto was by express agreement chargeable to the United States and not

Attention is also called to the-_~defendant‘s proposed finding II

in the prior case wherein defendant urges the following finding:

 ;-Under the provisionsof this act, the plaintiffs herein,
the Indians of the Fort Berthold Reservation. North Dakota,
filed their petition on July 31, _l921¥, alleging a number of
claims against the United States. All of the claims set
forth in the petition have been abandoned by the plaintiffs
with the exception of‘-the following:

 

The_claim based upon the allegedimisappropriation by
the Government of parts of their alleged tribal domain by

the Executive Orders of April 12, 1870, and July 13, 1880,
defining and delimiting a reservation for the Arikara, Gros

Ventre, and Liandan Indians, the claim based upon alleged
depredations by white people upon the timber growing within
the boundaries of the country claimed by them; and the claim

- arising out of the alleged use of their funds by the Government
in defraying the emenses of the interior surveys of their "
diminished reservation under the agreement of December 11}, 1886,

ratified by the act oi_‘.}.Ia1-ch 3, i891. (Emphasis supplied.)_- _

This Commission had occasion in the Iowa. Tribe 1''. United States,
our Dl__:t._.No.. 79_ (Vol. II. _I.C.C‘., p. 167), to pass on the effect of
the withdrawal or abandoning of claims even though sued on and the
effect of the decision in which they were asserted as being _1_'_e_§_
Judicata as to the withdraxrnclaims, and in such situation’ we ‘held
that when claims, though previously asserted, were withdrawn “there
was not and could not have been an adjudication of any of them * * "'

in the former case." is supporting said viewpointwe referred to the

case of Stark v. Star, 914 U. S. 477. 1185, and quoted therefrom.
In keeping with this opinion, an order will be entered sustaining

I motion for sumary judgment as to the First Claim -— that is, the claim

for interest -- and will be denied as to all the other claims.
