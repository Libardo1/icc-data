read in part as follows:

The Sachems and Chiefs of the Sit Nations are, however,
aware of the impropriety of fbrm'ng any definitive resolution
on a measure i.e., removal from hen York? so materially
affecting the future condition and welfare of their people,
without the advice and approbation of the Government of the
U. States, that has so long cherished & protected them, and
to which they are closely united by the brightest chain of
peace and friendship.

The object of this memorial is, therefore, to enquire,
-3het.;er the Government will consent to our leaving our
present habitations andremoving into the neighborhood of
our Western Brethren?

Whether, 5.5 we should obtain, either by gift or purchase,
from our ‘vfesterin Friends, a seat on their lands, the C-overnment will ac}-cnowledge our title, in the save manner as it not:
ackno-zledges it, in th se from whom we may receive it. And,

Fhether our removal will be considered as changing, in any
manner, the relations non mbsisting between our several tribes
and the Coverrtmnt; or whether they will be perrrzitted to continue the same; and e:»:istir;g treati s still remain in force,
and annuities paid as heretofore.

We send this by our approved friends, C-en. Porter, who is a
member of your Council, and I’: . Crang r and Capt. Parrish,
whom you have given us, to watch over -:1: manage our affairs and
Horatio Jonas our Interpr t r. We have confidence in them,
and have invited than to our council fire. We there freely
communicated to  cv::~ wishes and views of the subject of
this I~";emorial, and to then we refer you for rzecessary explanations. ‘..‘1,' then also we hope to receive yoxr ar.s'.ver.

Detroit Nov. 11, 1820

SIR, While I was at Green Bay I understood.£rom Col. Boeyer,
that he had obtained a cession from the Indians of the Country
extending forty miles up the Fox River, & twenty-five or thirty
miles on each side of that Riv r. ‘I presume he transmitted to
‘you the instrument of cession, which he obtained.

I do not know the instructions, ehich he received, nor what
‘were the viers of he Government upon the subject. But I take
the liberty of expressing to you my doubt respecting the policy
of the measure. A purchase f the land in th immediate vicinity
of Green Bay, and inclu ‘ng all the settlements upon the Fox
River is certainly proper. It is proper with a view to the undisputed operation of the laws, and to relieve the inhabitant
from the disagreeable and anomalous situation, in which they are
placed. But more than this is not now required, and I presume
an immediate increase of the population in that Country'tg'erjagration is not anticipated.

The effect therefore of extinguishing the

‘(D (D

But th re is another consideration of much weight upon

this subject. I have reason to believe that the Six Eations
from Ken York would select a part of this Country for their
residence, and the poli y of permitting them to do it, cannot

be doubted. They reached this place last summer on their was

to Green Bay, but having heard that a purchase has been made

of the land to which their attention had been directed, they
returned.without accomplishing the object of their mission and
without mr having seen them. It is very desirable to place then
in that Country. Their habits and the strong pecuniary ties,

In

which bind then to the United States, would ensure their fidelity,

and they would act as a checkrupon the Winnebagoes, the worst
affected of any Indians upon our borders.

Under these circumstances, I would respectfully suggest‘
xhether it would not be expedient to delay acting upon the purchase ngde by Col. Sawyer and to direct his successors to procure a cession better suited to the objects'which the Governe

ment have in view.
Respectfully, Sir, I have the honour to be

to the Green Bay country, was not the intention of the United States

to compel them to emigrate, but that the country so accgured ‘as for

the future residence of such Indians of the Six Nations "as might choose

to emigrate thither." Secretary of ‘.~Ea.r Calhoun advised Stockbridge

Chie:-3' Eiendrick in a letter dated November 22, 1821, that he was pleased

at the success of the mission to Green Bay; and that the Treaty had been

approved by the President, "which is all the ratification that is

necessary as only those treaties to which the United States is a party
recurs the addition of the sanction of the Senate." ‘

In his letter to Eleazer ‘L-Iilliams, d-ted December 11, 1821 (the
date 1822 appearing on the manuscript letter is obviously incorrect),
Secretary of War Calhoun advised of the President's confirmation of the
treaty, that Governor Cass had been informed thereof and "instructed to
give the lndians of the Six Rations who may choose to emigrate to the

{D

rgea.t, J-. was appointed by Governor Cass
to accompany the delegation and to supervise the negotiations on the

part of the United States. In his letter to Sergeant, Governor Cass

stated:

SIR: The Secretary of War has authorized the Six Nations
from the St te of New York to procure from the Jenomonees an
extension of the cession'uhich.was made last year upon the
Fox river, and approved by the President of the United States.

The delegttion of the §eo'York.Indians will accompany you‘
to Green Bay, for the purpose; and, as the Indian agent is
not there, you are authorised to superintend the negotiation
on the part of the United States.

The object in procuring this cession is not only to provide a tract of country sufficient for the residence of these
Indians, but also to exclude from it, and from its vicinity,
any white settlements.

The advance which these Indians have made in improverent

which are due to then, secure their iriendship and fidelity

to the United States. and they will thus act as an important
advance post, in an exposed quarter, sh re they will be surrounded by doubtful or disaffected Indians. t is important,
therefore, that their situation should be as pleasant to
themselves as possible. And there is probably no consideration
connected with.the subject more important to than than the
certain tenure of their lands, and the power of preventing

the introduction of that bane of Indian 'uprovement, ardent

ll. Thereafter the new deputation proceeded to the Green Bay
area and on September 23, l822, a Treaty was concluded at Green Bay
between "deputies authorized and empowered to represent the Muheconnuk
er Stockbridge nation or tribe of Indians, the First Christian Party
of the Oneida Nation, * % % the Tuscarora Nation, % % % the St. Regis L
Nation, % % % and the Munsee Nation, and the chiefs and headmen of the
Menominee Nation." The proceedings were supervised and the Treaty was
witnessed by John Sergeant, Jr., Agent on behalf of the Government of
the United States, and was signed, sealed and delivered in the presence
of Colonel Pinckney and other officers of the garrison at Ft. Howard
near Green Bay; By this Treaty the Menominee Nation conveyed to the
Stockbridge Nation, the First Christian Party of the Oneida Nation, the
Tuscarora Nation, the St. Regis Nation, and the Munsee Nation, a large
tract of land comprising approximately 7,h80,000 acres, bounded and

described as follows:

"beginning at the foot of the rapids on Fox River, usually
called the Grand Kakalin; thence southeast (or on the lower
line of the lands last season ceded by the Menomonee and
‘Winnebago nations of Indians, to the Six Nations, St. Regis,
Stockbridge, and Munsee nations), to or equidistant with the
Hanawahkiah river, emptying into Lake Michigan; thence on an
easterly course to and down said river to its mouth; thence

5 572

northerly, on the borders of lake Michigan, to and across the
mouth of Green Bay, so as to include all the islands of the
westerly course, to a place on the northwest shore of lake
Michigan, generally known and distinguished by the name of
Weyohquatonk by the Indians, and Bay de Noque by the French;
thence a westerly course, on the height of land separating

the waters running into Lake Superior and those running into
lake Michigan, to the head of the Menomonee river; thence
continuing nearly the same course, until it strikes the north»
eastern boundary line of the lands ceded as aforesaid by the
Menomonee and Winnebago nations to the Six Nations, St. Regis,
Stockbridge, and Munsee nations of Indians, in eighteen hundred
and twentyaoneg thence southerly to the place of beginning."

The grantees agreed that the Menominees "shall have the free permission
and privilege of occupying and residing upon the lands herein ceded in
common" with the grantees, provided they “shall not in any manner infringe upon any settlements or improvements whatever, which may be in
any manner made by the said Stockbridge, Oneida, Tuscarora, St. Regis,
or Munsee Nations."

In consideration of this cession, the grantees paid the sum of
$1,000.00 in goods, and agreed to pay the further sum of $1,000.00 one
year from the date of the treaty and also $1,000.00 two years from the
date of the treaty, to be paid in goods, all of which payments were duly

made.

The 1822 cession extended to the south as far as the Milwaukee

River, referred to in the treaty as the Manawahkiah River, and the entire _

cession is properly set forth and designated by the blue lines on petitioner‘s map Exhibit lh2 and consisted of 7,h80,000 acres, exclusive of
major water areas.

In addition, the Henominees owned a large tract of

land lying southwest of the 1822 cession comprising in excess of 2,500,000

acres. At the time of the execution of the treaty the boundaries of the

Menominee lands had not been specifically defined, especial " the ividingi

line on the north between the Menominee and Chippewa lands. Ultimately
in the Treaty of August 19, 1825, at Prairie du Chien (7 Stat. 272) and

in the Treaty of August 11, 1827, at Butte des Morts (7 Stat. 303) the
boundaries of the Menominees were fixed and said boundaries are properly
set forth and designated by red hash marks on petitioner‘s Exhibit lh2
and consisted of 7,hl0,l20 acres, exclusive of major water areas. The
boundaries of the Menominee lands, as thus ultimately determined, did
not extend as far to the north as the cession to the New York:Indians

in 1822, so that the territory described in that cession was therefore
reduced, the outer limits thereof being thus designated by the red hash
marks included within the blue lines shown on petitioner's map Exhibit

lh2. As thus reduced, the lands ceded in 1822 comprise an area of

3,931,000 acres, exclusive of major water areas.
12. The Treaty of September 23, 1822, was presented by Secretary

of War Calhoun to President Monroe, who approved the treaty on March 13,

1823 with qualifications as follows:

The foregoing instrument is approved, so far as it

conveys to the Stockbridge, Oneida, Tuscarora, St. Regis,
and Munsee tribes or nations of Indians, that portion of
the country therein described which lies between Sturgeon
key, Green Bay, Fox river, that part of the former purchase
made by said tribes or nations of Indians of the Menomonee
and Winnebago Indians, on the 8th of August, 1821, which lies
south of Fox river, and a line drawn from the southwestern

. extremity of said purchase to the head of Sturgeon bay, and
no further; that quantity being deemed sufficient for the use
of the first beforemmentioned tribes and nations of Indians.
It is understood, however, that the lands, to the cession of
which to the tribes or nations aforesaid the Government has
assented, are to be held by them in the same manner as they
were by the Menomonees, previous to concluding and signing
the aforegoing instrument; and that the title which they
have acquired.is not to interfere, in any manner whatever,
with the lands previously acquired or occupied by the Government of the United States, or its citizenso

5 57h

The boundaries of the land described in President Monroe's approval are properly set Ibrth and designated by the green lines on

petitioner's map Exhibit lh2 and included that part of the cession of
September 23, 1822, Lying south and east of the Fbx River and Green

Bay, extending to the Milwaukee River on the South, to Lake Michigan

ion the east, and to Sturgeon Bay on the north? comprising an area of

1,557,000 acres, exclusive of major water areaso
13. The petitioners promptly protested against the apparent

limitation of the area of the 1822 cession which seemed to have been
imposed by the President's limited approval and.requested clarification
thereof. The Ogden Land Company, was the owner of the prememption
rights to lands owned and occupied by the Indians in the State of New

York. Its representatives also objected to the limited nature of the

Presidential approval and requested an extension thcreofo On October 27,

1823, Secretary of war Calhoun advised the chiefs of the New York

Indians as follows:

BROTHERS,

I have received your memorial in a letter from your
friend Era Ellis representing that you have received in»
formation that your Green Bay treatv5 held last Season
with your brethren the Eenomenees had been but partially
confirmed by your Great Father the Presidents

Brothers ~ In answer to your memorial I have to say that _
you had the free consent of your Father the President to hold
the treaty which you have concluded with the Menomenees, and
he has not now the least objection to the arrangement which
has been entered into between you and the Menomenees in its
fullest extent. But when the Government is called on for its
special sanction to said arrangement it cannot so further than
to sanction it in part as it has doneh confirming to you as
much land as is believed to be sufficient for your accommodation.
But your great father the President xiiling to comply with the
wishes of his Red Children as far as “c can and anxious for

confirmed by said approval a l““ger extent of Coun ry and

on that it is understood will be more acceptable to you.

The coun ry that will be confirmed to you by the proposed
change, is that part of the lands embraced by your said arrangement with the Kenomenees n'ich lies between the Menomenee
River and the former grant of l82l, extending on the East to
Green Bay and Fox River and on th ‘heat to a line to be drawn from
the high lands between Lakes Kichigan.& Superior to the Southern
line of the former grant just mentioned containing near two
millions of acres--Before, however, the President gives his
approbation in the manner proposed, he deems it proper that

you should absolve the government from its former sanction by

a formal relinquishment of the lands thereby confirmed to you,
so as to leare all the lands comprehended by the arrangement
referred to, subject to its operations as it originally stood

between you and the henomenees, without the interference of

the government. a ,

to this Depar'ment the relinquishment required with the perchu

he will set his approbation in due form agreeably to your request on the parchment now on file in this Department, confirming
to you the lands within the boundaries before described.

‘Brothers, Your erect father the ?resident wishes you distinctly

to understand, that he does not mean, by the partial sanction which

he has, or may give, to the arr" genent between you and the henonenees,
to interfere with, or in any manner invalidate your title to all

the lands which you have thereby acquired, including those not
confirmed by the government. On the contrary he considers your

title to every part of the country conveyed to you by the Kenomenses as eoually valid against them, and has no objection to
your occupying and using the same, as if the whole had been
confirmed by the government. The acquiescence of he government
therefore in the arrangement to the whole extent, al*ho' it does
not think proper to give its special sanction so far, affords

On November 27, l823, Secretary of Ear Calhoun wrote Governor Cass,

enclosing a copy of the foregoing message to the chiefs of the New York

Indians. Secretary of her Calhoun stated in part:
“The enclosed copy of a talk in reply to a Memorial
from the six nations, will put you in possession fully
of the views of the Government on this subject, which you
can also communicate to ‘hilliams for his information,
and through him, or the agent at Green Bay, to the Indians
interested in that vicinity, and which it is presumed, will
satisfy then, as well as th. hen York Indians, and remove
all further difficulty to the one erecntinn n? the treaty
referred to in its whole extent. on their parts respectivelr.“

On :ebruary'3, 1826, James Barbour, then Secretary of Rh“, reported

to the House Committee on Indian éffairs on a proposed bill for the re\

moral of the Indians from their residences rithin'the-Stctes. The SecreI

tar? Of War proposed.that the country west of the hississippi and beyond
the States and territories and so much thereof east of the Iiississi, pi
as lies west of Lakes Huron and Michigan should be set apart for the
abode of the Indian tribes. In that connection, the Secretary of War

stated: .

In adopting the limits prescribed in the bill, I have pursued
the plan heretofore proposed. In including the lands as a
part lying between Lakes Michigan and Huron, and the river
"Mississippi, I have been governed as well by the above consideration, as the fact that it is now in occupancy of the
Indians, and, from its natural features, is not desirable at
present for the habitation of our citizens.

The princ‘pal reconnendation ~f this plan, next to the
ac'antaaes to he gained by ourselves, is, that th future

that the Indians involved went off to Drummond's Island, which was the

focal point of British influence in the area, stating that when they

returned "they would.make the earth tremble.“ Agent Brevoort took appropriate measures to squelch.any threatened uprising. On September 21,

182k, certain white inhabitants at Green Bay, principally the Grignons,

protested to the President against the settlement of the hen York:Indians

The United States, in compliance with its promises, for a period
of several years took appropriate measures to protect the

Indians. The protection afforded to the Emigrant N n'York:Indians by

The conduct of these sett ers, from the representation.nhich has been made of it, is highly reprehensible

and cannot be suffered by the government with impurity;

I an accordingly directed by the Secretary of War to
instruct you, forthwith to'take strong measures to suppress effectually, such improfor and dangerous interference,
and to prevent the evil consequences which in is calculated
to produce, by rigidly enforcing against all who may be found,
or knonn.to be engaged in it the provisions of the law of
intercourse. The commanding officer of the Post is ordered
to cooperate nith.you. Should it be necessar*, in carrying
these instructions into effect a copy of the order is enclosed.

It is very important to preserve peace between the Indians

at Green Bay and th §ew'York:Indians who may join them, the

arrangement between then to this effect having been made with

the sanction-of the government, gives them a peculiar claim

to protection against the acts of designing and intermeddling

white men.

19. During the third decade of the nineteenth century, the United
States desired.to have the various Indian tribes inhabiting what is now
the State of Wisconsin and adjacent territory fix definite boundaries to
the lands claimed by each of such tribes, and the United Stctes entered
into treaties'with.them for that p*rpose. One of such treaties was th
Treaty of Pra'rie du Chien, entered into on August 19, 1825 (7 Stat. 272)
between the United States and the Sio=t and Chippewa, Sac and Fox,
Hen-nines, Zoway, Sioux, Winnebago, and a portion of the Ottawa, Chippewa
Treaty the aforesaid cession of land
by the Kenominees to the Enierant Eew York Indians was recognized by

The representatives of the Kenominees not being sufficiently acquainted with their prooer boundaries, to settle
the same definitely, and some uncertainty existing in consequence of the cession made by that tribe upon Fox River
and Green Bay, to the New York Indians, it is agreed between

V

htne said henominee tribe, and the Sgoux, Chippewas, tinnebaices, Ottawa, Chippera and Potanatomie Indians of the
lllinois, that the claim of the Kenoninees to any portion

of the land within the bou daries allotted to either of th
same shall remain as valid as if this treaty had not been
concluded. t is, however, understood that the general
claim of the Henominees is bounded on the north by the
Chippewa country, on the east by Green Bay and lake Hichigan
extending as far south as Hilawauhee river, and on the west
they claim to Black River.

ARTICEE 10.

All the trites aforesaid acknowledge the general controlling ?crer of the United States, and disclaim all
dependence upon, and connection with, any other power. And
the United States agree tn and recognize, the preceding
boundaries, subject to the limitations and restrictions
before provided. It being, however, well understood that
the reservations at Fever River, at he Ouisconsin, and St.
Peters, and the ancient settlements at Prairie des Chiens
and Green Bay, and the land.property thereto belonging, and
thetreservations made upon the hississippi, for the use of
the half breeds, in the treaty concluded witn'the Sacs and
Foxes, August 2L, 182b, are not claimed by either of the
said.tribes.

The United States agree, whenever the President may'think

u necessary and.prober, to convene such of the tribes, either

unsett.ed.herein, and to recommend to than an amicable and

t would also be proper to provide for distinct boundaries
between our settlement upon Fox river and the Indian lands.
The subject has been left undefined since the occupation of
the Country by the French, and much difficulty has been the

consequence. Ixcould also suggest the propriety of acoing

to our cession there. The Country is valuable and would

settle; and it is important to increase the physical strength
and resources of that region.

On.Harch 27, before receipt of Governor Cass’ letter-by the War DepartVa

nent, Secretary of War Barbour wrote Governor Cass and Colonel hchenney
instructing them to hold a council with the Indians at some point near
Green Bay for the purpose.of establishing the Indian tribal boundaries

not completed the Tree ' of Prairie du Chien and ..antin leave for

the Brotherton Indians to send a deputation to the council. On April ll,

l827, Colonel hcKenney wrote the 5ecreta.' of tar, stating:

“I have the honor to enclose herewith a letter from Gov.

Cass. You will perceive that your _nstructions to the Conmissioners anticipated His Exys views in all that regards
the Henonini &‘Einnebagoes; but the two last suggestions
could not be known'to the Department--their never haying
been any report upon them, viz:—-the subject of distinct
boundaries betneen.our settlement upon Fox river, and the
necessity for adding to our cession there. Gov. Cass gives
good reasons why both should be done; and I have the honor
to recommend that for your signature the accompanying additional instructions to the Con:rr=.i:.=sioners." p
On that same day the Secretary of Va: wrote Colonel HcKe-ney and Governor

22. Zn august of l82? Governor Cass and Colonel Mchenney, as
Commissioners, conducted a.treaty council at Butte des Kort on the
Fox River near Green Bay.

The Commissioners appointed two chiefs to represent the Menominees

at the Treaty council,

viz. Oshkosh and Josette, also known as Joseph
Curron, who were the two young Henoninees who had been instrumental

in stirring up difficulties for the Ken York Indians at the behest of

the French settlers in 1825 and."h V=“°

and Jinnebagoes were represented at the council by Judge Doty, who was
himself opposed to the claims of the New York Indians which were adverse to his own personal interest as a land speculator. In the course
of the council the claims of the Ehdarant Kes'Zork Indians and of the
Menominees and Winnebagoes were presented for the consideration of the

C nnissioners.

Article 2 of the Treaty alleaed the existence of ciiiiculoies between the

--J

Menominee and'winnabago tribes and the Emigrant New York Indians, and

then recited:

t is agreed by the Menomonies and'Hinnebagoes, that so
far as respects their interest in the premises, the whole
matter shall be referred to the President of the United.States,
whose decision shall be final. And the President is authorized,
on their parts, to establish_such boundaries between them and
the hen York Indians as he may consider equitable and just.

Under.article 3 of the treaty, the henominees ceded a tract of land to

the United States in.the vicinity of Green Bay described as follows:
Beginning on the shore of Green Bay, six miles due north
from the parallel of the mouth of Fox river, and running
thence in a straight line, therefrom to the intersection
of the continnation.of the westerly boundary of the tract
at the Grandhaukaulin, claimed by Augustin Grignion; thence
on a line with the said boundary to the same; thence with
the same to Fox river; thence on th same course, siximilesg
thence in a direct line to the southwestern boundary of the
ract, marked on the plan of the claims at Green Bay, as the
settlement at the bottom of the Bay; thence with the southerly
boundary of the said tract to the southeasterly corner thereof;
and thence with the easterly boundar” of the said tract to
Green Bay;

with the proviso that if the President hould be of ooinion that the
boundaries thus established interfered with the just claims of the has

Indians, the President could change the boundaries in any:manner

that he might thi_k proper, so that the quantity of ‘and contained in

the tract be not greater than as defined in the treaty.

Under date of Novernher 6, 1827, the Brotherton Indians also
protested to the President against the Treaty of Butte des Morts and
the machinations of the white settlers at Green Bay ”in persuading the
Menominee and ‘S.-Iinnebagoes to deny that they had sold the land to the
New York Indians--hoping they could recover the land back. and sell it

again to the United States _, although they had been fairly and honestly

_ paid for it before by the New York Indians.“ .

President John Quincy Adams spoke to Colonel I-Iciienney of the
protests made by the Brotherton and Stockbridge Indians against the
Treaty of Butte des I-iorts, but Colonel Mciienney gave the President no
satisfactory answer to the claim of the New York Indians “who allege
that the lands ceded by the treaty had already been ceded sev._.ral y are
since, with the approbation ‘of this Government, to than." President
Adams like-vise adverted to the inconsistent nature of the Government's
policy toward the Indiansand wrote, “In the instance of the New York

Indians removed to Green Bay and of the Cherokees removed to the Territory oi‘ Arkansas, we have scarcely given than time to bu&d their, wig'ams before we are called upon by ourmm people to drive then out again."

Fol...owing additional protests by the Emigrant New York Indians,
the Treaty of Butte des Morts ultimately was ratified by the Senate on
February l9, 1829, with the proviso that "The said treaty shall not
impair or affect any right or clairrl which the Na York Indians, or any
of them, have to the lands, or any of the lands, mentioned in said
treaty."

to Green Bay, select a suitable area within the limits of the country

respect to the contentions of the Emigrant New York
Indians on the one side and the henominees,‘Ninnehagoes, French settlers

The Commissioners attempted, unsuccessfully3 to obtain the consent

They disposed of those objections as follows:
To the first cession it is objected now, and has been

heretofore, especiall" by Four legs (Wi33€bE€0 Chief),

that they never gave to the Raw York Indians liberty to

settle above the Little Chute. To thi objection it may

be answered that the Ninnebagoes never clahned to own below

the Little Chute nor had they any lodges on the right bank

of Fox river or the eastern shore of the lake, and included
within the lines of the cession. Four legs has since that

time seated himself on the Island at the outlet of the lake.

It is fairly inferable from the report of Mr. Trowbridge to

Gov. Cass in l82l that the dinnebagoes did not even claim as

far down the river as the Little Chute, for when the henominees
had refused to sell to the New York Indians the former “expressed
a great deal of sorrow at their answer and proposed to give their
brethern of the east the land on the For river from the Grand chute,

to the Einnebago lake, a distance of four and a half m1_esa" It
is not probable they would have offered to grant so far down the
river and still retain a narrow strip oelov. The report oont'nues:
"Perceiving that thelhenoninees were astonished at this reply"t
was thought advisable to adjourn the council with a view to give

them time for refl cticn. On.the following day they met the
deputies again and having stated that their minds were changed,
the lands
the foot of the Grand Kackalin to rapids of the'hinnebago lake."
The treaty made in pursuance of this proposition vas signed
Four Legs and Black wolf. The sane chiefs the next year signs
the receipt for the last payment, and.they were the only”hinnebago chiefs who spoke in Coun il at our late session. Four legs
could not have been deceived.or:mistahen in the extent or nature
of the cession. he is a cunning artfulinan. He then resided
near the outlet of the lake, on the left and just above the
rapids. e facts it appears to the Commissioners that
the hinnehagces had no colour of a claim to the lands in question
except the right of hunting and

1. That all their chiefs did not join in the treaty

and some of those who did were not authorized.

2. That they did not intend to sell their lands but

only to permit their eastern brethren to come
and live anon then.

The first objection is answered by a reference to th
recognition of the treaty by the whole nation. In the
first place they received the several payments and divided
them among "e nation according to custom. After their

L:
s a renonstrance against the treaty to Gov.
Cass to be f rwarded to the Government, they received and
distributed the last payment in Jovember, l82h, and thereupon applied.to Major Brevoort, the U. S..Agent, to send
on a counternand.

the New York Indians only about 300,000 acres while leaving to the
Henominees an nmnense tract of 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 acres. Commissioner
Kason dissented from the report partly upon the ground that the question
of the validity of the Treaties of l82l and 1822 was "a subject reserved
by the President for himself to consider."

28. On September 1, l830, the Council at Green Bay'was adjourned
by the Commissioners. On the afternoon of the same day Commissioners

the boundaries of the Menominee country, including therein the greater part
of the territory which had been purchased by the lnigrant New York Indians
in l82l and l822. Under the first article of the Treaty the Menmtinees,
although protesting that they were under no obligation to recognize any
claims of the New York Indians to any portion of their country, ceded

to the United.States a tract of land therein described comprising an

area of SO0,000 acres, to be set apart by the President of the United States
as a home for the several tribes of New York Indians who might remove to

at the end of said period.o time the President has empowered to apportion
the land among the actual occupants, so as to assign lOO acres for each
person actually settled upon the lands, with the remainder to revert to

the United States. The United States agreed to pay theihencminee Indians

Nine days later, on February l7, 1337, the Treaty

was amended to provide that the President in his discretion should pre~

scribe the time for the removal and settlement of the New York Indians,
instead of the three-year period established by the original Treaty, and
that at the expiration of such reasonable time, he should.apportion the
land.among the actual settlers in such:manner as he should deem equitable
and just, rather than on the basis of 100 acres for each individual. It
was further provided that if within such reasonable time as the President

should prescribe for that purpose, the New York Indians

should refuse to

30. On February 28, 1831, the S amoaugh Treaty was referred to the
Senate Committee on Indian.Affairs, together with certain documents,
including a letter from Secretary of War John H. Eaton to the President.
In this letter the Secretary of‘Nar asserted, in contradiction of the
views of his predecessor in that office and of other responsible governme.t officials before and after his time, that the treaties of 1821 and
1822 were invalid because not ratified by the Senate, pursuant to the
12th Section of the Trade and Interoonrse Act of 1802, and because he
deemed the consideration paid.by the Ken York Indians was inadequate;
Therefore he explained that, in entering into the Treaty, "it did not
occur-to me as proper to present the demand of the New York Indians as
a.matter resting upon right and justice." The Emigrant New York Indians
protested against the ratification of the Treaty and the Senateadjourned
without taking action thereon. Although the nomination of Colonel
tambaagh as Indian.Agent at Green Bay has rejected by the Senate, he

was appointed to accompany the Henoninees back to Green Bay with instructions to explain the Treaty to them, to explore the country, and to

make a report thereon.

32. The Stambaugh Treaty was ratified by the Senate on June 25,
1832, with certain amendments changing the location of lands to be set
apart for the New York Indians souas to provide two townships on the
east side of Winnebago Lake for the use of the Stockbridge and Munsee
tribes, and one township on the east side of Winnebago Lake for the
use of the Brotherton Indians, and for payment for the improv'ments of
said tribes which necessarily ‘would have to be relinquished by them
if they were to remove to the land so set apart for them, and alterin,
the boundaries of the 503,009 acre tract set apart for the remainder
of the New Yori Indians on the west side of Fox Riv r.

33. Thereafter, Governor Porter was directed to obtain the assent
of the Menominees to the amended Treaty or, failing to do so, to secure
their consent to the most practicable terms short of those proposed by‘
the Senate, and also to obtain the consent of the New York Indians to
any arrangeanent reached with the I-Eenominees. Governor Porter proceeded
to Green Bay, where, fter lengthy n gotiations, he entered into a supplementary Treaty on October 2?, 1832, between the United States and

the arbitration, entered into a separate deal witn on§

The defendant induced and encouraged the Emigrant New York Indians
to sell their land and leave their homes in the State of New York in the
belief that the defendant would recognize their rights in the Green Baytract that they had purchased from the Hencninees in l822 and accordingly
would xercise its powers as a guardian or trustee to protect those rights.
The defendant failed to exercise its powers and to observe its duties as
guardian or rustee to protect the rightssoi the Emigrant New York Indians,
but on the contrary acquired for itself the lands purchased by'the New
York Indians in 1822 and dealt with than for its own account and.profit.

By failing to carry out its promise to protect the Emigrant Lew
York Indians in the possession of such lands as they'might acquire from
their western'brethren; by acquiring such land for its own account from

the Menomineesg by acquiring such lands after assuming to act as an

arbitrator of an alle ed dispute between the Hencminees and the New York

Indians; by excluding the Emigrant New York Indians from said.lands and
by failing to accoun to them for the proceeds of the sale thereof, the
defendant violated.the standards of fair and honorable dealings with

respect to the Emigrant hen York Indians.
