FDJDINGS OF FACT

 

The Indian Claims Commission having heard the above entitled
cause, upon the evidence suT:mit'?:.ed, makes the following findings of fact:
1. The petitioner herein, The Osage Nation of Indians, is an Indian
tribe residing within the territorial limits of the United States and, as
such, is authorized to naintain this action under Section 2 of the Act
creating the Indian Claims Commission. (Act of august 13,, 1946, 60 stat.
1049). The petitioner is composed of two goups, known as. the Great and

Little Osage tribes, and its transactions with the United States, hereafter

1 Ind. C1. Comm. 43

.--2--s-to be referred to, were in name of and in behadf of the Great and Little
Osage Indians.

The petitioner herein seeks an award against the defendant
for the market value of 865,930.33. acres of land, hereinafter described,
which it ceded to defendant by a treaty dated September 29, 1865, ‘less.
the amount paid by defendant as consideration for said olandiand: less
the ‘cost of surveying and selling the same. It is the contention of
petitioner that the mar? at value of the land greatly. eicceeded the
consideration paid by the Government and the cost‘ of surveying and
selling it. i - i

2. (la) Long prior to the year J-.862 the claimant occupied a large’

area of territory in the State of Kansas, which included the tracts.

hereafter described.
(b). Early in the year 1862 negotiations for the acquisition of
parts of that area by the United States were started and resulted in a ‘

treaty dated August 29, 1863 (4 Kapp. 1129) between the petitioner and
the defendant which contained, among others, the following provisions:

Article I. “The” tribe of. the Great and Little Osage
Indians having now more lands than are necessary for their
occupation, and all pa;n:=.er.ts from the Government to them
under former treaties having ceased, leaving them greatly
impoverished, and being desirous of improving their con-dition by disposing 01‘ their surplus lands do hereby grant
and sell to the United States, the lands contained within
the following boundaries, that is to say, beginning at the
South East corner of their present Reservation and running
thence North with the Eastern boundary thereof fifty miles
to the Northeast corner; thence ‘Jest with the Northern
line thirty miles; thence South fifty miles to the Southern
boundary of said Reservation and thence East with said.

"Southern boundary thirty miles, to the place of
beginning; and in consideration of the grant and

States, and interest thereon at the rate of five per
centum.per annum shall be paid to said tribe semiw
annually in money, clothing, provisions or such articles
of utility as the Secretary of the Interior may from
time to time direct."

"Article 2. The said tribe of Indians also hereby

code to the United States a tract of land twenty miles

in width from Earth to South off the North side of the
remainder of their present Reservation and extending

its entire length from East to west; which land is

to be held in Trust for said Indians and to be sold for
their benefit by the Secretary of the Interior under

such rules and regulations as he may from.time to time
prescribe, the proceeds of such sales, as they accrue,
after deducting all expenses incident to the proper
execution of the Trust shall be placed in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of said tribe of
Indians, and the interest thereon at the rate of five

per centum per annum shall be expended annually for building houses, purchasing agricultural implements and stock
animals, and for the employment of a physician and mechanic
and for providing such other necessary aid as will enable
said Indians to commence agricultural pursuits under
favorable circumstances; provided, that twenty five per

. centum.of the net proceeds arising from the sale of said
Trust lands until said per centage shall amount to the sum
, of Eighty Thousand Dollars, shall be phaced to the credit

of the school fund of said Indians and the interest thereon

(c) This treaty was submitted to the Senate and on July 2,
1864, was ratified with certain amendments. Thereafter, the treaty
with the Senate amendments was submitted to the Indians and the amendments ere fully explained to the Chiefs and headmen, their representatives, who, on the 17th day of February, 1865, assented to part of the

Senate amendments, rejected part, and proposed an amendment of their
own.  (Def..Ex. 7)» i
(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 16 of the

treaty, the then acting Ccmmissioner of Indian Affairs considered

the changes in the treaty by the amendments of the Senate and those of
the Osages as of such acharacter as to make the treaty unfit for publicattion and he proposed the preparation of another treaty embodying the ‘
amendments of both parties. (Def. Ex. 8). This proposal was approved
by the Secretary of the Interior and a substituted treatyembodying

the changes made by the Senate and the Osage Indians was prepared, including the boundary alteration demanded by the Osages,

3. The new draft of the l863 treaty (which, with slight amendments,
became the treaty of September 29, 1865, hereafter referred to) was
submitted to the representatives of the Great and Little Osage Indians
at Fort Smith, Arkansas, at which place the proposed treaty, which
had'been prepared by the Secretary of the Interior, was interpreted
and.explained to the representatives of the Osages at Fort Smith by

one.Alexender Beyett, who is described in the treaty as ‘Interpreter

iosage Nation!. The treaty was, after some deletions and interlineatiens,

1 Ind... C1. Comm. 43 47

-*5“

signed by the representatives of the United States and the representaptives of the Little Osage (Southern) group at Fort Smith shortly before

the 29th day of September, 1865, but the representatives of the Great
Osage (Northern) group-did not sign at that place because they were not
authorized to execute it. However, the treaty-was later submitted to
the Great Osages in council at Canville Trading Post in Kansas, and.
after the terms thereof were fully explained to them by an interpreter,
one L; P. Chouteau, the Great Osage branch executed the treaty on the
29th day of September, 1865. Immediately preceding the signatures
of the chiefs'there appears in the treaty the following statement:

"We the undersigned chiefs and headmen of the Clarmont

and Black Dog Band of the Great Osage Nation in council

at Fort Smith, Ark., have had the foregoing treaty read.

and explained in full by our interpreter L; P. Chouteau

and fully approve the provisions of said treaty made by

our brothers the Osages, and by this signing make it our

act and deed"o

The following chiefs of the Osage Indians signed the unproclaimed treaty of 1863 and the treaty of l865.

White Hair (described-as Principal Chief of Osage Ration in
1865 treaty); Beaver (described as second chief of white Hair's Band
in 1865 treaty); Clarmont (described as Chief of Clarmont Band in
1865 treaty) or Clarmore (as shown in 1863 treaty); and, perhaps,
the witness to the treaty of 1865, Na~ta—ton-on?wa§ki, is the same
‘warrior as Nagtagtankawake, who signed the 1863 treaty.
