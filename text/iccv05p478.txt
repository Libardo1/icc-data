P'Commission entered on July lh, 1950, in the case en'itled."The Chickasaw

defendant’s motion under our rules. ‘We shall not stop to discuss each
procedural question other than to say that the motion sufficiently raises
the questions upon which the claim may be disposed of}

The Leased District was ceded to the defendant by the Treaty of
April 28, 1866, ' St t. 769, by the Choctaw and Chickasaw Tribes. After
this cession the defendant placed the Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians on

The Chickases.-I Nation did not appeal to the Court of C15-3=L“.'1S from the
final judgment of July lb, l9SO, and said judgment remains intact. NO? the Choctaw appeal.

What the petitioner now before us, Docket No. 267, which was the
sarae_petitioner in Docket Ho. 23 above referred to, is seeking is the
relitigation of its former claim which included the lands allotted to the
‘Wichita (l69,6OO acres), those allotted to the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache
(5'a§,OGO-acres) an those reserved for schools, etc. (lC,3lO acres). If
the Chic1ca.sa';: felt aggrieved by the action of the Conmission in denying
compensation therefor, they had recourse by appeal to the Court of Claims.
This, as we have said above, they did not do and, incidentally, they have’
accepted the award, as we are advised- ~

Counsel for petitioner does not question defend:-int‘s right to rely
on res adjudicate as a defame. Ifor could it in the face of the decisions:
Blackfeet et al. v. United States, 2 Ind. Cls. Com. 302-25; 127 C. Cls.

excluded the allotted lands and the reserved lands from considertion and
allowed no compensation therefor; (2) that we decided the case under

clause (3) of Section 2 of the Indian Claims Comission Act and therefore

could not .'E°."v'€ adjudicated any‘ claim under clause (5), the fair and '::onor- _

were included in the area claimed in the former suit. It is hard to

J.

foll w the reasoning of oetitioner’s counsel that because the Chickasaw
were not allowed compensation for their interest in those lands such

lands were excluded from the consideration of the Commission when the very‘

.J'

fact that
they were considered by the Commission. In these circumstances the petitioner's recourse was to appeal and not having done so they are bound by

the judgent. Reed ‘J’. Allen, 286 U. S. 191.
The second proposition urged by the Chickasaw is also without merit.
It is stated that because we decided the former case under clause (3) of

section 2 of the Indian Claims C :"'a$ sion act -- ‘the unconscionable con.L

Y'|'f1 !‘4'~4--\s-} #3 r‘; U

fair and honorable dealings as this would constitute an entirely different

cause of action." The effect of that contention is that the Chic}-:asa‘n
had a cause of action based upon unconscionable consideration and a separate
and distinct cause of action based upon unfair and dishonorable dealings,
and having failed to obtain the relief emected under the first suit, could.
bring a second suit based upon clause (5), the fair and honorable dealings
clause. Of course there is no basis for the contention.
the Chickasaw had only one claim and that was for their interest in the

7,713,620 acres of land comprising the Leased District. They saw fit t-o

sue for only part of their claim, namely, for only 5, 22151461 acres there-'
of and, as they 1101-.’ claim, they predi ated their claim =pon clause (3) of
‘He said in the Osage case (l Ind. Cls.
than one cate

.:, poss:.cl;r he cased upon more

sane ease, 3.19 C. Cls. S92,

to the same ef.=‘.‘_ect. So the Chic‘:-casaw could have based their claim. on
both clauses and they evidentl3r thoug1-t they had, for we find in their
brief in the former case this statement: "However, if for the reasons
hereinafter set forth and discussed in detail the Commission does not
feel justified in sustaining this claim under Clause 3, then clearly it
would fall under Clause 3."

But, however, that may be, the Chickasaw obtained an award under
clause (3), so clause(5) has no application. Blackfeet et al..v. United
States,'lé7 C. Cls. 8C7, 818.

t must be concluded, therefore, that the claims now presented by
the Chickasaw for their interests in the lands allotted the Kiowa, Comanche
and Apache, those allotted the ‘.~£"chita and those reserved for school purposes, etc. were fully adjudicated in the former case, Docket‘ No .. 23 (1 Ind.
Cls. Cor.-:::. 291-332, 356-357) and the judgment of July lb, l9SO, is res

In the pending claim the C'.'1j.C7.:CE‘.-.‘.L.-‘-“".-‘.7 include 95,999 acres of lands in
the Leased District, which were allotted to the Cheyenne and Arapaho out
of the 2,l=.59,lS9 acres set aside for those two t&'bes for which the defendant paid the Choctaw'ar.-:1 Chic‘.2:as"'r thesum of $2,991, 1150 by the Act

It is beyond doubt that the Choctaw and Chickasaw had a claim tor

the entire Leased District, the 7,713,620 acres, and that it arose from

the cession of it they made by the Treaty of.April 28, 1866, lb Stat.

759. That cession was for the entire tract and it was the tract as a

whole the defendant acouired by that treaty.

The fact that subsequent
to the treaty the defendant divided the district among other tribes did

not change the Choctaw or Chickasaw claim, for the claim remained the

same as it was on.April 28, l866, a single and indivisible claim for the

entire district. Of course, neither the Choctaw nor Chickasaw were

.As we have said before and as we found in the former case (Finding

3-_.=_5_,__ v_ U_L-;_~*;,ed stages, 95 U, 3, 530, also illustrates the principle.
Baird had a claim against the C-overrment grow_'.ng out of a contract for the
manufacture of steam engines for which he sued and obtained judgment for

part of his claim. in the Court of Claims. Later a second suit was brought

for the residue of the claim but it was denied by the Court of Claims.

 

On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed, stating the law to be:

41- 6!: 4? It is well settled that, where a party brings an
action for a part or._"Ly' of an entire indivisible demand, :1
recovers judgment, he cannot subsequently maintain an action
for another part of the sane demand. Warren v. Comings,

6 Cush. 103. Thus, if there are several sums due under one
contract, and a suit is bmught for a part orJ.-3:, a judgment

in ‘«'-hm"- sm"l"- vi"! 1 be a ‘bar to '-.=.no'i:her action for the r::::.'::.*:.':.:';,*
of.‘ the residue. Here was a contract by which the Government was
bound to pay for the engines in accordance with terms agreed
upon. The entire price to be paid was not fixed. A part was
contingent, and the amount made to depend upon a variety of
circumstances. 1-Jhen_the former action was ooznmenced in the
Court of Claims, the whole was due. although different elements entered into the account, they all depended upon and were
embraced in one contract. The judgment, therefore, for the part

then sued upon is a bar to this action for the "residue.“

The cases on the question are legion: l A... Jur. 1:80, sec. .96 and
cases cited; Baltimore etc. V’. Phillips, 271*. U. S. 3175 Cromwell V. Sac
