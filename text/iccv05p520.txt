1.-Jitt, Chief Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.

Petitioners herein, The San Juan Tribe of Indians, allege aboriginal possession of an area of approximately 120,000 acres of land. Said
land comprises the county of San Juan in the present State of ‘Rshingtor.
Petitioners further allege that they are a tribal organization recognized
by the Secretary‘ of the Interior and as such recognized group are entitled
to pursue this claim under Section 2 of the Indian Clams Commission .5-.ct

(50 Stat. 1oL9).

They are claiming ‘wages in the amount-Z-... J.‘ 94.‘ ‘ ‘ a- .4. J. ‘ """.L- 4" -I- .-.4.-.-. -._-."| ,,“"';'.:‘ “‘

with an a_.'*lotrr.ent of 80 acres of land, '.;h:1_ch they allege defendant should

have done because the course of.‘ dealing between various Indian tribes

defendant lead th Indians to so believe. The? cite the 6th Article

N

of the Treaty of.’ Omaha (l0 Stat. 1.01:3) of 1‘-Larch l6, l8SLL, which was cited
in Article 7 of the Point _.-lliott Treaty of January 22, 1855, as authority

for such belief. Petitioner cites the whole of Section 2 of the Act as

grounds of suit but appears to rely priuarilgr on Section 2(5).
..t the outset of this case and that of the Lsznmi Tribe,‘Doc1-:et No.
llO, petitioners moved the Commission to consolidate the two dockets

for the‘ purpose of tria_'L. This notion was granted and the cases were

evidence introduced was made applicable to both

cases and has ‘been coz;sidered in ‘that manner.

At the ‘conclusion of petitioner‘ s evidence, defendant moved the
Commission for a dismissal 3'.‘ the claim of the San Juan. Indians tased
upon the fact that the evidence showed that no such aboriginal enti'y'

as the San Juan Tribe existed and therefore could have no descendants

or successors in interest with a right to prosecute a claim (Tr; pp. 280282);

the San Juan Indians can recover. You cannot assert a claim

for that which never existed. Under the circumstances which did exist,

as shown.by the evidence, it is apparen that the San Juan Indians are

asserting not one, but at least tso different clahns under the Indian
Claims Commission.Act. These are claims which most probab_y should

be asserted by the Lummi Tribe and the Sanish Tribe.‘ That is exactly
wast is being done in this instance. The Lunni have a claim in Docket

a party:

%-a %~Hosever, if we are not correct, the record does dis»
close such a pretonderant doubt as to tribal status of these
Indians that we would be unable to ii. that they constituted
what was known as a separate and distinc

t lndian trioe, but
acquired a name due more to location 5 their villages upon the
San Juan islands, in association with other tribes of the same
locality, and it is not disputed that the San Juan Islands were

case was sufficient to convince this Commission of the merit of

claim to the islands of Lummi, Orcas, and Shaw. At the same time that

evidence, which "was also a part of this case failed to show any indication of an aboriginal entity on the San Juan Islands which was known
San Juan

as the San Juan Tribe of Indians. ‘We have no doubt that the

Indians are for the most part the descendants of Indians who lived.in
the area aboriginally. There is no affirmative proof as to which of
the several groups they may have belonged to and it is quite possible

that some of the present San Juan Indians are descendants of tribes that

lived on the Canadian side of the Puget Sound at the time the Treaty of

Q t

Po_nt negotiated on uanuary

233 i855 [12 Stat. 92?).\

It is the opinion of this Commission that petitioners have failed

to establish that they are the descendants and successors in interest

of a tribe or group which existed at the time of the negotiation of the
Point Elliott Treaty of January 22, l8SS, anriwhich had used and occupied
a de.f.’.nable area of land from tine immaterial until that date. See the

Suiattle-Sack ?ribe of Indians vs. The United.State§£ 2 Ind. Cls. Comm.

Attention.is called to the fact that there is filed only one proposed
findings of fact in the consolidated cases, Dockets No. ll0 and.Eo. 2lh3

finoing- of fact (:lECL“g 21) it is recited that “Ina so-ca_;ee

San Juan grioe of Indians % % % is comocsed.of descendants of members
of the Lemmi Tribe, Samish Tribe and oerhaps other tribes;" and it is

stated in proposed findings 22 and 23 that the members of the San Juan

Tribe, who are descendants of the Lunni Tribe, etc. will be beneficiaries
of any award that mignt be made in Docket No. llO and that an3'members
of said San Juan Tribe, who are descendants of the Samish Tribe, etc.
will be beneficiaries of any award.that might be made in the case of
the Samish Tribe pending before the Commission under Docket No. 261.

It is understood that defendant does not care to file any further
pleadings in the case.

For the above reasons the motion made by defendant at trial herein
that the petition in Docket No. 21h be dismissed is granted and said
petition is hereby dismissedo

.A final order to that effect will be enteredo
