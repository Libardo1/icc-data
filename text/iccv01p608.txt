EINDINGS 03' FACT
The Commission makes the following findings of fact:

1. The Raw Tribe of Indians is an identifiable Indian tribe rcsiding within the territorial limits of the United States. but it does
not maintain a tribal organization. The plaintiff, Felix Macaulay. is
5. Raw Indian by blood and is authorized to maintain this action under
section 10 of the Indian Claims Commission Act.

2. The Eat: Indians. frequently designated as the Kansas Indi— _
ans,‘ are closely related to the Osage, Quapaw. Omaha and Ponca. all
of whom are of the Siouan Indian stock. According to tradition. these

Siouan Indians lived in prehistoric times along the Ohio River. down I

which they migrated until they reached the Mississippi. The group
which later became known as the Kansas or Kaw Indians moved up the
Mississippi to the Missouri River, until they finally reached the
mouth of the Kansas River. Near this point they established a
Village. In 1702, Iberville, a French explorer, estimated the

tribe as having 1,500 families. In 17214 Bourgont, the French
Governor of that area, found a large village of the Kansas or quans,
as he called them, on the Missouri at the mouth of Independence Greek,
near the present town of Doniphan, Doniphan County, Kansas. In 1801+,
according to Lewis and Clark, the Kan Indians were living in two vil-K
lages on the Kansas River, one about 20 leagues and the other about
 leagues from its mouth. A treaty of peace and friendship was made
with them by the United Stateson October 28, 1815 at St. Louise Ehey
were then living on the Kansas River at the mouth of the Saline River.
At that time they occupied 130 earth lodges and their nnizfmr was estimated at 1,500. O‘ Fallon estimatedt their number in 1822 at 1,850.
Their numbers were considerably reduced by l825. Their mmbers in '
19145 appear to be 53-31%. &

William E. Cozmelley, in his article, Early Indian Occupancy of

\

 ng, Voltage XIV, Kansas Historical Society, at page 1155,

tells of the hunting and roaming over of the Great Plains country by
various tribes of Indians, mentioning the Pavznees, the Padoucas

(Comanche-s), Caddoans (Wichitas and ?annees), and the Kansas:

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 608 U 610
.. 3 ..;.

This matter of a common right to hunt the buffalo
on the plains after they had been exterminated in the
country east of the Missouri River may never have been
conceded by the Oaddoans * * * to whom the country
evidently belonged; and the Kansas and Osage Siouans
may have asserted this right and may have sustained it
by might against the Caddoans. The same causes which
were driving the Siouans into Oaddoan territory from
K the Red river to the Upper Missouri may have weakened

the area of the Caddoans, rendering them incapable of
holding all their domain from this violation. One thing,
however, is certain. The Caddoans never relinquished
their claims .to all this Kansas country, except a narrow
margin along the Missouri. They continued to assert

their rights against the aggressions of the Kansas Indians down to l81¥2, when Fremont saw the nuins of a Kansas

town near the present Bellvue, then but recently burned
by the Pawnees. This was seventeen years after the
cession of that country by the Kansas to the United

States-when they probably sold much which they did
not own:

The town of.Be1lvue mentioned above is about midway between

“Topeka and Manhattan and is in the portion of the reservation of the
Kansas or Kaw Indians described in the treaty of 1825.,

Finding III in the case reported in 80 Ct. Cls. 269, is that
the plaintiff tribewas driven from‘ their villages on the Missouri

River by the Iowa and Sac, and at the time of the treaty of l825 the

tribe was living in two villages on the Kansas River.

The treaty of June .3], 1825 describes the land ceded as

follows:

Article 1. The Kansas do hereby cede to the
United States all the lands lying within the State of
Missouri, to which the said nation have title or claim;
and do further cede and relinquish, to the said United
States, all other lands which. they new occupy, or to
which they have title or claim, lying West of the said

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 608 _ 611

..4 _

State of Missouri. and within the following boundaries;
beginning at the entrance of the Kansas river into the
Missouri river; from thence North to the North-West

corner of the State of Missouri; from thence Westwardly
to the Nodewa river. thirty miles from its entrance into
the Missouri; from thence to the entrance of the Big

Hemahaw river into the Missouri, and with that river to

its source; from thence to the source of the Kansas river.
leaving the old village of the Pania Republic to the West;

from thence, on the ridge dividing the waters of the Kansas
river from those of the Arkansas, to the Western boundary

of the State line of Missouri. and with that line, thirty
miles, to the place of beginning.

There is nothing in the record to show that the cession was at any
time completely surveyed.

The lands included in the Eaw treaty of 1825 situated in Missouri
and Iowa were included in the lands ceded by the treaty of July 15.
1.830, in which the Secs and Fares, four bands of the Sioux, the Omaha.
and Iowa. Otoes and Missourian were all included as grantors.

All lands south of the Platte River within the area described in
the Kaw treaty of 1825 were coded by the Pawnees to the United States
by treaty of October 9. 1833.

Quitclaims to lands located between the west line of the State
of Missouri as then fixed. and the Missouri River were executed by
the following bands and tribes: on September 10. 1836 by the tfa-haBhaws tribe of Sioux; on September 17. 1836 by the Iowa tribe and

the band of the Sacs and Foxes of the I-iissom-j‘,_ (residing west of the

State of Missouri). The terms and wording of this last treaty seem to

indicate that the Indians with whom it was made were living on the lands

1 Ind. Cl. Com. 608 J _ . 612

-5lying between the Missouri State line and the Missouri hiver.
There is no evidence to show when they had settled there. On
September 827. 1836 the Sauk and Fox executed a quitclaim of any
interest in the land between the State of Missouri and the Missouri.
River; and on October 15. 1836 the Otoes. Missourian. Omhas and
the Yankton and Santee bands of Sioux executed a quitclaim to the’
same lands. Said land-«as also included in the cession of October 30, 1836 by the Wahpaakootah. Susseton and Upper Medawakanton
tribes of Sioux Indians.

The only part of the ceded territory described in the treaty
of June 3, 1825 occupied and possessed at the time by the Kaw Indians was a comparatively small undefined area located near the present
town of Manhattan. Kansas in the central part of the cession. within
the area reserved by the treaty. The balance of the ceded area was
wandered over and hunted upon by the Kaw Indians and other Indian
tribes. and no one tribe had the exclusive occupancy or possession
thereof. 8

3. In negotiating and making the treaty of June 3. 1825 the

- United States did not recognize or‘°a_cknowledge the exclusitre use and

occupancy right or title of the Kaw tribe of Indians in any of the
lands ceded under said treaty.

'4. The treaty of June 3. 1825 provided for a reservation in

the following language. to wit:

Article 2. From the cession aforesaid, the following
reservation for the use of the Kansas nation of Indians
shall be made. of a tract of land. to begin twenty leagues
up the Kansas river, and to include their village on that
river; extending West thirty miles in width. through the

i Ind. C1. Comm. 608 513
-6...

lands ceded in the first Article (referring to the area den}

scribed in Article 1), to be surveyed and marked under the

direction of the President, and to such extent as he may deem
necessary, and at the expense ofuthe United States. '5 *3‘ '°'

The lands embraced within the boundaries of the reservation
created for the use and occupancy of the Raw Indians by the aforesaid treaty as just described comprised 6,559,0’40 acresa

’ 5.“ Two million acres off the east end of the Ear: reservation
(as provided by the treaty of 1825) was ceded to the United States
by Article 1 of the treaty of January 114, 18146 for the consideration
of $202,000.

6. By Article 5 of the treaty of January 11:, 18% it was provided that after the west line of the 29000,00O acres ceded by Article 1

of the treaty had been determined, the President of the United States.
was authorized, if there was not a sufficiency of timber on the remaining portion of the reservation, to canse to be selected and laid off
for the tribe another body of land for the tribe, in which event the
remainder of the reservation would thereby becomta the property of the
United States. Under the authority of eats provision, a reservation

of lands known as the Council Grove reservation, consisting of

. 25598:’?-!~.149 acres near the eastern boundary of the original reservation,

was provided for said tribe, and thereby there was acquired by the
United States the remaining portion of said original reservation, which
said remaining portion comprised 1-3-,,559,01%0 acrese

7. The value of the 2,000,000 acres off the east end of the

original. reservation was, at the time of its cession, to wit,

1 Ind. Cl. Comm. 608 , 614
1 7 1

January lM,.l8h6, to the United States, 50¢ per acre, or a total of
$1,000,000.00.

S._ The value ofthe 14,559,030 acres acquired by the United
States under the terns of Article 5 of the treaty of January lh, l8U6,
was, at ‘the time of its cession, }40¢ per acre, or a total of

$1,823,616.00.

9. {the value of the council Grove Reservation, 255,853-LJL9 acres,
provided for the Indians in lieu of the 1L,559,O1l0 acres acquired by the

United states, was, at the time of its cession to the Kaws, 50¢ per

acre, or a total of $127,927.25.

10. The consideration received by the Kaws for the 2,000,000 acres,

and the consideration. received for the 1L,559,O3+0 acres, was in each instance so grossly inadequate as to constitute an unconscionable considerat ion.

11. By Section 12 of the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat.
61+o) it was provided that a. Commission be created for the investigation,
consideration and settlement of claims of the Kansas or Raw tribe of

Indians against the United States, said section 12 providing in part

as follows:

Sec. 12. All claims, of whatever nature, which said
Kansas or Kat: tribe of Indians may have or claim to have
against the United States shall be submitted to a commission to be appointed by the Secretary of the Interior
from the officers or employees of his Department for investigation, consideration, and settlement; and the United
States shall, without delay, render to said tribe of Indians a complete accounting of all moneys agreed to be paid
to said tribe to which said tribe may be entitled wider
any treaty or Act of Congress. If the settlement of the

3. Ind. c1. Comm. 608 , _ ‘615

-3...

claims of said tribe, submitted to said commission (and

the accounting) is satisfactory to said tribe, the amount
found due shall be placed to the credit of the members of
said tribe, according to the terms of this agreement, within
one year after the report of said commission is made, '°' '9'.‘
(Under so or ing supplied.)

The Ear Commission thereafter appointed, and acting under and
by virtue of the above Act of Congress, made an award to the said

Indians in the amount of $155,976.38 in satisfaction of specific
claims and denied any award on the tribe‘ s claim for reservation

lands .

Thereafter, on March 3, 1905 Congress passed an Act (33 Stat.

l01$8', 1079) appropriating $155,976.58, using the following language,

+05 «I-n-3‘.
U1! Ii...|.\'

:2

SEC, 7. For payment to the Kansas or Kan Indians
in settlement of their claims against the United States,
as established by the award of the Kavrcommission, under
the provisions of -the Act of Congress of July first,
nineteen hundred and two (Thirty-second Statutes at Large,
page six hundred and thirty-six), one hundred and fiftyfive thousand nine hundred and seventy-six dollars and
eighty-eight cents, to be immediately available: Provided,
That the amount herein appropriated is accepted by the '
said Kansas or Kan Indians in full. settlement for all
claims of whatever nature which they may have or claim
to have against the United States: 9 “‘ '5’ rovided hov.-‘ever,
That no part of said sum shall be paid until said Indians,
in general council lavrfullggr convened for that purpose, shall
execute and deliver to the United States a general release

of all claims and demands of every name and nature against
the United States:: ‘J *3 '9

 

Thereafter, on April 22, 1905 the Kev: Indians assembled in
general council and voted to accept the appropriation and to
execute the release required by the act of March 3, 1905 and did

execute an instrument of release providing in part as follows:

616
1 Ind. Cl. Comm. 688

-9How Therefore We, the undersigned, constituting a majority
of the male adults of said Kansas or Kaw tribe of Indians,
for ourselves and for the Kansas or Kan tribe, do by these
presents hereby release and relinquish to the United State
all claims and demands of every name and nature against the
United States, this release being in consideration of the
payment to said tribe of the sum of $155,976.88 subject to
the conditions mentioned in said act of March 3, 1905, to
be paid and disbursed in accordance with the provisions of

the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat. 636),"

This release is urged by the defendant as fully releasing and
discharging the claims sued on herein.

The claim of the Indians (which claim, however, was not formally
submitted to said Commission) for the lands of its reservation in
excess of the 2,000,000 acres definitely ceded by Article 1 of the
treaty of 1886, are found by finding Ho, 6 herein to be the amount
of 4,559,040 acres, and by finding E0. 8 to have a value of 1+0?! per
acre, or a total value of $1,823,616.00, I

The only consideration for the release above referred to was the
payment of the sum of $155,976.88 which had been appropriated by said
Act of March 3, 1905. to settle said award of the Kaw Commission in
said amount and in full settlement of all claims. including that under
consideration here, which the Kansas or Kan Indians had against the
United States; that the amount so paid for such release was so grossly

inadequate as to constitute an unconscionable consideration.
