UNITED snvrns,

Defendant.
Decided: June lh, 1960

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS 93 FACT,
_The Commission makes the following findings of fact which are
supplemental to the amended findings numbered 1 through L8 heretofore

made herein.

Claims I and II.Area
E9. ‘The tract referred.to as the Claims I and II area, which
the Commission has hereinbefore determined was held by petitioner under
original Indian title, is described in Finding of Feet No. 30. By a
stipulation, filed with this Commission on October 20, 1958, the
parties have agreed that the Claims I and II area contains l3,07h,OOO
acres. This tract is to be valued as of October 9, 1833, the date of
the treaty by which the Indians ceded the lands to the United States.
50. The tract is located south of the Platte River and includes

5:563,hOO acres in south central Nebraska and h,5OS,6OO acres in north

central Kansas. The Platte River forms the northern boundary. The

6&8

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 6&9

east boundary lies about 50 miles west of the Missouri River. The
tract is about 200 miles wide from east to west and about 90 miles
long from north to south.

S1. The topography of the land is generally level to rolling
with elevations of about l2OO feet at the southeasterly corner to
approximately 3000 feet at the northwesterly edge near North Platte,
Nebraska. The eastern section is characterized as undulating to gently
rolling upland. The central area is generally a level, plains region
while the western portion is characterized by rough, broken lands.

52. The land is watered by five principal rivers. The Platte
River, flowing generally from west to east, forms the northern boundary
of the tract. The Republican River, flowing from west to east, approximately bisects the western and central portions of the area and then
turns southeasterly leaving the tract at the southeast corner. The
Solomon River and its forks water the extreme southwestern and south
central portion of the area. The Big Blue River flows generally north
to south in the northeastern part of the tract while to the south and
west the Little Blue River flows southeasterly through the central
portion of the eastern third of the tract above the Republican River.

53. The average annual precipitation varies from 28 inches on
the east to 20 inches on the west boundary. The warm season rainfall
(the rainfall from.April through September) varies from 22 inches on
the east to 16 inches on the nest. However, the area, especially the
“9Stern portion, is subject to periods of drought when hot, dry winds
Cause serious and extensive damage to crops. During the growing season,

which ranges from l6O to 170 days, temperatures are very favorable to

°r0P growth.

Sh. Most of the timber in the tract was located along the rivers,
creeks and other water courses. ‘While there was no timber of any comnercial value, its presence was a necessity for the early settlers to
provide fuel, building material, fences, and protection from the weather.

The surveyors’ comments listed 225 of the 6lO townships as possessing

choice or medium amounts of timber. There was a small amount in another
197 townships -while 137 townships had none or scanty amounts of timber.
Of.the 137 townships with none or poor timber, ll8 were in the Nebraska
portion of the tract with timber especially short in the central and
western portions of the area. .

55.‘ There was an adequate supply of water in approximately twothirds of the townships.‘ The best watered townships were in the Kansas
portion of the tract with poor water supply in the Nebraska area,

especially in the central and western portions.

56. .A.number of the townships had limestone which was used as a

building material, especially where timber was lacking. The surveyors

"reported abundant quantities of stone in 93 townships, mostly in the

Kansas portion of the tract.

' " There were references to mill sites in several townships in the
area. There were salt springs in the tract and there was evidence of

some minerals, although none of any commercial value.

5?. In 1833, and before, various government officials and explorers.

described, in general terms, portions of the Pawnee lands. In l80h the
Lewis and Clark expedition reported the area to be a country of open
plains interspersed with groves of timber along the water courses and

fertile, well watered land. Isaac McCoy reported on his 1828 exploration

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 658 651

describing a portion of the area as generally high, rolling country with

fertile soil along the rivers. He reported no scarcity of water but

Fnoted that the small amount of timber was the greatest defect.

S8. Petitioner‘s expert appraisers, E. B. Horton, Jr., and T. C.

-Hitchings, Jr., classified the land as follows:—

Bottom land or first rate l,?S8,hS3 acres l3.hS%

Uplands or second rate 8,900,??? acres 68,08%

Steep, rocky, hilly, sandy ,
river wash, or third rate 2,hlh,768 acres l8.h7%

59. Defendant‘s expert appraiser, William G. Murray, has tabulated

the original surveyors‘ description of the section by section surveys

iof each township in the tract. Of the 610 townships in the Claims I

and II area, 20 townships were reported to have large areas of bottom

land while 35 had a fair amount or some and hl had little bottom land.

The surveyors’ descriptions as to the quality of the bottom lands indicate that they were mostly excellent or lst rate.
The surveyors‘ comments as to the quality of the upland soil rated
L9 townships as lst rate; 55 townships as a combination of lst and 2nd

rate; 285 townships as 2nd rate; 69 townships as 2nd and 3rd rate; and

90 townships as 3rd rate, This leawes only 62 of the 610 townships

with no information. The surveyors"descriptions of the quality of the
upland soil indicates it was roughly average or 2nd rate.

60. The bottom lands were principally along the rivers and
streams in the area. Most of the lst rate upland soil was in the

eastern and central parts of the area with the poor 3rd rate soil in

the western part.

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 . / 652

61. The Missouri River was navigable and would have provided
transportation to a point about 50 miles east of the Claims I and II
area. However, there were no navigable rivers within the subject tract.

The Oregon Trail was the principal means of transportation in the

area. One branch of the trail started at I-Iestport (Kansas City), Kansas,

I and followed the Santa Fe Trail west of Olathe, Kansas, where it branched

north, leaving the Santa Fe Trail, crossing the Kansas River near Topeka

and going north to cross the Blue River near St. I-1ary's, Kansas. From

St. Mary's the Oregon Trail entered the Pawnee lands near the present

Kansas-I-l*Jebraskai border in the southwest corner of Gage County, Nebraska.

‘I I

i The trail then ‘continued northwest to Fort Kearney on the Platte River.

The ‘second branch of the ‘Oregon Trail commenced at Fort Leavenworth
or St. Josephand joined the first described branch near the Blue River
in Kansas, not far iron what is now St. l~‘.ary's. The Oregon Trail gave
the Pawnee area a wagon trail connection with the Missouri. River. While
not itself navigable, the Platte 7.River valley provided an attractive
wagon route. W — "' I i c H

In 18333 railroads were in their infancy on the east coast, 
no consideration has been given to the prospect of their development
in the west. as bearing on the market value of the Claims I and II
area. i it I K it i

62. (a) Based on the government surveys of the townships in the
tract, which surveys were made between 1857 and 18714, petitioner’s
expert appraisers have concluded that about 75% of the tract was suitable

for cultivation and about 25% was suitable for grazing.

8 Ind. Cl. Com,  

{b} Using the care information recorded in the original survey
notes, defendantis expert appraiser concluded that the highest and
best use was farming in the eastern two~thirds of the area and grazing
in the western one—third.

63. The portion suitable for cultivation would have been used for
subsistence farming. In l833 there were no markets to which agricultural
products could hare been profitably shipped from the Claims I and II
area.

6h. The Commission finds that the evidence does not support the
conclusions of etitioneris experts as to the quantity of land suitablet
in l833 for farndng. Petitioner's expert,.Mr. Horton, testified that
the original surveyors‘ notes relative to land suitable for cultivation
and that suitable for grazing had been indicated by townships on a map
of the area of Claims I and II (Pet. Ex. 173). From his interpretation
of the surveyors’ notes as indicated on that map, Hr. Horton found
approximately 75% of the townships to have been suitable for cultivation.
However, many townships indicated thereon as having a best use fort
cultivation appear not to be so suited from the corments made in the
original survey notes. The following townships categorized by petitioner as cultivable were described by the original surveyors as
follows:

Q?

133, RhE (srrveyed in lB§?}
This township is nearly all gcntl“

_ 3 rolling prairie entire 3
destitute of water excepting Ih small creek in the northern
part which is dry during the fr; season. There is a small
quantity of timber scattered along the creek of medium
quality, consisting principally of oak, elm, and black xalnut.
?.e soil is good but too dry to be useful for agriculzuril

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6h8 I ~- ~- » 65h

TISN. RlE (surveyed in 1858)

The land in this township is level, high and dry. Mostly of
a third-rate quality. _There is no timber in the township;
consequently the land is not well adapted to cultivation.

ThN, R28W (surveyed 1871)

The quality of the land in this township, as a rule is about
second-rate, soil being six to eight inches deep. The greatest
objection to the high lands is the scarcity of water or means
of irrigation which renders it very nearly worthless for agricultural purposes, as the only way of getting water sufficient
for the purposes would be by windmill pump and deep wells ....

(TEN, Rllw (surveyed 1860)

(The soil in this township in the east portion is equal to
the average; in the west portion sandy. The uplands are
rolling and gentle, as good soil as the bottoms, but as they
cannot be irrigated will provably never be cultivated ....'

TSN, Rl2W (surveyed 1859 and 1867)

This township is third rate soil and sand hills, except along
the Little Blue River, which is second rate. There is but
very little timber on the river. will not'admit of settlement
and should not be sub-divided .... ' '

TSN, Rl7N (surveyed 186?)
The land in this township is poor, second-rate land and is not
well adapted to farming purposes ....

rsn, R2lW (surveyed 1869)
. The surface of this township is rolling and hilly soil, mostly
"third-rate and oi poor quality for agricultural purposes ....

T7N, Rldw (surveyed 1859)

This township consists of level or gently rolling upland prairie

with a soil averaging from second to third-rate. It is without
I timber or water and consequently will not admit of settlement.

The Commission finds that approximately two-thirds of the subject
tract, generally the eastern two-thirds, had a highest and best use for

cultivation and approximately.one~third, generally the western onethird, had a highest and best use for grazinv.
65. The history of the settlement of Kansas and Nebraska indicates that the early settlers followed the rivers where they sought woodede

areas, the alluvial soil of their valleys, and water. As shown by the

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 655

original survey notes settlement was generally restricted to areas along
the Platte Riser and along the Big and Little Blue Rivers. Even as late
as the 1860's and early 1870's there was little settlement in the western
portion of the élaims I and II area. I

Ihe-first census in Nebraska was taken November 20, 135b, at‘wh1ch
time there were é,832 persons. By 1855 the bopulation was h,h9h with
settlement generally restricted to the southeast corner of Nebraska and.
for a short distance along the Platte River. In 1856 only the easternmost Nebraska counties in the Claims I and II area had been organized.
Br 18oO the counties south of the Platte, in Nebraska, had been formed,but they were virtually unpopulated. The 1860 census figures for the
counties were (from west to east):

(1812) and Missouri (1821). In 1833 Iowa did not exist as a territory

or a state. Iowa became a part of Michigan Territory in 1836 and was

organized by itself as a_territory in 1838.

River, westward along the Missouri River and then overland into the

Pawnee area.

68, The cession date, 1833, was a year of prosperity until fall
when there was a recession. The United States population continued its
steady increase, commodity prices were generally stable, farm prices
.era good and the cost of living was slightly less tan in the preceding
years; Government finances were unusually favorable for debt retirement.

69. Short term.interest rates were about 10% while long term.rates
in the 1825-1833 period for state and federal loans were in the us: to
8% range. A reasonable interest rate to attract the capital required
for a purchase of the Claims I and II area in 1833 would have been
about 8%.

70. Any prospective purchaser of the 13,07h,00 acre Claims I

and.II area would have considered the other lands available on the
market in 1833. There was in northwest Missouri, north of the Missouri

River, some h35,h3h acres which had been placed on the market in 1821.

71. In l82b there was agitation to reduce the price of public lands
and a bill to carry out this desire was introduced in l82h by Senator
Thomas H. Benton of Missouri. On December 27, 1827, the Commissioner
of the General Land Office, in response to a request of the Senate,
submitted a detailed report on the quantity and quality of unsold public

land, including the estimates of value by the local Registers and Receivers

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 659
The three states nearest the Claims I and II area ~- Hicsouri, Arkansas,
and Illinois ~- had almost one~half of all the unsold public lands in

the United States in lB23. The reports of those states were: (Def. Ex.

Arkansas i 5,hh2,22S 1 out o§ 2 3-5¢
Illinois 13,195,000 5 out of 6 l2.S¢ to $1.00

The question of reducing the price of public lands remined an

issue, particularly in 1832 and 1833.

. 72. Petitioner has presented several categories of sales data

.nhich are urged as comparable sales.

(a) Sales to Emigrant Indian Tribes
Petitioner has tabulated what is referred to as sales of large

tracts by the government to certain emigrant Indian tribes. The transactidns referred to were not in fact sales but rather represented reserves, west of the Mississippi granted to eastern Indian tribes in
exchange for or in partial consideration for the cessions of their lands
east of the Mississippi. Petitioner's Exhibit No. 38 is a table, prepared in l8h0 by Henry R. Schoolcraft, listing tribes who had ceded
territory since the establishment of the federal government. In tabu§
lating the information Mr. Schoolcraft listed "No. of acres given in
exchange or reserved" and "Value of land given in exchange or reserved,
at $1.25 per acre.“ The $1.25 per acre figure was the government‘s
minimum statutory price for public lands. That figare was not used by’

Schoolcraft as the market value of the lands reserved. He used the

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 660

figure $0.625 per acre for the Cherokee reservation since that figure
was specifically set in the treaty (7 Stat. h78, Article 2). For all
others he used the statutory price for land without regard for its
location or the date involved or any other factors which would have
affected the value of land. The Commission has given no weight to this
evidence in determining the value of the Claims I and II area in 1833. The Commission has noted the Agreement with the Delawares and

.Wyandot, dated December lb, 18b3, (9 Stat. 33?) whereby the Delawares
ceded, granted and quitclaimed to the Wyandot Nation some 2h,960 acres
for a consideration of $b6,080.00 or $l.8b per acre. The consideration
was to be paid $6,080.00 in l8hh and $h,000.00 annually for the next

ten years. There was no provision for payment of interest on they
$h0,000.00 to be paid over a l0-year period. ‘The tract involved was
located some lh0 miles east of the southeast corner of the subject area
and was at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the'present

location of Kansas City, Kansas.

(b) Indian Trust Land Sales

 

r¢reaties were made with the Delaware (May 5, 185b, 10 Stat.
10h8j; Iowa (May I7, 185k, 10 Stat. l069)$ and Peoria (May'30, 185b,
10 Stat. I082) whereby certain lands were ceded to the United States in
trust to be sold for the benefit of the respective tribes.

The Delaware trust lands of some S60,8b0 acres were located
in northeastern Kansas and included substantial portions of Leavenworth
and Jefferson Counties.

A portion of the area to the east bordered the

Missouri River and on the south it bordered on the Kansas River.

I’

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 61:8 - 661

The Iowa trust lands comprised 95,§97 acres located in the
northeast corner of Kansas and a small area in southeast Nebraska with
the eastern portion in Kansas bordering the Missouri River.

The Peoria trust lands consisted of 208,585 acres located in
eastern Kansas along the Kansas-Missouri border.

By Act of March 3, 1855 (10 Stat. 700), Congress provided for
surveys of the ceded Indian lands in Kansas and authorized the President
to offer the trust lands at public sale after they had been classified

and appraised to his satisfaction. It was also provided that, for a

period of three years, none of the lands should be sold for less than

— $1.25 per acre. In a letter of instructions to the three commissioners

appointed to classify and appraise the lands, Commssioner Manypenny

- wrote, on April 16, 1856:

'"In classifying and appraising the trust lands . .,.
if upon personal view of the territory in which they
respectively lie you be of the opinion that portions of
the lands are less in value than $1.25 per acre, you.will

I not place a value on such lands. I .

“In fixing a valuation you will regard the eligibility
.and quality of the lands, the proximity of the same to the
JMissouri or the Kansas River, or other water courses, to
timber, to great leading roads, or other advantages, and
their position with reference to eligible town or city
sites, and those will all be taken into view and with any
other causes which in your opinion will add value to these
lands, will be made an eliment in fixing the price per acre
at which you will appraise them. They will be appraised
without any reference to the improvements which may have
been made upon them but while these are left out of view,
.the improvements which have been made upon adjacent lands
other than trust lands within the Territory of Kansas, so
far as the same may add value to the trust lands, you should
give due weight thereto, and allow this eliment of value
to have its fair influence on your judgement. The sites
-of the various cities and towns which have sprang upon these
lands, will be valued as town lots, having in view in such
valuation the eligibility and prominence of the site, but
leaving out of view the improvements upon such lots . . ."
(Pet. Ex. 213, pp. 2&0, Zhl)

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6h8 .. 662

The trust lands were appraised in l8Sé, generally in quarter section
tracts (160 acres) and in a few instances in fractional quarter sections.
The eastern half of the Delaware lands was appraised first followed by
the Iowa, Peoria and western half of the Delaware tract.

Following the sales of the eastern Delaware trust lands Commissioner

Manypenny, on January 3, l8S7, wrote the appraisal commissioners that

0 the appraisements of the western Delaware, Iowa, and Peoria lands were

not satisfactory to the President and that, from the evidence of the»
value of that country as disclosed by the eastern Delaware sales, there

was a necessity for increasing the appraisal rates. As a consequence

“"o£'those instructions the Peoria and Iowa appraisals were increased

2S'cents-per‘acre-in each classification and the western Delaware lands
were valued in some instances 25 cents or 50 cents per acre higher and
in som cases the original figures were not changed.

The appraisal figures, as revised, by classification were;

8 Ind, Cl. Com. 6h8 663

The eastern Delaware trust lands were sold between November, 1856,
and February, 1857, while the western Delaware trust lands were sold
between July and August, 1857. Total receipts from the sales were
$1,058,983.71, an average price (based on 560,8hO acres) of $1.88 per
acre.

The Iowa trust land sales were held in June, 1857, and 78,602.16
acres were sold for $l8b,b37.85, an average of $2.35 per acre.

~The Peoria trust land sales were held in June and July, 1857, and
207,758.85 acres were sold for $3h6,67l.O9, an average of $1.67 per acre.

The average prices per acre are not entirely indicative of the

price which some of the lands would have brought on the open market.

For bona fide settlers who had made "lasting and valuable improvements"

the appraisals were to be ccnsidered_the fair value of the land. Much

:of the land was acquired by settlers, many of whom.were land speculators,

for the appraised price and resold at a profit.

(c) Railroad Sales

 

"The Union Pacific Railroad, which had been chartered in 1862,

received land grants along the Platte River valley and twenty miles on

each side of it. From 1869 through 1879 the company's land sales were:

(d) Private Sales

Petitioner has presented a compilation of the earliest deed
records of each of the counties in both Kansas and Nebraska allegedly
comprising the area involved in all claims, with the exception of a
few counties which would not permit their records to be microfilmed.
Petitioner has stated that the compilation excluded platted land and

town lots and fiduciary or family transfers.

The listed sales included transactions involving very small
tracts. In Merrick County, Nebraska, there is a sale recorded in 1873
of 0.3 of an acre for a consideration of $bO or a rate of $133.33 an
acre. That sale in section 10 of T 13 N., R O6'E. appears to be in
Central City, Nebrasga, on the Cnion Pacific Railroad line.

‘ The earliest recorded sale was in 185?, 2b years after the
date of valuation for the Claims I and II,area3'uhile the latest sale
in the tabulation was in 188b, 51 years after the date of valuation.

It is also obvious that multiple sales of the same property
were also included in the compilation. For example in the Adams County,
Nebraska; sales the following transactions were included involving one

covering a period from 1858 through 1887 only ZPSQ acres were within
the area to be valued and that entire acreage ias in one township

(L N-, Range 5 E). There were no listed sales in the other 2 full townships and 3 partial townships within the Claims rand IL area.

Township h North, Range 5 East was surveyed in 1858 at which time

it was described:

The other two full townships in the Claims I and II area were described by the surveyor as possessing mostly third rate land and no sales
are listed for those townships (T.-SN., R. SE. and T..6N.,.R. SE.)

At the extreme eastern border of Saunders County, Nebraska, about
25 miles east of the eastern edge of the Claims I and II area, the
following sales are recorded in section 29 of T. lhN., R. l0E.:

1867 2 acres 8$80.00 $h0/acre

1867 2 acres 80.00 b0/acre

186? 2 acres 100.00 S0/acre
1868 1 acre 50.00 S0/acre

This section bordered on the Platte River.

Two other sales in Saunders County, recorded in 1869, involved

land in section 2, T. l2 N., R. 09E. One sale was 100 acres for

”"$h,000.00, the other 7§.h acres for $3,000.00, or $h0.00 per acre.

This land was over 20 mles east of the subject area at the site of the
present town of Ashland, Nebraska. I
i. In Saline County, Nebraska, in the eastern portion of the Claims I
and II area, all 16 townships were categorized by petitioner as having a
highest and best use for cultivation. ‘we have examined in detail the
sales in one of those townships (T. 07 K., R. 03 Eo)1' That township was
surveyed in 1857 with this description:
"The quality of the land in this Township is very good.
The upland is high, and generally gently rolling, good 2d
class soil. The bottom land is first rate soil sufficiently

nixed with sand to make it pleasant to cultivate. The North
Fork of Turkey Creek is a beautiful stream of clear water,

and walnut.’
Petitioner has listed 22 sales in that ow;:n_; during the period
from 1866 through l870. Those sales totaled ll8O acres or an average
of 53.6 acres per sale. There was one sale of 170 acres and h sales
of 160 acres, with 12 sales of 10 acres or less. The average price per
acre for the sales was $7.57. All of the sales in this township were

in the nine sections watered by Turkey Creek av; .acluding the bottom

lands. There were no sales recorded for the remaining 27 sections which

-contained the high upland with "good second cla-: soil.”

An examination of the.privaue sales data for Furnas County,
Nebraska, reveals the following pattern for the land market in the
western portion of the Claims I and II area. Petitioner's experts
have categorized 7% townships in Furnas County as having a highest and
best use for cultivation, with 9 3/h townships suitable for grazing and
3 townships with no data (based on the original surveyors‘ notes).

The sales data covers the years l873 thrcrah L676, involving

§

»8,S82.6 acres at an average of $3.95 per acre.‘ ine largest sale was
hhl.3 acres but most sales were for 160 acres or less with several sales
of 5 acres. ‘With practically no exceptions all sales were immediately
adjacent to the Republican River or Beaver and Sappa Greeks. The
greatest number of sales occurred in Township h N., Range 23 E., along
the Republican River. This township had been surveyed in October 1870
at which time the surveyor noted that the "surface of this township is
generally rolling, but level in the bottom land of the Republican River.

The soil in the upland is fair quality; in the bottom land it is good

and well adapted to agricultural purposes.” The listed private sales
in this township accounted for 2,733.9 acres or 32% of all Furnas
County‘s tabulated sales. and a total of 1736.1 acres were in three

sections of the township, sections lb, 22, and 23, which were adjoining

sections on the Republican River. The sales in just these three sections

. accounted for_20% of all the tabulated sales in the entire county of

20 townships,(720 sections).

- There were sales totaling 1,905.9 acres in the next township to

_the-east, T. L N., R. 23 E., also watered by the Republican River. Those

sales represented 22% of all petitioner’s recorded sales in Furnas
County; There were also a number of sales about Beaver Creek at the
present site of Beaver Citv and a smaller number of sales scattered
along Sappa Creek. There were no recorded sales in the vast areas

away from.the streams. There were six townships with no listed sales,
four townships with but one sale and one township with a total of three
sales.

The northwest corner of'the Claims I and II area is in a part of the

present day Iincoln County, Nebraska. iOn its “indicated best use_map"

_(Pet. Ex. 173) petitioner described all of the subject area within_Lincoln

‘County as suitable for grazing. In the tabulation of private sales for

-Iincoln County there are sales between 1871 and 1876 totaling 3,665.9

acres at an average per acre price of $h.h6. However, all but three
sales are actually outside the subject area about the present day city
of North Platte, Nebraska. The three sales within the Claims I and II
area are on the Platte River. There are no indicated sales in the

grazing land area south of the river.

lands in Nebraska and Kansas. bsing various sets fl
figures, petitioner has formulated a trend which is then extended
backward to the 1833 cession date arriving at a "trend value of the
lands within Claims I and II at the cession date“ of $2.85 per acre..
This procedure is, in essence, the method employed by petitioner's expert economist, Mr. John R. Houser. The Commission has already excluded
Mr} Houser's report from evidence in this case (see order sustaining defendant*s objections to the admission of petitioner‘s exhibits 22h, 225
,and 226 and denying petitioner's motion to strike, dated June 26,.l9S9,
and Commission's opinion of the same date).. The Commission finds the
census value evidence submitted by petitioner to be of little value in
;determining market value of the subject area in 1833.
7h. The 1833 treaty of cession was made for the purpose of ac_quiring lands west of the Mississippi River to relocate emigrant tribes
from east of the Mississippi. The treaty itself provided that the ceded
iarea (Claims I and II area ) "so far as the same is not and shall not
be assigned to any tribe or tribes, shall remain a common hunting ground,
during the pleasure of the President, for the ?aunees and other.friendly
Indians, who shall be permitted by the President to hunt on the same”
Art. II, Treaty of October 9, l833 C? Stat. h88).
75..(a) The Claims I and II area was not available for purchase
by white settlers immediately after its cession by the Pawnees. ‘With
the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Territorial Act (?*y 33, l8§h), the
Public Sale and Private Entry Act became applicable to public land

within those territories. As amended April 2h, l82O (3 Stat. 566)

8 Ind. :31. ‘Com. 6248 « y 672

the Act provided for the sale of surveyed public land to the highest
bidder for cash and fixed a minimum price of $1.25 per acre.

(b) The Act of July 22, l8Sh (l0 Stat. 308) extended the provisions of the pre-emption law to lands in Kansas and Nebraska which
had been ceded to the United States. The right of pre-emption meant
that the first settler on a quarter section (l6O acres) or less of the

public land acquired a priority right to the tract and could acquire

‘f.title thereto at the minimum government price of $1.25 per acre.

Settlers were permitted to enter on unsurveyed lands and, as soon-as
surveys were made, to select the loo acres whose surveyed lines
corresponded most closely with the land on which they had located.
Military scrip and land warrants were applicable upon the purchase
price. In 1852 land bounty warrants became assignable, and they were
listed on the stock market at prices below $1.25 per acre. The Secretary of Interior in his 1861 report stated that "land warrants now sell
in the market for fifty cents per acre" (Pet. Ex. Sh).

(c) The "Graduation Act" was passed August h, 185k (10 Stat. 57b)

‘to provide a downward sliding scale of prices for public lands which had_

been in the market and remained unsold for ten years or more.

(d) The "Homestead Act" was passed on May 20, 1862, (12 Stat. hl3)
which permitted qualified citizens to enter 160 acres or less of unappropriated lands, live upon the same for a period of five years, and

upon proof of compliance with the law, to receive a patent therefor with

a nominal filing fee and no charge for the land. A settler could obtain

title for his land before the expiration of the five year period by

paying the minimum price, or the price to which it may have graduated,

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6h8 673

provided proof of settlement and cultivation was made as provided by the
existing laws granting pre—emption right.

(e) The methods of disposing of the public domain to individuals
gas supplemented by substantial land grants to railroads and to states
for various purposes, which grants were then opened for sale to settlers.

76. (a) The Act of July 22, l8Sh, (10 Stat. 308) established the
first land office for the Territory of Nebraska at Omaha and provided
that its district should include all the public lands in Nebraska to
which Indian title shall have been extinguished. The Act also established
the Pawnee land district to encompass the public lands in the Territory
of Kansas, to which the Indian title shall have teen extinguished.

(b) On March 30, 1858, the President proclaimed the first public
land sale in the Territory of Nebraska. However, on August 2h, 1858,
the sale was ordered postponed until September, 1859. The first public
sales in both Kansas and Nebraska resulted in a great number of settlers
filing their preemption claims and acquiring their lands for $1.25 per
acre.

(c) The rate of land acquisition in Kansas and Nebraska is indicated by the following records of the respective land offices in the

two territories:

No evidence has been introduced upon which to base any findings

concerning the portions of the above tabulated land sales in Kansas

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6L8 675

and Nebraska which occurred in the Fawnee lands. However, it may be
noted that following the year l872 most of the Nebraska portion of the
Claims I and II area was within the Republican Valley Land District,
with the land office first at Lowell and later at Bloomington. The
average prices for land sales recorded by the Republican Valley Land

District were:

1873 7,2ou $2.33
187h 8,323 2.22
1875 3,933 2.22

These average sale prices for the Republican Valley Lend District were
lower than the overall state averages for l8?3, l8?h, and 1875 which were
$2.68, $é.69,‘and $3.27 respectively.

(d) The records of the Nebraska Land Offices show that up to
July 1, 1859, 802,159.39 acres in Nebraska were entered with only
lOl,l23.3h acres, or 12.6% of the total, paid for with cash while the
remaining 701,036.05 was paid for with land warrants. Public land

sales from.July'l, 1859, to July 1, l862, in Nebraska showed: (Pet. Ex. 5h)

77. By grant of.April 19, 186b, 2,702,0hh acres were granted to
Nebraska for school purposes. Sales of lands during the f’rst years of

common school land administration were:

     

Year _ épres Average price_ger acre

1870 6h,9OS 8.h8
1871 and 1872 25,253 ?.F3

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6h8 676

The total sales amounted to only b.l% of the available school lands.
There is no evidence to show what portion, if any, of the sales were within
or near the Claims I and II area, or whether the sales price included
payrents for improvements on the land (Pet. Ex. Sh). F
78. Petitioner's expert appraisers did not express any conclusion
as to their estimate of the fair market value of the Claims I and II
area in 1833. Petitioner in its requested findings of fact urges a
valuation of $1.25 per acre.
Defendant's expert, Dr. Murray, concluded from all the evidence
outlined in his detailed report (Def. Ex. 181) that the subject area had
a market value in l833 of $2,6lh,800.00, or an average of 20 cents an acre.
79. After carefully weighing all the evidence of record, the

Commission finds that the Claims I and II tract of over 13 million acres

was, in l833, located in an area removed from the populated sections

‘of the United States, with poor means of transportation through the

area. ‘While there uere choice locations on the fine bottom lands, mainly
along the water courses, which locations would have attracted settlers
in 1833, there were large areas of less desirable land, which, although
suitable for cultivation, would have been in very limited demand in
1833 and have brought a nominal price per acre if placed on the open
market. There was also a vast area of land classified as suitable for
grazing for which there was virtually no demand in l833.

Any prospective purchaser of the Claims I and II area would have
realized that it would be many years before he could expect to dispose
of any substantial acreage of this immense holding. ‘While he could

expect to resell the best lands in a short time and at good prices, he

8 Ind. c1. Com. 6118 677

would still have a large investment in the tract which could not be recovered until the population movement had reached the area and even then
there would be a limited demand for the poorer land, at least until the
more favorably located tracts in the surrounding areas had been disposed
of.
80., The Commission finds that the l3,07h,OOO acres had a fair

market value, as of October 9, 1833, of $h,S75,900.00 or an average per
acre value of thirty—five cents.

Consideration for 1833 Treaty

 

‘\

81. Under the various articles of the l83) treaty the United States
agreed to:

Art. III ”....pay said bands annually, for the term of
twelve years, the sum of fortyesix hundred dollars in goods
....as follows: to the Grand Pawnees and Republican villages,
each thirteen hundred dollars, and to the Pawnee Loups and
Tappage Pawnee villages each one thousand dollars, and said
annuity to said Grand Pawnees is in full remuneration for removal from.the south to the north side of the Platte, and
building again." L '

_Art. IV "....to each of said four tribes, for five years,
the sum of five hundred dollars in agricultural implements;
and to be continued longer if the President thinks proper.“

Art. V "....one thousand dollars a year for ten years,
for schools to be established for the benefit of said four
bands at the discretion of the President.” .

Art. VI "....two blacksmiths and two strikers, with shop,
tools and iron, for ten.years, for said four bands, at an

expense not exceeding two thousand dollars in the whole
annually."

Art. VII “....to furnish each of said four tribes with a

farmer for five years, and deliver to said farmers for the
benefit of said nation, one thousand dollars value in oxen
and other stock."

Art. VIII "....to erect, for each of said four hands, a
horse-mdll for grinding corn."

8 Ind. C1. Com. 6h8 7 675

Art. XII ".... In case the Pawnee nation will remain at home

United States agree to place twenty-five guns, with suitable
_ ammunition, in the hands of the farmers of each village ...."

Art. XIII ”....the amount of sixteen hundred dollars in
goods and merchandise ...." I

82. The defendant has introduced in evidehce a report of the General
Accounting Office (Def. Ex. 18h) listing yearly appropriations and indicating the amounts appropriated under the various articles of the treaty.

The totals of such appropriations were:

that the sums shown in the General Accounting Office Report were dis-C
bursed to the Pawnee Indians for the purposes itemized in said report.
That stipulation was approved by the Commission by order dated May 3,
1960. h

8h. The Commission finds that the following sums, disbursed to
the petitioner pursuant to the agreement of the United States under the
1833 Treaty, constituted payments in consideration for the cession of

the Claims I and II area to the United States by the Pawnee Indians:

85. The disbursement of $l,h22.CO under Article XII of the treaty
was for the purpose of placing 2S guns, with suitable ammunition, in the
hands of the (white) farmers of each village to he used in case of an
attack from hostile bands. This was pursuan to the agreement made
by the United States on condition that the Pawnee Eation remain at home
during the year and give protection to the teachers, the farmers, stock
and mill. The Commission finds that this payment was consideration for
the separate agreement by the Pawnees to provide the protection specified and was not consideration for the cession of lands.

86. The total consideration for the cession of the Claims I and
II area to the United States was $lh8,200.0G. This amount was disbursed to the petitioner and was, therefore, the anount constituting
the United States‘ payment on the claim.

37. The total consideration of $lh8,203.GJ provided for under the
terms of the Treaty of October 9, 1833, £01 ‘he cession of the Claims I
and II area to the United States by the petitioner was so grossly inadequate an amount for lands having a value of $h,S7S,900.00 as to

make the consideration unconscionable.

Claim III Area
88. The tract referred-to as the Claim.III area, which the Commission has hereinbefora determined was held by petitioner under original Indian title, is described in Finding of Fact No. 3b and was

found to comprise 11o,h19 acres of land (Finding of Fact No. 35). The

3 area is to be valued as of August 6, 18b8, the date of the treaty by

which the Indians ceded the lands to the United States.

89. The Claim.III area is located in the Platte River Valley
bounded on the west by the present city of Fort Kearney, Nebraska; on
the east by a line about 10 miles east of the present city of GrandIsland; on the north by the bluffs north of the Platte River; and on
the south by the south bank of the South Channel of the Platte River.
The area is about h miles wide at the western border and 3 to h miles
wide at the eastern edge. It is about 50 miles long from.east to west.
It is in central Nebraska in the present counties of Buffalo, Adams,
Hall, and Merrick. The eastern edge of the Claim.III area is about l2O
miles west of the Missouri River, which forms the boundary between Iowa
and Nebraska.

90.. The Commission finds that the ll0,hl9 acres, previously found

to have been the land area of the subject tract and stipulated to by'the

-parties as the area to be valued, relates to the land area exclusive of

the Platte River bed.

The Department of the Interior, in compliance with the defendant’s
request, made a planimter computation of the area of the islands in
the Platte River within the Claim III area. The acreage was thus

determined to be 76,ShO acres (Def. Ex. 165). Defendant's expert

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6h8 . . 681

aporaiser, =r. Murrav

- :13

has reportrd that the land area north of the
Platte River within the snciect tract was just all tlv less in acreage

0

than the island areas (Def. Ex. 182, p. 7). His ' cimated percentages

were:
Bottom lands and terrace J1?
Islands in Platte River '>%

Riverbed (Platte Channels) 15%

.' He applied these percentage figures to the sti;'lated acreage of llO,hl9
acres. However, under our finding, the l10,hlf eras applies only to
his first two classifications a‘ cat acreage not include his
15% riverbed estimate.

91.“ The topography of the dlaim III area ls _3neral1y level. The

elevation ranges from.about 2,100 feet in the west to 1,700 feet in

"the east.
. 92. rThe tract is well watered by the Platte River, which flows

‘through every township in the area. At the western edge of the Llaim III
area the Platte River forks into a north and south channel.g There are a
:number of meanders known as the north, middle, and south channels of the
Platte River as it flows through the area with the various channels
joining near the tract's eastern edge. In addition to the water of the
Platte River, there was underground water available at a depth of about
16 to 20 feet.
93. The average annual precipitation is approximately 25 inches.
The growing season ranges from about 158 days in the west to 161 days
at the easterly end.
9h. The tract was fairly well timbered with the best quality along.

W

the banks of the Platte River and on the islands. While not of a

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 P _ 682

commercial value, its presence was a necessity for the early settlers.

iThere were no minerals within the tract. The original surveyors’ notes

referred to mill sites in two of the townships comprising the area.

95. The bottom lands and terrace north of the Platte River were
mostly of excellent quality and well suited for cultivation. The islands
in the Platte River were a mixture of lst and 2nd rate soils. They were
partly adapted to cultivation with the remainder best suited for grazing.
The major portion of the area had a highest and best use for cultivation
while only a minor portion had a highest and best use for grazing. That
portion best suited for grazing was above average in that respect since‘
there was available water for livestock as well as the settlers, and
there was sufficient timber for buildings, fuel, fences, and protection
from the weather .

' 96. ‘While the Platte River was not navigable, its'broad valley’

- provided a good wagon route. The Mormon Trail started at Council Bluffs,

Iowa, and went west to the Platte River, following the Platte.through

-- the ‘Claim III area. As described in Finding of Fact No. 61, the Oregon

.Trail joined the Platte River at Fort Kearney, on the western edge of

the subject tract.,

Railroads were still far removed from the west in l8h8, and the
prospect of their development in Nebraska could have had but little_effect
on the market value of the Claim III area.

97. The country's population was moving westward in the l83O to
l8h8 period. In l8h0 the southeast corner of Iowa had been settled

and the state's population was h3,ll2. By 1850 settlement had extended

up to the center of the state, and the population had grown about 3b6%

8 Ind. Cl. Con. 6&8 683

to l92,2lh. The population of Missouri increased from lhO,hSS in l83O
to 383,702 in l8hO and to 682,0hb in l8§O. The first census in Nebraska
has taken November 20, l8Sh, at which time there was a total of 2,832
:people recorded.

98. The history of the settlement of Kansas and Nebraska indicates
:that'the early settlers followed the rivers where they sought wooded
areas, the alluvial soil of their valleys, and water. As defendant's

‘expert appraiser, Dr. Murray, stated in his report, "The Platte River

'valley in l8h8 was the most likely area to be settled if any area in

‘central Nebraska was settled. And this is what actually happened.

:The trees, water, and good soil in the Platte Valley attracted the first
‘settlers in central Nebraska.“ (Def. BX. 182, p. 23). However, it was
‘almost 10 years after the l8h8 evaluation date before settlement of the
:C1aim.III area began. In a history of Hall County; Nebraska, (the middle

portion of the subject tract is in Hall County), it is recorded, "In

71857, when the spring sun rose over the prairie there was not a white

'Hen.within the present boundaries of Hall County. During that year

:5 little'band of thirtyafive people arrived and located in the great

'solitude“ (Def. Ex. 168).

1 99. In l8h8 the country experienced a mild recession. Interest
rates were high. Long term government loans brought 6% interest while
short term commercial paper was commanding rates of from 12% to l8% with
the rate for August, l8h8, reported to have been 12% to lS%.

100. Any prospective purchaser of the Claim III area would have
Considered the other lands available on the market in l8h8. The land

88 In l8h8 there was continuing agitation to reduce the price of unsold public lands. In his first annual message to Congress on December 2,
l8hS, President James K. Polk endorsed the proposal for a graduation
system;" He referred to the fact that large quantities of the public
lands were on the market and remained unsold because they would not
command the $l;2S per acre minimum price. By'a policy of graduation

and reduction of price the inferior lands could be sold for their "real

’ value."

101. Petitioner has urged consideration of the various categories
of sales data referred to in the findings relating to the Claims I and
II area.8 The Commission has made findings with respect to certain of
those categories in Findings of Fact No. 72(a), (b), and (C) and they’
will not be repeated here.

Petitioner has presented private sales data of non-railroad lands
in the counties of Hall, Merrick and Adams, portions of which are included in the Claim.III area. ‘With the exception of two sales in Hall
County in 1863, the earliest sales were in l866. The sales data cover

a period from 1866 to l87§, a period of 18 to 27 years after the l8h8

valuation date.

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 ' 685

The few recorded sales for Hall County cover a wide range of value.
There was one sale in 1867 of 1,678 acres (the largest tabulated sale)
for $l,l00.00 or an average per acre price of only 65% cents.’ There
was also listed a sale in l87S of 9.5 acres for $500.00 or an average
per acre price of $52.63. The l9 tabulated sales for Hall County from
1863 through l87S totaled 3,236.5 acres at an averageprice oi $3.26
per acre. A total of 2,2Sh.2 acres or about 70% of all tabulated sales.
in.Hall.County occurred in Township ll North, Range 09 West. That township contains the present day city of Grand Island and was reported by
the original surveyorin August, 1866, to contain land above the common
average with level bottom land of an excellent duality with “more settles. .

_the bank of the Platte River." I = 8 8 8

.8 While there are greater numbers of tabulated sales in Merrick and

Adams Counties, there are just a few sales listed for those townships

within the Claim III area. The only part of Adams County within the

;Claim III area is the extreme northwest corner of Township 8 North,

Range 12 West.
102. Our findings with respect to the petitioner's use of census

values of land to arrive at a fair market value figure is set forth in

Finding of Fact No. 73 and need not be repeated here.

10h. Petitioner's expert appraisers did not express any conclusion

as to their estimate of the fair market value oi the Claim III area in

* i18h8. 'Petitioner in its requested findings of fact urges a valuation

\.

of $5.00 per acre.
1 H 105.‘ Defendant's expert, Dr. Murray, concluded irom all the euidence outlined in his detailed report (Def. Ex.‘l82, pp. 3-hi) that the
subject area had a market value in 18MB of $55,210 or an average o£.SO
cents per ;c;.. “Dr. Murray‘s conclusion was based on his finding that
15% or l6,hl§ acres of the stipulated ll0,hl9 acres in the Claim III
area was riverbed.i As we havepreviously found, the }:§e£bea'éc£é§ge

has already been excluded from the area computation and is not in% cluded in the ll0.hl§ acre figure. An adjustnent might he made to Dr.

hmrray*s figures to correct this misinterpretation by elindnating the
l6;hl9 acres of riverhed which he considered to have had snall economic
value and which defendant has recognized as actually hauing tno valued
in thenselves.§i (Defendant's Requested Findings of Fact, filed Nov. 27,
1959, p- b9). Figuring his $55,210 valuation as applying to his figures
of hh,000 acres and 50.000 acres for botton lands and islands; respectivelg, his average per acre valuation vould have been 58.7 cents.

106. The Commission has carefully weighed all the evidence relating

to the market value of the Claim III area as of August 6, l8h8. The

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6hB 057

Commission finds that the size of this_tract would have made it attractive
to a prospective purchaser in l8h8 since this ll0,hl9 acre tract could
have been purchased with much less of a financing problem and more easily
.disposed of in contrast with the immense l3 million acres involved in

the Claims I and II area. The subject area was also desirable land,

most of it being first rate bottom land. It was located onpa traveled

uagon route with adequate water and some scattered timber. Any prospective purchaser could have expected that he would be able to dispose
of substantially all of the tract within a relatively short period.

While white settlement had not occurred in the area in 18b8, this was

. due to the unavailability of this Indian country. ,Population was increasing along the Missouri River, and it could be foreseen that it would

»be soon entering the area to the west._

107. The Comrrdssion finds that the 11o,L19 acres in the Claim III

_area had a fair market value, as of August 6, 18b8, of $99,380.00 or an

average per acre value of ninety cents.

_ 1085. The Treaty of August 6, l8hB, recited in Art. 2, "In con;sideration of the land hereby ceded and relinquished, the United States

.has this day paid .... the amount of two thousand dollars in goods and

merchandise, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged." (9 Stat. 9h9)
The consideration of $2,000.00 paid by defendant to petitioner for the

cession of the Claim III area north $99,380.00 constituted an uncone

scionable consideration.

8 Ind. c1. Com.  . ' 688

Claim IV Area

l09. ‘The Claim IV area, which the Commission has hereinbefore
determined was held by petitioner under original Indian title, is
described in Finding of Fact No. b6. The parties have stipulated that
the Claim IV area contains 9,878,000 acres (Pet. Ex. 150). The tract
is to be valued as of September 2L, 1857, the date of the treaty by
which the Indians ceded the lands to the United States.

"110. The tract is located in central Nebraska north of the Platte
River. It is approximately 200 miles wide from east to west and about
1&0 miles long from north to south. It is bounded on the east by the ;
former Omaha Indian tract, which was ceded to the United States in l5§h.
The east line begins near the present city of Schuyler on the Platte

River, follows Shell Creek in a northwesterly direction, and then turns

-north past the present city of Neligh. The north boundary is irregular

‘through the present city of Oiheill. The west boundary follows the 1851

Fort Laramie Treaty's eastern line down to the present city of North
Platte. The south boundar follows the Platte River, excluding the
Claim.III area, which tract has been valued above.

111. The topography of the Claim.IV area ranges from generally
level along the Platte River southern boundary to rolling land in the
eastern and northeastern portions and broken land in the central and
west part of the area. The elevation is from about 2900 feet in the
northwest to lSCO feet in the southeast.

112. The tract is in the Platte River drains

portion is drained bv the Platte River and it tributaries which, from

I.

.8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 . t 689

.west to east are Buffalo Creek, wood River, Prairie Creek and, on the

.eastern boundary, Shell Creek. The central portion is drained from

west to east by the Loup River system. The South Loup River drains
.the southwestern portion from the vicinity of Logan, Nebraska. The
Biddle Loup River enters the tract about the center of the western

boundary near Halsey, Nebraska, and flows southeasterly to join with

‘the South Loup River. ‘The North Loup River comes into the area at the

.northérTy quarter of the western boundary near Purdum, Nebraska, and

flows southeasterly at about the center of the Claim IV area. The

iNorth.Loup joins with the Calamus River and meets the nerged South and

Middle Loup branches about h miles northeast of St. Paul, Nebraska.

‘The main Loup River proceeds east to its junction with the Platte River

in the southeast corner of the C1aim.IV area. Cedar River and Beaver

acreek flow southeast through the eastern portion of the tract and

-empty into the-Loup River. The northeastern portion of the tract is

watered by the Elkhorn River. :
.113. The temerature and the-growing season is generally favorable

to crop production. The average growing season is approximately 150

«days ‘ranging from 1141 days in the northwest to 161 days in the southeast.

The average annual precipitation is 26 inches, ranging from.l8.2O inches

‘at the western edge to 28.37 inches at the eastern edge. Of these

precipitation averages, 77% occurs in the six month spring and summer
period while hS% is in the three months of May, June, and July. However,

the area is subject to periods of drought when hot, dry winds cause

serious and extensive damage to crops.

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 ' 690

llb. iMost of the timbered areas within the tract were located
ialong the rivers and streams and on the islands in the Platte River.
‘While there was no timber of any commercial value, its presence was
‘a necessity for the early settlers to provide fuel, building material,
‘fences and protection from the weather. or the 1:76 townships in the
area the original surveyors commented on the presence (or lack) of

timber in 328 townships as follows:

" Considerable, fine, good, dense, thick 2h
Groves, scattered, well, bodies, belted h2
- Scattered, some, little scarce 119

None, destitute, few, devoid, clumps, 5
' scrubby lh3

“ ll5. The original surveyors reported abundant water in 193 town"ships ‘with 78 townships possessing medium amounts of water, 15 townships

‘with fair amounts, and 125 townships with little or none. Many of the
itownships reportedly had water several feet below the surface. ‘Water
sufficient for settlement was present in approximately two-thirds of
the townships and insufficient in one-third of the townships,

.116. iBuilding stone was scarce in the area. ‘There were some salt
‘springs in the tract and evidence or some minerals, although none of
any commercial value.

11?. (a) Petitioner's expert appraisers, E. B. Horton, Jr., and

T. C. Hitchings, Jr., classified the land as follows:

First rate or bottcn land I l6.6%
Uplands or second rate 25.5%
Third rate lands 57.9%

(b) Defendant's expert appraiser, William G. Emrray, has

tabulated the original surveyor's descriptions contained in the surveys

p8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 ' 591

of each township in the tract. Bottom land was mentioned by the surveyors
in 281 of the tract‘s h76 townships. Quality was referred to in 250
townships with lb} having part or all of their bottom land in the excellent or first rate class and 91 in the second rate class. ‘With
respect to the quantity of bottom land there were 20 townships listed
as having a large amountof bottom land, 26 as having sone'bottom land,
and hl listed as having little bottom land with no comments in the
other townships as to quantitg.

Upland soil was mentioned by the surveyors in h2h of the tract's
h?6 tonnships. Dr. Murray classified the surveyors’ comments on upland

soil as follows:

lst rate (rich, etc.) 20 Twp.

1st and 2nd rate (combination) lh "
2nd rate (Good. etc.) 135 "
2nd and 3rd rate (combination) 68 "
3rd rate (Poor, etc.) 187 "

Total _ h2h "

._ ll8. The bottom lands were found principally along thePlatte,
Elkhorn and Loup Rivers and their tributaries. While the quality of the
bottom.lands was generally excellent they were relatively small in extent
where they did occur. The upland soils were generally below average in
quality with a vast region in the northeastern and north central portions
made up of sand hills. )The more favorable loess soils were in the eastern
part, and the rich river valley lowlands were in the south along the '
Platte River and extending along its principal tributaries.

"119. Our findings contained in Findings of Fact No. 61 and 96

concerning transportation are generally applicable to the Claim.IV

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 692

area and will not be repeated. There were no navigable rivers in this
tract.

However, with respect to the possibility of rail transportation
within the area, the Commission has noted that by 1857 railroads were

pushing westward. It could be foreseen that the railroads would soon

cross the Eissouri River and eventually extend across Nebraska. A

L prospective purchaser in 1857 would have recognized that the Platte

River valley would be an excellent route, although, of course, it would
still be many years before a rail line in the area could become a
reality. In fact the decision to adopt the Council Bluffs route along
the north bank of the Platte River was not made until 1863, and in that
year actual construction on the Union Pacific Railroad was started at
Omaha.

120. (a) Petitioner’s expert appraisers, based on the original
surveyors’ notes, classified h3% of the land as suitable for cultivation
and 57% suitable for grazing.

(b) iThe defendant's expert classified the area as to'its fitness

Adapted to grazing only 16% . 76 "

From his tabulation of surveyors’ comments Dr. Murray concluded that

farming and for the remaining half a highest and best use for grazing,

a very extensive and low value use.

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6118 ' L 693

l2l. The Commission finds that approximately one-half of the

Claim IV area had a highest and best use for cultivation and the remaining one-half had a highest and best use for grazing. The Commission

also finds that there were portions of the grazing land classification

which had practically no value even for that use. the an example the

following townships were described by the original surveyors as follows:
T 10 N, R 16 W

"This Township is dry and barren of vegetation except
short grass which is practically worthless for pasturage ..."

TlSN,Rl9W

"This Township is generally very rough and broken clay
hills. Third rate Destitute of wood and water and consequently unfit for grazing or agriculture."

b

T15N,R2L.w

"This is all'broken clay hills and rolling sand hills.
The soil is nearly all third rate. The Township is almost
destitute of timber and water and is not adapted to farming
or grazing."

T16N,Rl8W

" ... The upland is broken and hilly hard and dryand not
adapted to agriculture or grazing." ‘

T 16 N,IR 22VJl
“ ... The Township is not fit for farming or grazing."
T 2? N, R 11‘w

“The surface of this Township is generally broken sand
hills soil 3d rate. The sand is loose and grass scattering.
It is therefore unfit for agriculture and grazing."

And surveyor Homer Stout in his survey of T 27 N, R 22'W was inspired

to write:

8 Ind. c1. Com. ens 59h

“Describe, Praise it if you will, Twill be nothing

but Sand hills Still Sand--Sand--Sand--without an Oasis

to cheer the vision, Even the Valleys are sand--devoid

of either water or timber, ‘what I know about farming’

does not tell me what it is good for." '

The portion suitable for cultivation would have been used fort
subsistence farming.‘ In 1857 there were no markets to which agricultural
products could have been profitably shipped from the Claim IV area.

l22. (a) Population moved into Nebraska rapidly after the Territory was opened to settlement with passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act
of l8Sh; The first census in Nebraska was taken November 20, l8Sh, and

recorded 2,832 persons. Most of the early settlements were in the southeast corner and along the.Missouri River and, for a short distance, along
the Platte River. The l8SS population was h,h9h. By 1856 the eastern
counties in Nebraska had been formed and the population figures indicate the concentration of population in those counties bordering the
Missouri River. The four most populated counties were Douglas (3h6S),
Otoe (1862), Nemaha (1281), and Cass (1251). Platte County had 35
persons. Nebraska‘s population in 1860 was 28,8hl. By that year

countiesfalong the Platte River, which included part of the Qlaim IV

\

area, had been formed. The population figures for those counties in

l860'were:

Dawson 16
Buffalo 11h
Hall 116
Merrick 109 (U. s. Eighth Census, 1865

By 1870 counties had been formed south of the Platte River but
there were no additional counties formed in the Clain1IV area. The
north central and northwestern portions of the state were still unorganized territory. The l8?O population figures were:

123. The surveys of the lands in the Claim IV area commenced in
1858, in the easternmost townships, and continued westward along 866":
Platte Riner. 8urveys in the north central and northwestern portion of
the tract were not undertaken until the 1871 to 187k period.

128. The year 1856 was a period of general activity with revival

in railroad construction. However, 1857 brought a depression with tight

money and runs on banks. The short term interest rate, 8hich had ranged

from 7% to 10% for the first eight months of 1837, rose sharply in
September of 1857 to a high of 368. Long term interest rates were inii'
the 5% to 7% range in 1857. A reasonable interest rate to attract the
capital required for 5 purchase of the Claim IV area in 1857 would have
been about 8%. in I

' "' 125. any prospective purchaser of the 9,878,000 acre Claim IV
area would have considered the other lands available on the market in
1857. There were vast acreages of public land available in both Kansas
and Nebraska. Just east of the Claim IV area was the "Omaha Tract" of
h,982,098 acres which had been ceded to the United States on March 16,
185h. By the close of 1858, 80% of the maha tract had been surveyed.
There were settlers in that area in 1857, and, when it was offered for

sale, the southeast portion and the areas along the Hissouri River were

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 _ 697

quickly disposed of. However, most of the area was undisposed of in
l857. In l8Sh there had been cessions of other Indian tracts in Kansas

and Nebraska:

March 15, l8Sh Otoe and Missouria 1,250,000 acres
May 6, l8Sh Delaware 560,000 "
May 10, I858 Shawnee l,h00,000 "

May 18, l85h Kickapoo 618,000 "
May 30, l8Sh Peoria 208,000 "
June 5, I851; Miami 500,000 "

Many of these areas were more favorably located in comparison with
the Claim.IV area. Several of the tracts bordered the navigable Missouri
River, were closer to more populated areas, and possessed better land.

126. Upon passage of the Graduation Act of August h, l8Sh,public
lands were available at reduced prices in the following amounts: Millions of acres

12?. (a) Petitioner has urged consideration of the various categories of sales data referred to in the findings relating to the Claims I
and II areas. The Commission has made findings with respect to certain
of those categories in Findings of Fact No. ?2 (a), (b), and (c), and

they will not be repeated here.

(b) Petitioner has introduced into evidence the earliest private
sales data for Holt County, Nebraska. The sales, which total 5,009.8
acres, cover a period from 1871; through 1880, some 17 to 23 years after
our valuation date. Holt County is in the north central portion of the

tract and extends to the north beyond the Claim IV area. Petitioner‘s

tabulation indicates an average. per acre price of $2.72 for the 115585

Holt County sales .

A majority of the tabulated sales lie outside the Claim Pf area
and, in fact, are almost exclusively restricted to the lands along the
Niobrara River to the north of the subject tract.

The only tabulated sales in this county within the Claim IV area

are 3

Of course these cannot be all first sales since there is

‘This section is adjacent to the Elkhorn Niver, described by the original surveyor of this township
in 1871 as "a stream about 30 links wide, sandy
bottom 18 inches deep, gentle current." The Elkhorn River in this township had a wide bottom of
sandy loam ranging from let to 2nd rate. The sur- _
veyor found the township "well adapted to agriculture,
grazing, and stock raising."

8The total Holt County sales acreage tabulated within the Claim.IV
area was l,89h.h acres. There were no other sales listed for some 32
full townships (?3?,280 acres) of Holt County within the Claim IV area.

The tabulated earliest private sales in Rock County, Nebraska,
immediately to the west of Holt County, cover just the year 1889, 32
years after the valuation date. The average per acre price is indicated
as $0.92. However, again the Commission finds a majority of these
listed sales occurred to the north of the subject tract along the
Niohrara River. It also appears that multiple sales are included, as

‘we have detailed findings concerning the private sale data for
Hall County under our Finding of Fact No. 101. Hall County is partially
within the Clain1IV area along the Platte River.

128. Our findings with respect to the petitioner’s use of census
values of land to arrive at a fair market value figure are set forth
in Finding of Fact No. 73 and need not be repeated here.

129. In Findings of Fact Nos. 75, 76 and 77 we have set forth in
general the history of land disposal statutes affecting the early disposition of the public lands of Nebraska together with findings concerning

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 701

the rate of such disposal. As mentioned in Finding of Fact No. 75(b),
land bounty warrants became assignable in l852 and they were listed on
the stock markets at prices below $1.25 per acre. The quotations on
per acre selling prices for land warrants averaged from $0.81 to $1.08
during the period from September 5, 1856 through December 9, 1857.

130. Petitioner’s expert appraisers did not express any conclusion
as to their estimate of the fair market value of the Claim.IV area in
l857. Petitioner in its requested findings of fact urges a valuation
of $1.56 per acre.

131. Defendant's expert, Dr. Murray, concluded from all the evidence outlined in his detailed report (Def. BX. 182, pp. bl-llO) that
the subject area had a market value in 1857 of $3,h5?,300.00 or an

average of 35 cents per acre.
132. After carefully weighing all the evidence, the Commission

finds that the Claim IV tract of just under 10 million acres contained
a wide range of land as to quality and suitability of use to the early
settlers. There were areas of choice land well suited to agriculture

principally along the water courses, in particular the Platte, Loup,

and Elkhorn Rivers, with settlers in the area especially along the Platte‘

River. There were also large areas of marginal land in the transitional
loess-sandhill area. This land was partly adapted to farming and the
remainder to grazing. There was a vast region in the northwest containing sandhills which region was partly adapted to grazing and the
remainder worthless even for that use. There were poor means of transportation in most of the area. Only the Platte River valley, the

_southern boundary of the tract, was easily accessible with a well

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 702

traveled wagon route along the river and the prospect of a railroad line
along the Platte River. U

Any prospective purchaser of the Claim IV area would have realized
that he could easily dispose of the choice bottom land areas to the incoming settlers at attractive prices for the 1857 period. He could also
dispose of some of the less desirable cultivable land at lower prices.

However, at least half of the area would not have been in demand in

1857 nor could it be anticipated that it would be in demand for many

years. Further, portions of the sandhill area would have been considered
worthless in 185?, and any prospective purchaser would have realized
that those areas would be unsalable.

133. The Commission finds that the 9,878,000 acres had a fair
market value, as of September 21;, 1857, of sh, 939,000.00 or an average
per acre value of 50 cents. I

Consideration for 1857 Treaty

 

13h. Under the various articles of the 1857 treaty the United

States agreed to:

Art. I. ".... reserve a tract of country, thirty miles
long from east to west, by fifteen miles wide from.northr
to south, ....; and the Pawnees agree to remove to their
new homes, thus reserved for them, without cost to the
United States, ...."

‘.Art. II. ”.... pay to the Pawnees the sum of forty
thousand dollars per annum, for five years, commencing
on the first day of January, A. D. eighteen hundred and
fiftyaeightg and, after the end of five years, thirty
thousand dollars per annum, as a perpetual annuity, ...."

Art. III. ".... establish among them, and for their
use and benefit, two manual-labor schools, to be governed
by such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the
President of the United States, who shall also appoint
the teachers, and, if he deems it necessary, may increase

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6h8 703

the number of schools to four; .... and a sum not less
than five thousand dollars per annum shall be applied to
the support of each school, so long as the Pawnees shall,
in good faith, comply with the provisions of this article;
but if, at any time, the President is satisfied they are
not doing so, he may, at his discretion, discontinue the
schools in whole or in part."

Art. IV. ".... furnish the Pawnees:

First, with two complete sets of blacksmith, gunsmith,
and tinsmith tools, not to exceed in cost seven hundred
and fifty dollars; and erect shops at a cost not to exceed five hundred dollars; also five hundred dollars annually, during the pleasure of the President, for the
purchase of iron, steel, and other necessaries for the
same. The United States are also to furnish two blacksmiths, one of whom shall be a gunsmith and tinsmith;
but the Pawnees agree to furnish one or two young men of
their tribe to work constantly in each shop as strikers
or apprentices, who shall be paid a fair compensation for
their labor. P

Second. The United States agree to furnish farming
utensils and stock, worth twelve hundred dollars per annum,
for ten years, or during the pleasure of the President, and
for the first year's purchase of stock, and for erecting
shelters for"the same, an amount not exceeding three thousand dollars, and also to employ a farmer to teach the Indians the arts of agriculture.

Third. The United States agree to have erected on said
reservation a steam-mill, suitable to grind grain and to
saw lumber, which shall not exceed in cost six thousand
dollars, and to keep the same in repair for ten years;
also, to employ a miller and engineer for the same length
of time, or longer, at the discretion of the President;
the Pawnees agreeing to furnish apprentices, to assist in
working the mill, who shall be paid a fair compensation
for their services. ' '

Fourth. The United States agree to erect dwellinghouses for the interpreter, blacksmiths, farmer, miller
and engineer, which shall not exceed in cost, five hundred
dollars each; ....

Art. VII. ... furnish, in addition to the persons heretofore mentioned, six laborers for three years, ....

thereof, to give to each a horse worth one hundred dollars
in value.

Art. XII. .... enable the Pawnees to settle any just
claims at present existing against them, there is hereby
set apart, by the United States ten thousand dollars, ...."
135. Defendant has introduced in evidence a report of the General
Accounting Office (Def. Ex. 18h) listing yearly appropriations and indicating the amounts appropriated under the various articles of the

treaty and the purposes for which appropriated. The totals of such

appropriations were:

Art. I $ 1,000.00
Art. II 2,Sh0,000.00
Art. III 728,732.8h
Art. Iv . 531,958.56  
Art. VI 9,000.00
Art. X‘ 1,000.00
Art. XI 500.00
Art. XII 10,000.00

Miscellaneous 38l,9hO.28
Total $h,20h,131.68
136. By stipulation, dated April 29, l960, the parties have agreed
that the sums shown in the General Accounting Office Report were disbursed to the Pawnee Indians for the purposes itemized in said report
up to and including fiscal year l928. ‘It was further agreed that as
to the lump sum.appropriati0ns for the fiscal years l929 through l93S,
the Commission shall consider that the ans: ts appropriated for each of
those fiscal years in the sum of not to exceed $53,000.00 were disbursed

to the Pawnee Indians for the same purposes and in the same amounts as

8 Ind. 01. Com. die I 705

itemized for fiscal year l928. Any amount appropriated in excess of

the $50,000.00 for any of those fi cal years shall be considered administrative expense.

l37. (a) The $1,000.00 appropriated under Article I of the treaty
was for surveying the exterior boundaries of the reservation. There is
nothing in the language of Article I to indicate that this service was
to be performed by the United States as part of the consideration for

the cession. The Commission finds this sum.was not a part of the cons sideration.

(b) The total sum of $2,Sh0,000.00 appropriated under Article II

of the treaty included $200,000.00 paid at the rate of $00,000.00 per

year for the first five years and the remainder of $2,lh0,000.00 represented the perpetual annuity payments of $30,000.00 per year thereafter. V

The provision in this article for payment of $h0,000.00 per year
for five years constituted a limited annuity. The yearly payments were
installments of the total $200,000.00 payment and this sum represents
the value of that portion of the consideration and was the amount of
the United States’ payment on the claim. .

‘However, the remaining provision of Article II created a perpetual
annuity. its capitalized or funded value represented the value of the
consideration agreed to be paid under this proviso of the treaty. Using
an interest rate of 5% per annum, the funded value of a $30,000.00
per year perpetual annuity was $600,000.00. The sum of $600,000.00,
therefore, represents the value of that portion of the consideration.

However, since no portion of that principal sum was ever paid to the

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6h8 706

Pawnees, no amount will be deducted from the final judgment as payment
on the claim under this provision of Article II.

(0) All items listed under Article III, in a total amount of
$728,732.8h, were in fulfillment of agreements made under that article
and represent the value of the consideration for the cession by the
Pawnees. The payment by the United States to the Pawnees of that
amount entitles the United States to deduct the $?28,732.8h as payment

on the claim.
(d) All of the items listed under Article IV of the treaty totaled
$531,958.56. Of this amount there were items totaling:

$ 1,600.00 for "pay of shoemaker and carpenter”; and_
66,600.00 for "physician and medicine." °

 ' $ 68,200.00 Total

There was no provision in the 1857 treaty for providing any shoemakers,
carpenters, physicians or medicine to the Pawnees. The Commission finds
these items were not part of the consideration and they will not be
deducted as payments on the claim. The remaining amount of $h63,TS8.S6
represents the value of the consideration, and the payment by the United
States to the Pawnees of that amount entitles the United States to deduc
it as payment on the claim.

(e) The items under Article VII totaling $9,000.00 are allowed as

part of the consideration and will be deducted as a payment on the claim.‘

(f) The $1,000.00 item under Article X is allowed as part of the
consideration and will be deducted as a payment on the claim.
(g) The $500.00 item under Article XI is allowed as part of the

consideration and will be deducted as a payment on the claim.

8 Ind. 01. Com. 6&8 707

(h) The $10,000 item under Article XII is allowed as part of the
consideration and will be deducted as a payment cm.the claim.

(i) The miscellaneous items of:

Transportation and
insurance on annuities $11,000.00

Nbnies erroneously
carried to Treasury and

deposited as surplus 2?6.87
Care and support of

Pawnees 15, 0010.00
Support of Pawnees 588.h1

were not expenditures provided for in the treaty. ‘We find these items
were not part of the consideration and they will not be deducted as payments on the claim.

(3) The lump sum appropriations, totaling $353,775.00, cover the
fiscal years 1929 through 1935. The yearly amount of each lump sum
appropriation up to $S0,000.0, is to be charged to the items listed in

the 1928 appropriations in the same proportionate amount and for the

same respective purposes. The 1928 items were:

Art. II

‘Payment of annuity $ 30, 000.00 6055
Art. III

Pay of treaty employees 7,300.00 1h.6%

$50,000.00 100.0%
As set forth in subparagraph (b) above the payments of the perpetual

annuity under Article II were neither part of the consideration nor

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 708

payments on the claim. As set forth in subparagraph (d) above payments
for "physician and medicine" were not part of the consideration and will

not be deducted as payments on the claim.

0f the lump sum appropriations for fiscal years 1929 through l93b,.

which in each year were $50,000.00 or more, the allowable items for

each year as part of the consideration and as payments on the claim are:

Art. III $11,000.00
Art. Iv 7,800.00
Total. $18,800.00

The total for those 6 years is $112,800.00.
The appropriation for 1935 was $b9,l7S.00. The proportionate
anwunts constituting allowable items as part of the consideration and

as payments on the claim are:

Art. III $10,818.50
Art. IV 7,671.30
Total $l8,h89.80

(Finding Of Faci l37(b)). A11 ouher items listed in Finding of Fact
N0. 138 were disbursed to the petitioner, and, therefore, the following

constitutes the United States‘ payment on the claim:

1&0. The tota1 consideration of $2,1hh,609.9O provided for under
the terms of the Treaty of September 2b, 185?, for the cession of the
Claim IV area to the United States by the petitioner was so grossly
inadequate an amount for lands having a value of $h,939,000.00 as to
make the consideration unconscionable.

Claim V Area»

lhl. The Claim V area represents the land excluded from the
western boundary of the Pawnee reservation by an error in the original
survey. The Claim V tract is a rectangular area one-half mile wide,
east and west, and fifteen miles long, north and south. The parties
have stipulated its acreage to be h8OO acres, which is to be valued
as of March 3, 18?S.

1h2. ‘The area to be valued is in Merrick County along the
western boundary of Nance County. Its southerly end lies just south
of the main branch of the Loup River and is about 23 miles north and

3 miles east of the city of Grand Island, Nebraska.

8 Ind. 01. Com. 6L3 710

lb3. The southern portion of the tract is level in the Loup
River valley but becomes broken upland just north of the valley and
undulating rolling upland farther north. The elevation ranges from
1800 feet in the south to 2100 feet about the middle of the area and
about 2000 feet on the north.

lhh. The area is drained at the south by the Loup River, and

the south branch of Timber Creek flows across the north border of the

‘tract. The only timber in the area was in the south one-third of the

tract.

115. The climate is similar to that described in Claim Iv with
a 151 day growing season and an average annual precipitation of about
27 inches, with narm season rainfall averaging 20 inches.

lhé. About 10% of the area, in the Loup River valley, had good
bottom land soil of first and second rate quality. The remaining 90%,
to the north, uas second and third rate upland soil.

1
About 85% of the area had a highest and best use for cultivation

with the remaining 15% best suited for grazing.

1&7. In 1875 the chief transportation routes to and from the
01aimNV area were wagon roads. There was a wagon road along the north
bank of the Loup River that was shown on the 1876 survey plats. The '
area was readily accessible from the Platte River valley, which was
about 20 miles to the southeast. The Union Pacific Railroad ran through
the Platte River valley and provided excellent rail connections both to
the east and west.

1&8. The population figures for the tate of Nebraska were 25,8hl

in 1860; 122,993 in 1870; and hS2,h02 in 1880. During the l870's

8 Ind. C1. Com. 638 . 711

0

settlers were leaving the river areas and entering the interior regions.
During the early 1870‘s settlenent began in the Claim V area.
lh9. In 1873 the United States suffered a depression which continued through l875. Interest rates ranged from 55 to 10% in 1875.

A reasonable interest rate to attract the capital required for a pur'chase of the Claim V area in 1875 would have been about 7”.

150. (a) By the Act of April 10, 1876 (19 Stat. 28), the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to appraise and sell the Pawnee
reservation. The reservation lands were to be appraised "at their
actual cash value....separately from the value of any improvements
thereon" in tracts of 160 acres. The lands were to be advertised for
a period of three months in one newspaper each in dew York, Washington,
Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Columbus, iebraska and Omaha. The lands
were to be sold in separate tracts of 160 acres, at not less than their
appraised value, or for less than $2.50 an acre. The lands could be
bought on terms of one-third cash, the balance in two annual installments
drawing six percent interest from the date of sale.

(b) The total figures for the appraisal were: (Eef. Ex. 182, p. 13h)

Total acres 278,837.20
Average value/acre $2.6898
Total value of land $750,025.95
Value of improvements $ 9,3h5.00
Total appraised value 1 $759,370.05

The Claim V area was the western one-half mile of Townships l5,
l6, and 17, Range 8 (i.e., the western half of sections 6, 7, l8, 19,
30 and 31 in each or those townships). The appraisal figures for the
ull sections to the

eastern half of those céctions plus the adjoinin

The Loup River and the bottom land in its valley were located in
Township 15, Range 8, which had the highest appraisal,'with the poorer

upland soils in the two northern townships appraised at much lower

mfigures.

. 151. The sale of the reservation lands began on July 15, 1878.

Following-the first auction, at which sales were very small, the sales

Econtinued without competition. Anyone could select the land he wished,

with no limitation as to size or number of tracts which a person could

: purchase. The price was the appraised price, but not less than $2.50

per acre, with one-third down and the balance in two annual installments

with interest at.6%.

The rate of disposal of the entire reservation was:

Total 11,080 acres (Def. Ex. 182, p. 137)

,The difference between the 11,0h6 acres appraised, and the 11,080 sold

is due to rounding of figures in the sales. The one sale of 132 acres
in 1879 was in section 8T 15 N, R 8'w, along the Loup River. All the
sales were at either the $2.50 minimum price or at the appraised figure
if higher than $2.50.

152. As we have previously found, petiticner’s private sales
data covered sales almost exclusively on well watered, bottom.1and.
Those sales listed for Merrick County are generally along the Platte‘
River, Prairie Creek, or near Loup River on the north. There are many
small sales such as 5 acres for $60.00; 1 acre for $25.00; 1 acre for
$10.00; 8.b acres for $175.00; 8.h acres for $253.00; 0.3 acre for
$ho.oo; 1 acre for_$'(’5.00; and 3.11 acres for $1co.co.

153. Our findings with respect to the petitioner's use of census
values of land to arrive at a fair market value figure are set forth
in Finding of Fact No. 73 and need not be repeated here.

158. Petitioner‘s expert appraisers did not express any conclusion as to their estimate of the fair market value of the Claim V
area. Petitioner in its requested findings of fact urge? a valuation

Of $7.10 per acre.

155. Defendant's expert, Dr. Murray, concluded from all the
evidence outlined in his detailed report (Def. Ex. l82, pp. ll3—lhl)
that the subject area had a market value in 1875 of $12,000.00 or an
average of $2.50 an acre.

156. The Commission has carefully weighed all the evidence relating to the market value of the Clair1V area as of March 3, l8?5.

The Commission finds that the size of the tract would have made it

5 attractive to a prospective purchaser in 1875. It was located in an

area which was being settled. It was near good rail transportation.
The soil was fairly good with 85% of the area suitable for farming.
While the southern part of the area was well watered, the land to the
north lacked water. Any prospective purchaser could have expected to
be able to dispose of the entire tract within a few pears and have obtained a good price for the highly desirable southern portion in the
Loup River Valley and a lesser price for the upland soil area to the
north. A well informed prospective purchaser in 1875 would have found
the various categories of the lands involved to have had values comparable to the appraisal prices, made in l8?6, of the lands adjoining
the Claim V area to the east.

15?. The Commission finds that the h80O acres in the Claim V
area had a fair market value as of March 3, 1875, of $12,000.00, or
an average per acre value of $2.50.

158. By the Act of March 3, l8?5 (18 Stat. L20, h28), Congress
appropriated $6,000.00 to indemnify the Pawnees for the h800 acres,

and that sum was paid to petitioner.

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6&8 ' 715

159. The payment of $6,000.00 for the h800 acre Claim V area
was so grossly inadequate an amount for lands having a value of
$12,000.00 as to make the consideration unconscionable.
Claim.VI
160. On November 23, 1892, the United States and the Pawnee Tribe

entered into an agreement (I Kapp. h98) by the terms of which the
Pawnee Tribe ceded to the United States all of its reservation land

in Oklahoma.’ In consideration of this cession the members of the

tribe were to receive allotments in severalty in the reservation, and
by.Article IV “as an additional and only further consideration for
such cession and conveyance, the United States agrees to pay to said
tribe the sum of one dollar and twentyafive cents per acre for all the
‘surplus land in said reservation, after the allotments herein provided
for shall have been taken and approved by the Secretary of the Interior,
payable as follows: Eighty thousand dollars in coin, to be distributed
among them per capita at the subagency on said reservation upon the
ratification of this agreement by Congress, and the residue of the
proceeds of said surplus lands shall be placed to the credit of said
tribe in the Treasury of the United States and bear interest at the
rate of five per centum per annum, there to remain at the discretion
of the United States, the interest to be paid annually and be distributed to said tribe per capita on said reservation." This agreement was to become effective when ratified by Congress.

On March 3, l893 Congress passed an act (27 Stat. 412, she)

ratifying and confirming said agreement and appropriated the $80,000.00

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 6L8

to pay the Pawnee Tribe, and Section 12 of the act reading in part as

follows:

Said agreement is hereby accepted, ratified and confirmed. And the residue of the proceeds of the surplus
lands mentioned in said agreement shall be placed to the
credit of said tribe in the Treasury of the United States,
and shall bear interest at the rate of five per centum per
annum, said interest to be paid and distributed to said

tribe as provided in said Article four.
By resolution of the United States Senate, Senate Bill No. 10830
of the 61st Congress was referred to the U. S. Court of Claims on

_February 21, 1911, for a finding of fact and report thereon of claims

.which the Pawnee Tribe might have or c1aim.to have against the United

States, or for the failure of the United States to pay the tribe any
:money due. One of the claims presented by the Pawnee Tribe to the

Court of Claims, Pawnee Tribe of Indians vs. The United States, Sh C.

9 C15. 1,cwas_for surplus lands of the reservation in Oklahoma after

- allotment in severalty, ceded to the United States by the agreement

of November 23, 1892. The Court of Claims found that the $80,000 had
been paid, ?and allotments were made to each member aggregating
111,931.61 acres, leaving 171,088.37 acres of surplus lands, of'uhich
755 acres uere reserved for school and agency purposes, and continues
as tribal property, and the balance, 170,333.37 acres was disposed of
by the United States % % *." The court concluded a just c1aim.was
presented under the terms of the agreement for $1.25 per acre for,
170,333.37 acres, with interest thereon at 55 Per annum.from March 3,
1893, the date of the agreement ratified by Congress. The 755 acres
were a part of the surplus land conveyed to the United States under

the agreement of November 23, 1892.

161. Under the Act of March 1, 1907 (3h Stat. 1015, l0hh¥, the
United States issued a patent to the town of Pawnee, Oklahoma, for
88.h3 acres of land, in consideration of the sum of $110.55, or $1.25
per acre. The 88.h3 acres were located within the 755-acre tract of
Pawnee reservation land mentioned in the preceding finding. This
sum of $110.55 appears from the evidence to have been credited to the
account of the Pawnee Tribe on or about March 1?, 1921, but no interest
was ever paid the Indians on the $110.55, although the agreement of
November 23, 1892 and the Act of March 3, 1893 Provided that the proceeds of the surplus lands should bear interest at 5% per annum. The

interest on the $110.55 from.March 3, 1893 to March 17, 1921, has not

been paid to claimant.
ClaimfVII
162. Under and by virtue of the Act of March 3, 1909 (35 Stat. 781),

the United States on June 3, 1920, issued a patent to the Home Mission
Board of the Southern Baptist Convention, conveying 25.5b acres of land,
which was also located within the 755¥acre tract cf Pawnee reservation
land mentioned in the 160th finding. The Home Kission Board, and its
predecessors, had been doing missionary work among the Pawnees since

1880, and this land had been previously set aside by the Department of

the Interior for use in connection with this missionary work. The

claimant tribe received no payment for this 25.5h acres of land.
