.ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF EACT - ON OFFSETS

 

The Commission makes the following additional findings of fact:

35‘+0

39. Following the treaties of November 15, 1861 and February 27,
1867, the members of the Pottawatomie Tribe of Indians were separated
into two groups known as the Prairie Band in Kansas and the Citizen
Band in Oklahoma. On July 18, 1873, for the purpose of settling all
matters of difference between them arising under said treaties, the
Prairie Band and the Citizen Band entered into a written agreement in
which they agreed to accept and admit that the original enrollment made
under the provisions of said treaties containing 2,180 names, was
correct. It was further agreed that of that number, 1,MO0_were members
of the Citizen Band and 780 were members of the Prairie Band, and that
the entire assets of the Pottawatomie Nation as they existed at the time
of said original enrollment were to be divided on the basis of 780/2l80ths
to the Prairie Band and ihoo/eisothe to the Citizen Band.

NO. Between August 7, 1868 and June 30, 1951, the United States,
without treaty or contractual obligation to do so, expended gratuitously
from public funds certain amounts aggregating $hl,98l.l0, which the defendant now presents for offset credit against the award heretofore

entered against it in these consolidated cases. Of this total, $11,285.26

represents separate offsets claimed against the Prairie Band, and $30,695.8H

represents separate offsets claimed against the Citizen Band. The classifications and amounts of such claimed credits are divided into six groupings, of which two groups involve the Prairie Band and four the Citizen

Band, as follows:

U1.

The defendant, without treaty or contractual obligations to do
so, expended gratuitously for the benefit of the Prairie Band of the
Pottawatomie Tribe of Indians during the period from August 7, 1868 to
June 30, 1951, public funds for the purposes and in the amounts following,

which are proper offsets against the award heretofore granted:

Funeral Expenses 930.29

M2. During the period from July 1, 1919 to June 30, 1951, the

Prairie Band, the Iowa, Kickapoo and Sac and Fox Tribes or Bands of

Indians were under the jurisdiction of the following Indian.Agencies
in Kansas: Pottawatomie Agency 1921 to 1926; the Haskell Institute
from 1927 through 193M, and again under the Pottawatomie Agency since
1935. The General Accounting Office Report (pp. 388, 389) shows the
number of Indians in each tribe or band under the various agencies in
the years 1920 through 19M5. During the years 1938 through 19h5 the
members of the Prairie Band comprised, on the average, 53.1 percent

of the entire Indian population under the jurisdiction of the Pottewatomie Agency in Kansas.

H3. During the years 1938 through 19U5 the defendant gratuitously
expended for the benefit of the Indians under the Pottawatomie Agency
in Kansas, including the Prairie Band, the sum of $l,855.H0 for the
following purposes:

K

Agricultural Aid: Seed, fruit trees and fertilizer~$1,737.50

Provisions 117.90
Total §l,855.E5

That 53.1 percent of the $l,855.MO, or $985.21, is chargeable as an
offset against the Prairie Band for its proportionate share of the
benefits received from such expenditures.
Offsets Allowed Against the Citizen Band
nu. During the period from.August 7, 1868 to June 30, 1951, the

defendant without treaty or contractual obligations to do so, expended
gratuitously for the benefit of the Citizen Band of the Pottawatomie
Tribe of Indians, public funds for funeral expenses the sum of $3u7.o5,
which is a proper offset against the Citizen Band's share of the award

heretofore entered.

M5. During the period from July 1, 1877 to June 30, 1901, the
Citizen Band, the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi, the Kansas
Potawatomi Indians, the Kickapoos and other unidentified Indians,
were under the jurisdiction of the Sac and Fox.Agency in Oklahoma.
The General.Accounting Office report (pp. H25, H26) shows by years the
number of Indians in each tribe or band under said Agency. During the
years 1882 and 1883 the Citizen Band comprised approximately 29.9
percent of the entire Indian population under said Agency.

M6. During the years 1882 and 1883 there was expended for the
purchase of flour for the use of the Indians under the Sac and Fox
Agency, the total sum of $8H2.0M. These expenditures were made
gratuitously by defendant and it is entitled to an offset against the
Citizen Band on its share of the award of 29.9 percent of the $8U2.0M,
or $251.75.

#7. During the period from July 1, 1919 to August 31, 19u7, the
Citizen Band, the Kickapoos, the Absentee Shawnees, the Iowa, and the
Sac and For Indians were under the jurisdiction of the Shawnee.Agency
in Oklahoma. The General Accounting Office Report (p. M71) shows that
during 1938 the Citizen Band comprised 58.2% of the total Indian pnpulation under said Agency.

H8. In 1938, the defendant expended the sum of $#58.00 for the
purchase of garden seed for Indians under the Shawnee Agency. This
expenditure was made gratuitously by defendant and it is entitled to
an offset of 58.2 percent of the $#58.00, or $256.55 against the

Citizen Band‘s share of the award.

39. We find that the course of transactions between the United
States and the Prairie and Citizen Bands during the period here involved was such that the Commission may in good conscience allow the
defendant, as credits upon the award previously entered against it,
such gratuitous expenditures made by it as the Commission has found
to constitute proper offsets.

50. To summarize, the defendant is entitled to offset against
the award hereinbefore entered against it the sum of $5,o81.5h, which
is separately chargeable, as follows:

(1) Against the Prairie Band

Under Finding N0. #1 $3,160.97
Under Finding No. s3 983.21
Total $u,1u6.1s

(3) Against the Citizen Band
