INTERLOCUTORY ORDER

Upon the findings of fact numbered 1 through 222 and the opinion
filed in this case, which are hereby made a part of this order, this
Commission concludes as a matter of law that:

l. Plaintiffs, members of the Aleut Tribe of Indians residing
on St. Paul and St. George, Alaska, had a "special relationship"
with the Government by virtue of the Act of July 1, 1870 (16 Stat.
180) and the Act of April 21, 1910 (36 Stat. 326).

2. As a result of this special relationship the Government was
obligated to provide fair compensation and sufficient goods and
services to the Pribilof Aleuts during the entire 76-year period in
question.

3. The Aleuts carried on most major endeavors as a comunity.
The obligation owed by the Government was owed to the Aleuts as a
tribe and not to individual tribal members.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 1 153

4. The sealskin monopolists, the Government and its private
lessees, reaped profits of $46,418,399 during the 1870-1946 period.

5. The value of compensation, goods, and services provided the
Aleuts during the 76-year period was $4,099,949. The value of the
fair compensation, goods, and services the Government was obligated

to provide to the Aleuts was $15,339,553.

6. Since the United States and its lessees provided the money
equivalent of $4,099,949 to the Aleuts when the obligation was to
provide $15,339,553, the plaintiffs are entitled to a judgment
against the defendant in the amount of $11,239,604, less allowable

gratuitous offsets, if any.

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the plaintiffs herein recover from

the defendant the sum of $11,239,604, less allowable gratuitous offsets,

if any.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this case now proceed to a determination

of the gratuitous offsets, if any, which may be allowable under the
Indian Claims Commission Act.

Dated at Washington, D. C., this 9th day of June 1978
