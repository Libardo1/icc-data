Witt, Chief Commissioner, delivered opirion of the Commission.

This Ccmmission in its Conclusions of.‘ Law and  A1-zard in the

 

above numbered cause under date of Iay 6, 1959 held that the offset-L
in the amount of «'3.-537l*.,h65 .02 claimed by the defendant should not be
allowed and said order disaJ.loz-red said claim of offset.

C At the tine of making said order no opinion was given as to why said
offseti-:as disalloz-:ed_, nor had a reason been given for the diseJ.J.ot-rance
of the _c'l.ad.zn as a credit. Since the ma1§:ing of said orders, it has %
occurred to the Comrlission that it might be well for it to give the
groums upon which said determzlnations were made.

The undisputed records in’ evidence with reference to said item of
$37h,3.L65.02 show that in a proceeding in the Court of  in l9l8
it held that the defendant had in a treaty dated April 17, 185).; agreed

1'-0 pay the Omaha Tribe $934, 739.5}; for 783,365 acres of land and that

S 71;

4-5’: '

$9h,739.5h had not been.paid and said amount was awarded to
the tribe. The Cour

t of Claims indicated it would also .-._l'*-l on tie

on 39b, 739.57.: from J .e 15, 1851;, except there was no

tribe interest

-legal authority to do so.

In 192b, a bill was enacted to pay" the Omaha Tribe the interest .
which the Court of Claims had indicated it would pay had it the authority to so so, which was approved February 9,. 1925 (13 Stat. 820).

This
legislation provided for payment of the sum of $37h,h6§.02 to represent "mterest at 5 per cent“ on the amounts found due the Indians by
the aforesaid decision of the Court of Claims. By a later Actlreof Congress
approved March 3, 1926 (his, Stat. 17h), the smn of <"337h,h6§.02 was appropriated to pay said amount to the Omaha Tribe of Indians in accordance

with the Act: of Corwress

‘aw 

, approved February’ 9, 1925 -- that -is to repre-'
sent interest.

It was  no sense a payment on the purchase price of  - ‘th land. I

 The aforesaid acts shot»: that Congress was of the opinion that ‘comPensaition for the delay in payment of the ianount due and owing by the
defendant for saiduland for a period of 70“ years created -a moral. 'obli{,'ation on the part of the defendant, even though under the law there nas
1'10 3-Silfall doligation to compensate therefor. In the opinio_n of this Commission the said payment by the defendant government to the plaintiff

was not therefore in money expended by it "gratuitously" for the benef't

of the claimant, as contemplated by the Indian Claims Commission act.

we thiik that, while it was a pcyrue defendant was not
19-II€‘~ll_',r bound to pay, it was not a "5,.-. atuitous gii‘ t of the character

provided as possible offsets by the jurisdictional provisions of the
Indian Claims Commission.Act.

This Commission further feels that in View of the nature of pending
claim.of plaintiffs and the obligation recognized by Congress in.making
the $37h,h65.02 payment, that “good conscience" does not narr" t th
allowance by this Commission of said sum as anloffset, even if it should

be considered as a gratuity.
