5. Dr. Edward S. Chrtis in nis “The North American Indian" (1913),

The most powerful and warlike of all the Salish tribes
on the coast of Washington were the Clallan, a group comprising about a dozen populous villages on the southern
shore of the Strait of Juan de Fuca from Port Discovery
on the east to Hoke creek on the west, as well as some
settlements on the upper west coast of Ehidby island and

the southern shores of San Juan and Oroas islands. % % %

The Lummi, at the time of their first accurate observation by white men, held Lummi island and.the mainland
about Bellingham bay and Lummi bay, extending inland as
far as the site of Ferndale, Washington. an unusually
clear tradition related by a man born about the year 1820
sh ws that this tribe has been pushing slowly eastward

during the last no centuries.

This tradition states that early in the eighteenth.century the

C C O I ‘
Vvmmi, inhabising the islands of the San Juan group, began to desire a

'\

place on the mainland so that they would have a salmon stream and in

the war that resulted they almost exterminated the inhabitants of the
‘mainland and those who remained were assimilated by the Lummi.

Even as late as about 1830 the Lumni claimed, in
addition to the mainland from Chuchanut bay to Birch
bay, the following islands: Oroas, Elakely, Lopez
(on the north and the west coast). Shaw, San Juan
(except the west coast, and even that they held in
earlier days). Spieden, Stuart,'taldron, and all the

many islets in the waters thus defined.

6. In the Forty-first Annual Report of the Bureau of American
Ethnology (1919-192h) Appendix, is a nap drawn by Franz Boas, which
shows “The Distribution before lEOG," based on information collected by
James 3. Tait, Frans Boas, and Leo o. zraohtenherg; the name “Lummi“

In 1927, R. Erna Gunther published her "Klallam Ethno -aph' _,"
in which she stated (Def. V‘ . 110):

Curtis states t.at there were ‘£CLalla_rn. set uj..€IT...‘3IlL.-3 on
the upper west coast of ".-Ehidhy Island and on the southern
shores of San Juan and Crcas Islands. These have never
been mentioned to me. The lmations are directly across
the Straits from the Klallam territory and may at some
tine have been fishing stations. ‘F? if‘ it

A few years before 1850 a group of Klallam from Cla_l_lam
Bay, who always went to Lummi territory to fish, settled
there new Marietta. They intermarried with Luzrzmi and
received allotments there when the reservation was created.

In 1931;, B. J. Stern published his ethnology entitled, “The 

Indians of Northwest I-Fashington," in which he wrote as follows (Def.

Ex. 1:):

The Lunrni Indians who speak a Coast Salish dialect are
now settled on a reservation in northwest Trfashington near
the Canadian border, covering the area of their former rainland villages. In forrrer tines th 3; also ininabited the
shores of the San Juan Islands in Puget Sound and subsisted
on food obtained by fishing, hunting and plant gathering.

Stern also states at pages 126-127 of his ethnology:

' Members of the Lummi tribe fished with the reef net at
seven different sites: Tceltenem or Point Roberts;
Sqalekwcan or Village Point on Lnrrzzrj. Island; wtc ixom or
Bee Station north of Sandy Point; Tiqwologs or Point
Doughty on Orcas Island; Xoxolox, a point on Orcas Island
south of Freeman Island; Xwitcosang, in Upright Channel
south of Shaw Island; Szcoletc, a point on Lopez Island
opposite Lopez. -11- * -31Each of these locations , which contained enough frontage
on the lee side of the reef for as r.-zany as five nets , was
in

Q

owned and managed by “n _.-c-lvidual who was a direct de- scendant of the former owners.

Gibbs notes a finter village named Tonwhiksen on Hale ,
Passage (the channel between Lummi Island and the peninsula}. Curtis notes the same, others from the mouth of
the Eooksak River to Lummi Island, and one on Orcas Island
at West Sotnzd.

A.map of Lummi territory was published.hy Stern after
the foregoing was written. He assigns them a generous
section of the sound: on the mainland from above Bellingham to the international boundary (and bayond?); an indefinite extent inland on the Nooksak:Riyer; the whole of
Lummi, Orcas, Shaw, nd Haldron Islands; the northwestern.
side of Lopez Island and the eastern.shore of the San Juan;
Island; and the tip of Point Roberts on the peninsula south
of the Fraser mouth. Several.villages are indicated in the
gene al region of the mouth of the Rooksack River; one on
Orcas Islani at'Hest Sound; and one (named Seniamoo) on the

peninsula opposite Blaine. Fishins sites are as far flung

Stern‘s testimony would include as Lunmi, territory
‘which for the purposes of the present paper I prefer to
see set forth separately as that of the Lumni proper,
Iooksacic, and Swallah.

t is noteworthy that tern's wide Lummi territory does
not include the Sanish. Since Stern nowhere discusses
‘tribal composition.or territory, the divergences of his
views and those of earlier writers must go unresolved.

Swallah. t may not te proper to separate the Swallah
.from the Luani proper. Bells however gives it as a coordinate division: "the Swallah who lived on Orcas, (and)
San Juan (Islancis).“ This is clearly Mollet‘s Swalash.

in which he stated (Def. Ex. 88):

of Shaw and Oroas Islands, possibly haldron Island,

Bellingham and Lummi Bays, respectively. There me" have been a_so a
temporary settlement on or near the present site of maria

and perhaps one on Orcas Island. ;he situation on San Juan Islands, in
general, is not completely clear; San Juan Island itself was at least
visited seasonally by Indians from the'Washington mainland, as well as
by Indians from Canada.

In the autumn of 18LL, N. F. Tolnie, of the Hudson's Bay Company,
took a census of.‘ tie "various Indian tribes liv"in._:_-‘. on or near ?uget’s
Sound." Tolmie lists the "Nooh-lum-mi” with a total population of 2hh
(Dft. Ex. llb, p. b633, including 23 slaves (Dft. Ex. Bl, p. 12).

On October l3, 18b9, Joseph Lane, Superintendent of Indian P"fairs
for Oregon.Territory, reported (Dft. Ex. 131):

The Rooklulumic Indians live about Eallingham‘s Bay;
total number about 220; warlike; dispos'tion to the whites
not knot"; live by hunting and fishing.

On Septemlcr 16, l8Sh, Governor Stevens reported to the Commissioner

\

of Indicn affairs (Dft. Ex. llb, p. hS3, pp. h5L-h55):_

One cause of the over—estimate so frequently made of
Indians is their habit of moving about, gathering in bodies-one day'at one place, and in another the next--thus leaving
the impression of great numbers in each. % % W

Bel'e, the Skagits again occupying land on the main,
upon.the northern.end of Hhitby‘s island, Perry's island,
and the canoe passage, are three more tribes--the Squi-namish, Sno-da—nish, and Sin-a-ah-mish--probably 250 or 80

together; and lastly, the Sanish,_on the small.river of

that name, and the southern part of oellinghan bay, estimated at one hnndred.and fifty. dith these, according to
the best information procurable during a rapid journey of
inspection, the Nisoually nation terminates the next tribe
to the north speaking a dialect of the Clallam. It is probably that that of the Sanish is a hybrid between the two.

On Januajry 22, l85S, the Treaty oi‘ Point Elliott was signed by
"Chow-Iitshoot, Chief of the Lmrgni and other tribes“ and by representatives
of the United States (Dft. Ex. 182). It pro“ ided for four reservatiors

On June 15, 1856, settler Henry Welter wrote from San Juan Island

that there were "seven hundred Indians living on the island,“ (Dft. EX.

81, p. 37). No other information is given by Mr. Welter. If this statement is true, it probably refers to a snrrzzrer gathering of various groups.
On September 21, 1856, Agent C. C. Fitzhugh reported (Dft. ‘Ex. 80,

Indian agent E. C. Fitzhugh reported as follows on June l8, l8S7

From the commencement of the Indian War I have had under
my supervision three tribes of Indians, besides straggling
ones from.the back:country. The tribes are designated here
as the Eeuk-sack5 Samish, and Lummis, who were placed in my
charge together with a portion of the Neuksaers and Sia-man-nas,
who live in the back country on the lakes and streams adjacent.
The total number of all--men, women, and children»-estimated
at t*ael~.'e hnn&ed and fifty, dixided as follows: Neuk-sacks,
four hundred and fifty; Lummis, five hundred and ten; Samish,
one hundred and fifty; and the wticks, or Neukesers, and

Sia-man-nas, about two hundred.

The Lnmmis are divided into three bands—-a band for each
month oi the Lummi river-—ont all acknowledge Chow-ate-sot
to be their head; he is also the proper chief of their tribe.
They have also suffered much from the northern Indians. At
one time ‘hey were one of the most powerful tribes on the Sound,
claiming a large tract of the main land and numerous islands.
But, according to their can estimate, they no; number only be&QU

tween five and ix hundred total.

Agent J. R. Brown reported on.November l7, 1857 (R.C.I.A. l8S7,

There is but a small band of Indianszéesiding on the
island, a part of the Lumni tribe of Bellinnham Bay. The
Sanich.and Cowitchins, of Vancouver's island, th large
tribes, frequent it in great numbers during the fishing
season in summer. The Sanich are a tribe whose winter

camping grounds adjoin the town of Victoria.
In 1880, Auson.Dart, Superintendent of Indicn Affairs for Oregon

Territory, reported (Dft. Ex. 166, pp. 15420):

"Nooklummi . . . Bellinghams Bay and neighborhood . . .
222 . . . warlike . . . Mode of subsistence . . . Farming,

lb. A map showing the boundaries of the land claimed by the “Lumni

Tribe” and.the boundaries of land claimed by the "San Juan Tribe” was

Exhibit A-3 in the Dunamish case which was heard in 1926-1927. This map

is inconsistent with the present “Lunmi" claim and shows that the "Lunni"

\

a " ' _

claimed only the Lummi ?eninsula and L*1mi Island and part or the main»
land from Chuckanut Bay to Canada; the ”Lumni“ did not claim any of the
San Juan Islands; the “San Juan? clained.most of the San Juan Islands
(Dft. Ex. 26).

On June 21, 1927 t.e Secretary of'the Department of the Interior
wrote the Attorney General (B. 771 in F-275):

The Lurui Reservation was to consist of the island called
Chah-choc-sen in.the Lunni River. 520 acres of this island
were excluded from the reservation, but the area.was enlarged
to include 2,170 acres of the main land by Rx. Order of N re
32, 1573 (1 Kapp. 917), and 12,S60.9h acres were later allotted.
