STATEMENT

0n.December 29, 1955, this Commission determined that the Creek

Nation as it was constituted.on August 9, 181b, is entitled to recover of
the United States the value as of that date of 7,612,800 acres of land
in southern Georgia and 1,373,853 acres oi‘ land in Southeast Alabam,
said land corzzprising a tract described in the Commission's Finding of
Fact No. S8(a). At the same time the Commission determined that the
Nation may not recover for an additional adjoining 25,936,901 acres of

land lying in central and south-central Alabanja included in the Creek

cession to the United States on August 9, l8lh.
SUPPLEMENTAL FINDINGS OF FACTS

59. Prior to the execution of the cession oi‘ August 9, 18111, all
of Alabama except a tract ilzznediately north of Mobile Bay and west of
the Chickasawhay river, and the western two thirds of that part of the

state north of the Tennessee river was occupied by various Indian tribes.

6 Ind. 01. Com. 691 -692

Indian tribes also occupied all of Georgia except that part east of the
Ocmulgee and a strip about 50 miles wide along the coast south of the
Altamaha river. Florida, oaned.by Spain and occupied by dissidentrCreeks
and hostile Seminole Indians, extended along southern Georgia and Alabama westward to the Alabama river. ts acquisition.by the United States%
at an early date was anticipated., (Trans. 98h) '

The land ceded.by the Greeks Nation in l8lh formed an.L shaped.tract
which included central and southeast Alabama.and southern Georgia, exe
tending from.Wayne county, Georgia, to the land betaeen.the Alabama and
Tombigbee rivers ceded to the United States by the Choctaw Indians in
l802 and.l805. North of it was unceded Greek territory and south of it
‘was Florida. The area under valuation at this time lies within the base
of this L, and comprises the southeastern corner of the Alabama land and
all of that in Georgia.

60. Under its proprietary charter of 1732 Georgia originally claimed
all land between the Altamaha and Savannah rivers from the Atlantic coast
‘west to the "South Seas." As a consideration for Georgia ceding its
claim.to all that land.west of the Chattahoochee river on.April 2h, l8C2,
the United States contracted in an.instrument called "Articles of Agree:ment and Cession" to pay $1,250,000 to satisiy claims arising under
Gedrgia's previous transfers of a part of the land, and to:

* %=% at their own expense, extinguish for the use of Georgia, as

early'as the sane can be peacably obtained, on.reasonahle terms,

the Indian title go e-a-e all other lands within the State of

Georgia. - House Hisc. Doc., Vol. 19, p. 80 See also 1, Stat. 5&9,

Georgia immediately'vested in that state upon.ratification of the Trad

of August 9, l8lh, and became subject to the land laws of that State.

Physical Characteristics

61. The Creek ceded lands in Georgia may be roughly divided into
three sections. The Lower Coastal Plain almost covers the eastern half
of the area under valuation. The soil is generally sandy, ranging from
light gray to dark gray and black fine loamy sand. Drainage ranges from
exessive, poor, fair to good. The land is fairly level. The Middle
coastal Plain is generally upland, well drained with soil ranging from
poor, fair to good. It is dandy loam and clays. These two regions are
known as the "Pine Barrens“. The northwest corner of the tract and an
area i.n the southern portion of the western half lies in the Upper Coastal Plain. The soils are sandy loams and learns, and are much more fertile
than those in the lower regions. The greater portion of the Alabama
part of.‘ the tract under valuation lies within this province. The extreme
southeast corner is in the Middle Coastal Plain, and the northwesttip
reaches into the Clay Hills region. There are appro@.ately, 3 ,700,C00
acres in the Lower Coastal Plain which is also known as the Coastal Terrace, 1,850,000 acres in the Middle Coastad. Plain which is also knOT.~II1 as
the Tifton Uplands, 1,665,000 acres in the Upper Coastal Plain which is
also known as the Dougherty Plain, in Georgia, and b.0C,73S acres in the
Okefenokee Swamp area. Nowhere does the elevation of the tract under

valuation exceed I400 feet. It produces such diversified crops as corn,

cotton, peanuts, tobacco, vegetables and fruit. Cattle, swine, sheep and_

horses thrive on the pine grass.

62. The Okefenokee S1-ramp encompasses about l'.C‘0,735 acres in the

6 Ind. Cl. Corn. 691 -6924

southeast corner of the area under valuation. t is about l26 feet, above
sea level on the northeast and lll feet above on the southeast. The eastern side is characterized by wide sheets of shallow’ water called prairies,
which are covered with lilies. There are clumps or islands of cypress
trees and l'=.-I-lying ridges that have palmetto and pine. Toward the center
there are several deep water lakes. The western side of the swamp is
heavily forested with cypress, tupelo and oak, with pine on the higher
portions. Holly, magnolia, black gum and yaupom are found in lesser
amounts. The soil‘ is soft spongy" muck, which is exceedingly fertile.
There are a few sandy fields along the western fringe.

Georgia surveyed the swamp in 1890 and offered the land for sale
at l2-'f,_= cents per acre. It sold in l89l_ to the Suwanee Canal Company at
26%¢ per acre, the Company’ intending to drain it and harvest the timber.
The project failed but later 'bI‘E‘-.II".1iJ1€*S were built into the trees and
much of the timber has I10‘.-I been cut. 325,000,000 board feet of cypress,
approximately 700,000 board feet of cypress crossties, 98,000,000 board
feet of pine and 600,000 board feet of other lumber has been removed
since, 1908. The stanchng timber was valued at $1,169,000.00 by John 1-3..
Hopkins, writing for the Georgia Society of Naturalist in 1915. The
United States at present maintains a wild life refuge over most of the
area.

63. E*ith;'m the area under valuation precipitation ranges from 1:8 to
56 inches annually. The temperature averages 500 in January and the lo'»~:er
805 during July. There are few freezes and snow is rare. The growing

season lasts 2L».o to 26o days. The climate is considered to be mild and

healthy.

6 Ind. Cl. Com 691 ‘ -695

(a) The Great and Little Satilla rivers which unite east of the
area, drain the northeast corner of it. The Okefenokee Swamp gives rise
to the St. N rye’ and Suwanee rivers. I’.-oving westward, the land is drained
by the Suwanochee, tfmachoochee, Alapaha and Little rivers, tributaries of the Suwanee, by the Ochloclcnee, Otilla, and the Chattahoochee watersystem consisting of the Spring, Flint, and Chipola, which becomes the
Apalachicola river in Florida. The western section of the Alafoama land
is drained by the Choctawatchee and its tributaries, the Pea and Holmes
rivers. All drainage is south to the Gulf of I-iexico through what was
in l8lh and until 1819 Spanish owned Florida, except the Satillas and
St. Marys rivers which flow east into the Atlantic ocean.

Northern Alabama is drained by the Tennessee river. The Conecuh
river rises near the northwest corner of the area under valuation and
flows southwest to the Gulf of Mexico, becoming the Escambia river in
Florida. The :3;LabaIr.a river and its tribxtaries, the Black Warrior, Tombigbee, Tensaw, Coosa and Talapoosa, drain the rest of Alabama. The
Altamaha and its tributaries, ‘the Ocmulgee, Oconee and Ohoopee rivers ,

drain central Georgia, passing about ten miles northeast of the land unuh

der valuat ion.
Natural Resources

6b,. The land under valuation lies in the outer fringe of the Great»
Pine Belt which extends in a crescent from Chesapeake Bay to Lake Ponchartrain, with separate forests in Louisiana and Texas. (P. <3: I. 363:.
71:, pa 79) The eastern section produces the long leaf and slash piillés

‘th some cypress. Loblolly pine and hardwoods pre®rrLinate in southern

and northern sections of western Georgia and long leaf and slash pine

6 Ind. Cl. Com. 691 696

predominate in the west central section and in the southern.Alabama area.
Loblolly and short leaf pine cover the balance of the Alabama land with
oak near the headwaters of the Conecuh river in Alabama. The Okefenokee
swamp produces principally cypress and hardwoods. Saw palmetto, pine,
gum, magnolia, red, white and water oak, beech, ash, poplar, maple and
bay trees, and a few other types also appear. Cypress to some extent

is found in nearly all parts of the tract, growing in undrained stagnent pools. Forest fires occurred on an average of h to a decade in the
early'l800‘s. (Trans. 62?)

(a) In l8lh the Alabama tract contained an average timber stand of
7,000 board feet per acre, of which 65% was long leaf or yellow pine, and
35% mixed.hardnoods. The Georgia land bore an average stand of long leaf
pine of h,0C0 to 7,000 board feet per acre. It is estimated there were
2,000,000 acres of hardwood, which represented first class land and
2l8,000 acres of cypress and 5,000,000 acres of yellow pine, which.represented second and third.class land, within the tract.

(b) ZDuring the early l9th centuny southern.yellow pine, which is
especially fine grained, and Georgia live oak, ;which was considered of
superior quality, were in great demand for ship construction in the
United States, the West Indies, and in Great Britian. The French Botan»
ist, Eiehaux, in a treatise pnblished between 1810 and l8l3,'wrote:

The long leaved pine is the only species exported.from the

Southern.States to the'West IndieS.** The stuff destined

for the colonial markets is cut into ever" form:required in

the construction of houses and vessels. hhat is sent to England r-% are s0ld_at $8 to $10 a hundred cubic feet, * * ‘

‘where it is said to be employed in the building 05 3hiP§ 3”“

‘wet docks. It is called Georgia pitch pine, and sold 2; to

30 per cent higher than any other pine imported.from the Cnitzd
States.

6 Ind. Cl. Con. 691 69?

"Naval stores” or pine tar , turpentine, pitch, resin and wooden
staves were also prodnced. About l8lh live oak was being cut on the islands o.‘Z‘f the coast oi‘ Georgia and along the shore about the mouth of the
Mississippi. The recerd does not show live oak grew upon the land under
valuation in any extensive quantity. (P. & I. Ex. 69, p. 9, 66, 661)

(c) While the pelts were not prime, fur bearing animals such as
racoon, opossum, mink, wolf, wildcat, panther, bear and beaver, as well
as quail, geese, duck squirrel and rabbit were plentiibl. The United
States Commissioner was advised in l789 that the Creek Nation had that
year traded furs to the value of 10,000 pounds sterling or $5,350 ‘B0 the
Spaniards in Florida. (Pet. Eats. 22; 107, p. 20) The Okefenokee Swamp
and its environs produced fish, berries and honey and were especially valuable hunting grounds for alligators and other animals. Furs
and hides obtained 1-rithin this area in 1921; amounted to $150,000.

(6.) The Creeks raised cattle, hogs and sheep and grew some cotton
about their townsites. The area was prior to its cession to the United
States used principally for hunting and grazing purposes.

(e) While iron -ore was being mined in the adjoining .éLLabama land
ceded by the Creeks in 1811;, there is no evidence of mineral values in
the area under valuation.

65. Some 300 £r=_=_=ericans, Spaniards and other 1-mites lived with

4"
Athe Creek Nation as early as 1790- (Def. Ex. 95, Pa 1511) The 9:135": 3
such persons living within the area under valuation in 1814 is not known.

Three trading posts were operating within the area and two were directly
north in Georgia, all run by whites or halfbreeds. The Creeks had several

towns along the Flint river in the north and one beside it in the south

of the area. They had a town near the Okefenokee Swamp and a number

6 Ind. Cl. Com 691 698

along the Chattahoochee river in Georgia, as well as several along that
river in Alabarr . In Florida and particularly along the west bank of the
Chattahoochee river there were several SezIf.inole Indian villages in 18lh.

In 1811; there were white settlements along the Tennessee river in
northern Alabama and in the area along the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers
which the Choctaw ceded in 1801 and 1805. Mobile with a population of
500 when the United States acquired Mobile Province in 1813, St. Stephens
Blakeney were settlements in southwestern Alabama, more than a hundred
miles west of the tract under consideration. Fort Barrington and Darien
on the Altamaha river and Savannah on the Savannah river in settled Georgia were important ports. Between them was Sl3.I1b1JI'}", on the longest road
to the north m Georgia. St. Marys, Centerville and Traders Hill were
towns on the St. Marys river. St. Marks, St. Augustine and Pensacola
were shipping points in Spanish Florida.

(a) Several well-known Indian trails crossed the area under valuationin 18114. They ran north and south along the Flint  Chattahoochee
rivers, crossed the northeastern section of the tract running from the St.
Marys river to Indian towns on the Chattahoochee near the present site of
Columbus. One trail from Miccosuki Lake near Tallahassee, Florida, ran
past Valdosta, Georgia, and south of the Okefenokee S:-ramp to the St.
I"1aI'ys. Trails connected with roads in Georgia to the east, and nu:ne:;xx;t
traces or trails ran across the land north of this tract. In 1805, 7 S
Stat. 95, the Creek Nation granted permission for white travel along a
trail running north of this tract, through Fort Hawkins (Macon), Georgi»
westward to Cusseta on the Chattahoochee, through Forts Mitchell, Bainm
bridge and Mims in Alabama, down to Mobile. In 1811 this was widened

for vehicular traffic and known as the Federal Road- The United Sta:

6 Ind. Cl. Com. 691 699

also operated a postal route between Athens and Coweta, but with the exception of the Federal Road these trails were merely horsepaths in August
l8l1;. The C—overnnent‘s military forces during the Creek War and while moving against dissident Greeks and Seminoles in Florida before the purchase
of that country in l8l9, out a number of trails through Creek county and
the area under valuation which were later transportation roads. Among
these were the two Bradsheer roads, each cut in the fall of l8ll;.

(b) Permission for passage over Creek territory was granted the
United States in the Creek treaty of August 9, 1811;.

(c) The Steamboat was not used in this region until l8l9. The

several large streams within and about the area under valuation appeared

to offer good transportation potentials in l8lh. They were subject,
however, to sunken logs, sand bars, shoals, and overhanging trees which
make poling a boat difficult. A serious deterrent to using those strear
flowing into the Gulf of I-Eexico was their course through Spanish owned
Florida where hostile Indians were a constant menace and heavy duties
were assessed. Hostile Greeks and Seminoles from Florida harrassed surveying parties and squatters and settlers within the tract under valuation until after 1835. (Trans. p. 789)

The Choctawatchee and Escanbia rivers flowed into Pensacola Bay, an
excellent port, and were navigated by rafts and small boats as far as
Newton, Alabama. Navigation on the Chattahoochee extended through the
subject tract, and as far as Bainbridge on the Flint river, but in high
water stearziboats later ran to £L'Lbany. Silting about the mouth of the
Apalachicola made the trmsfer of commerce from river craft to ocean

going vessels difficult, but in l8lh this waterway carried commerce to

6 Ind. Cl. Com. 691 V 700

and from the area under valuation. The Ochlocknee and the Suwanee. rivers
were not navigable within the area. Rafts and small boats went up the
Sat:'i_lla river to Waycross, within the area, (Trans. p. lOl:9) and up the
St. Marys as far as Traders Hill, which is some 10 miles overland and east
of the tract.

Outside of the tract under valuation, navigation extended up the
Conecuh slightly north of Florida; up the Alabama and Coosa as far as
Wetumpkas, and up the Talapoosa about 35 miles above that point. The
Altamaha, the Oconee and Ocmulgee were navigable for a hundred miles or
so, but were separated from this tract by a strip of land which was not
ceded by the Creek Nation until l8l8.

The record does not disclose how much farther beyond the point of
navigation termination these streams were driveable for logs, or when
they were first so used.

66. The close of the War of 1812 precipitated a western Irnlgation
from the settled eastern states. Settlers arriving in Alabama and Western Georgia came principally from North and South Carolina, Virginia and
Tennessee by way of the Tennessee river valley to the Muscle Shoals.
When the Land Office opened at Huntsville, Alabama, in 1810, within the
area where Indian title had been extinguished in 1808, emigrants flocked
into that region. The opening of the Federal Road to vehicular traffic
in l8ll signaled migration to the . Toxnbigbee-Alabama river country where
Indian title was extinguished in 1802 and 1805- An emigrant trail from
the Muscle Shoal of the Tennessee river ran north and west of the land
under valuation, through the northern tip of the Creek cession of l8lh,
to that area. Although the Creek Nation complained bitterly of encroachments upon their land east of that region, the tide of emigration turned

6 Ind. 01. Com. 691 ' 7CD.

east, and southeastern Alabaua was settled by people from the Tombigbee£L'Labama river country.
The rapid rate of settlement within Georgia, Alabama and neighboring states is reflected in the following table: (Def. Ex. 95, p. 160, P.

(a) Georgia Land
The Georgia land under valuation and a tract adjoining it on the

north which the Creek Nation ceded during 1818, were divided into the

counties of Early, Irwin and Appling and offered for settlement in 1820 ,

under the Lottery Act of 1818. By 1830 theusame area had been _ subdivided into several counties. The 1820 population of the original‘ counties
and the 1830 population of the same area is given below, tbgether with
the population of ‘rIilkiI1son and Baldwin counties, which were established
within the area between the Oconee and Ocmulgee rivers which land was
ceded by the Creek Nation in 1802 and 1805: (Trans. p. 731) The figures include slaves.

(b) Alabama Lgnd.

The area of Alabama land now under valuation was within Monroe
County wmn it was created in 1815. Migration to the country about Fort
Jackson was exceptionally heavy. In 1816 Montgomery County was formed
in the north and Henry county was created in 1819, including in its
borders all but the north tip of the subject land. This tract I101-I lies

in Houston and Henry counties, the western portions of Dale and Geneva

counties, most of Barbour county and the southeast corner of Bullock

county. 3055 of a1abama‘s poplilation in 1820 were slaves; 38% of the
1830 population were slaves. The dates of creation and population on

various dates of those counties within this nea follows:

67. The close of the War of 1812 sparked one of the four greatest
inflationary periods in the history of this country. Foreign trade

was immediately resumed. Cotton which had brought 22¢ per pound between

8 1791: and 1811, fell to 10%;; in 1812 but rebounded to 30¢ in 1816 and 3h¢

by 1818. A rush for western land resulted in inflationary prices for
cotton producing land after 18111. State banks, of which Georgia had 2
in 18114, circulated theh own currency, and the state was "infested with
a plethora of financial instruzzzents, like ‘bills of credit‘ that were
issued by individuals, partnerships, and various associations" according to the witness, Starrett. (Def. Ex. 95. p. 1111) The Second Bank of

6 Ind. Cl. Com. 691 703

the United States which was chartered in 1816, circulated its notes largely
in the southern states, and before l820 many new state banks were chartered in the country, all conducive to heavy land speculation. In addition, the first chance afforded the holders of $5,000,000 of Mississippi
scrip which had been issued in settlement of claims to the western land
ceded by Georgia in 1802, was the Alabama lends sales of 1.817 and l8l8.
This scrip was applicable on land purchases at the rate of $95.00 scrip

to $5.00 cash, but on January 6, 1818, it sold at $68.00 in New York.

(P. 8: I. Ex. 8, pp. 50-2)

The speculative period terminated with l8l9. Cotton fell to 18¢
per pound in 1820, lh¢ in l82l and 11¢ in 1823. Congress abolished
credit land sales, and passed numerous relief acts for previous purchasers. Land not paid for could be relinquished, the money paid credited
to other purchases. Balanc-Ies owing were reduced as much as 3% and extensions were ganted. Those relinquishing land for credit on other
purchases, however, continued to claim the entire amount and either competed with or paid speculators not to bid for land they had cleared and
cultivated. Congress eventually granted these relinquishers the right to
repurchase for 37%.’: of the original price.

Most of the river bottom lands in Alabama were sold by 1820. Ba.-:.-‘rc
country tracts, being relatively inaccessible, did not command prices

I

much in excess of the minimum statutory price, but nevertheless “seal; -2:’:-'~
also prayed upon squatters who had improved tracts in the h0P° °f 3""‘"“
purchases, and auctions were often suspended where such practicw W3"-’
evident. ( P. & I. F:-:. 8, pp. 55, 65)

68. Prior to April 2h, 1820, the public domain sold at public

6 Ind. 01. Com. 691 701

auction for a minimum 32 per acre on 3.1,-year credit terms and discounts
which reduced the price to $1.67 per acre cash. Southern land sales
began with the opening of the St. Stephens Land Office in 1866 and

the sale of 11,125 acres in southeast Mississippi the first year. (Trans.
p. 13h5) The Huntsville Land Office covering land in the rich valleyof the Tennessee river opened in north Alabama in 1810. The Mi.1ledgevi_'l_1e
Office with jurisdiction over central Alabama opened in 1817 and moved
to Cahaba, Alabama, in 1819. The Sparta Land Office district, covering
the land under valuation, had better water resources, greater potentials
for stock raising, superior forest to the Cahaba District and was 50%
agricultural; but Cahaba lands had better transportation and were 60%

agricultural. Within the years stated, land in these northern districts

sold as f ollows:

Speculators paid from $50 to $70 per acre in a few instances for
Tennessee river country, and from 3.320 to $30 for ordinary cotton lf1:r<-3 1!‘1818 , but turned in over 331-,OO0,000 of Mississippi scrip in 983'?“-933""

The l_,S30,98S.7h acres selling in the Cahaba District bctwct:-I1 371'?

and 1821 for an average $3.56 per acre had $60l,h29.97 of I»Iissi315iE'-Eli

scrip applied on the purchase price. 6119,20?-15 acres were 333339“ L”“:"‘

6 Ind. C1. Com. 691 705

for credit on other purchases. Throughout the state l,S86,376.'?8 acres
were surrendered for a credit of $7,801,873.51. The location of these
sales with respect to rivers, roads, trails, distance from settlements in
Tennessee, and the extent of improvement, is not in evidence. Since
these were government sales, improvements would have been limited to such
as squatters having no secured claim to the land, might erect.

(a? I-iuch land sold at depressed prices as the result of combines
of speculators. One auction was closed by the Commissioner in 1817 when
only $2 per acre bids were forthcoming. In two townships land for which
the government received $2 per acre in l8l9 immediately sold for an average $S.L\3 per acre. (P. & I. Ex. 3, p. 600)

69. In 1817 surveys began within thecreek cession of 18114. The
land about Montgomery, at the edge of the Black Belt and on the headwaters of the Alabama river containing some of the best soil in the state,
lying within 11: miles of the northwest corner of the subject tract sold
first. Indian trails from all directions led into the area; the Federal
Road passed through it. Between 1817 and 1821 35' townships or approximately 805,000 acres, were offered for sale and 311,230 were sold.

(Def. Ex. 95, p. 202) In l5 of these townships no sale exceeded the then
statutory minmm of $2 per acre. Only 3070 Of all 1,555 Sales realized
in excess of that sum but some brought $30 ‘=30 $50 per acre. The i1IIPI‘0V 9"
ments made by squatters and the location of these tracts with respect to
river bottom lands and the Federal Road is not evidenced.

70. The land under valuation was surveyed in 1822 and 18211. It

was not offered for sale until. 1827. (Trans. p. 892) Of the 63 Wm6 Ind. 01. Com. 706

ships wholly or partially within this tract, 23 had no sales before 1830
and 8 southern townships had none before 1850, 35 years after the valuetion date. The price realized was almost uniformly the then statutory
 of $1.25 per acre. (Def. Ex. 95, Ex. K, Fig. 2) The census
records disclose that 2,638 squatters were within this area by 1820 and
that 14,020 people were there in 1830. (Fdg. No. 65(5))

71. Pr-eferring a larger population to retaining its public land,
Georgia offered its land f or sale originally for payment of transfer
fees. Later it adoped a lottery system, the participants limited to
state resident. The public land was surveyed, divided into 202% acre
lots or larger, dependent upon quality (Trans. p. 7511), each lot num bered and public drawings held throughout short periods of time.
Fractional lots were separately disposed of. The Act of May 11, 1803,
which introduced the system, required payments of $9.00 fees and $1.00
per acre for first quality river lend; 37.00 fees and 50¢ per acre for
second quality river and first quality upland; $14.00 fees and 25¢ per
acre for second quality upland; $2.00 fees and 12-§—¢ per acre for third
quality upland; 50¢ and 6—};¢ per acre for pine land. June 26, 1806,
the fees were fixed at $6.00 per 100 acres. (Trans. p. 757) Subsequent
acts extended final payment dates to April 15, 1815. Thereafter all ungranted lots were available at $100. per lot, plus filing fees, until
June 1, 1815; at $508 per lot plus fees from June 1 to August 1, 1815;
at $25.00 per lot plus fees from August 1, to October 1, 183.5, and after

October 1, 1815 for mere payment of fees. Bottom lands were considered

6 Ind, Cl. Corn 691 707

the most valuable.

72. Wayne County adjoins the land under valuation on the east, and
is that elongated tract purchased of the Creek Nation in 1802. Baldwin
county and Wilkinson county comprise the two tracts about 10 miles north
of the subject land, between the Ocmulgee and Oconee rivers, which were
ceded by the Creeks in 1802 and 1805. Lots in these counties were offered
in 1505 and 1807. The number of lots offered, their size, the lottery
date, the number of lots reverting to the state, are reflected in the

Northern Wilkinson and Baldwin counties are within the Dougherty
Plains. The remainder of these counties and all of Wayne county fall in
the Tifton Upland or pine region. By 1811; an of the 3,315,000 acres
offered in these two lotteries had been taken up except for 604,665 acres

in the Tifton Uplands. 88,897.50 acres were taken up in 1828, 26h,8?O

offered could have been obtained immediately upon payment of the statutory fees recited in the above tables.

73. All of the land under valuation lying in Georgia was disposed
or under the Lottery Act of December 15, 1818. The drawer paid $518.00
per lot, regardless of the acreage involved. He was required to have
resided within the state three years. (Trans. p. 758) James Etheridge
Callaway in his Early Settlement of Georgia, (P. 3.: I. Ex. 55, p. llS)
said:

The legislature showed so little interest in the new acquisition that it waited four years before it divided the land into counties; finally in 1818, the three huge cnunties of Early,

Irwinand Appling were laid off. The lots were larger than

the regulation 2C2¢ acres; Early, which bordered the Chattahoochee and through which ran the Flint, was divided into lots

of 250 acres; Appling and Irwin were considered even less desirable and were divided into lots of 1190 acres each. By 1820

six years after the cession, the entire territory had a total

population of only 2,hh3, and over half of this was in Appling

which was the least fertile of all but nearest the territory 8

then possessed by the State.

(8.) Before December, l8hO, 9,1198 lots were dramin Early county,
and 2,310 reverted to the state. h,36O lots were drawn in Appling county
by that date and 3, 001 of them reverted. 5,303 lots were ch~awn in I_:~w$;1
county and 2,078 reverted to the state. During this period Georgia's
legislature reduced the fee per lot in gradual stages from $18 to $5 
land lot a;_fter December 25, 1837. (Def. Br. p. 96) and extended the

original two year maturity period until September .1, l8h0. Sixty per
cent of all final sales fell in the $5.00 per lot class, costing the

purchaser 02¢ per acre for land in Early county and less than ls‘. per

(b) The reverted lots were offered under the Act of December 9,

18140, which fixed the following prices I-.-ith rega-d to acres involved: (Trans., p. ll23)

(C) An estimated 218,800 acres lying within the Okefenokee
SI-ramp was not considered salable, and no effort was made to dispose of
it under the aforementioned Lottery Acts.

7h. Frational lots were sold in 18.9.1 under the following limitations: (P. & I. Ex. 22)

75. Petitioners and Intervenors Exhibit No. 113 contains data extracted from the records of the present counties of Irwin, Decatur and
Early, and shows all sales between individuals which occurred in those
counties between 1821 and some time in 1825. Irwin county lies in the
north central part of the area under valuation; Early county lies along
the western border and Decatur county is in the southwest corner. The
Chattahoochee river borders Early and Decatur county; the Spring and
Flint rivers unite with the Chattahoochee in Decatur county, and the
Satilla and Alapaha rivers flow through Irwin county. With but five
exceptions Messrs Thompson and Coulter, who prepared this exhibit, were
unable to ascertain whether the conveyed lands were improved. -Such improvements as may have existed were either erected by squatters or after the lotteries opened in 1818, and would have had a limited value.
Disregarding forced aw. partial interest sales, there were 103 sales
in Decatur county, 221 sales in Early county and 61; sales in Irwin
county which showed both acreage and consideration involved. The average recited consideration in these transfers in Decatur country was
531-30 per acre; that in Early county averaged $1.56 per acre, and that
in Inrin county was but 61 cents per acre.

76. Over 1,000,000 acres south of the Ocmulgee and .+'Llt:m.3h-'1 1"-5‘-" 73:
adjacent to the land under valuation, ceded by the Creek Nation r.Er.:*:‘.:'.‘_:

Irwin county, l,l88 reverted. Again 66% of the lots sold for the reduced
P1"iCE3 Of $5.00 per land lot. The reverted lots were again offered under
the Act of December 9, l8hC, and were sold for but one cent per acre.
These laid ‘.2-:ithi_n the Coastal Terrace and Tifton Upland regions.

Other land acquired of the Creek Nation on January 22, l8l7, lying
in Walton and Gwinnett counties, between Atlanta and Athens, sold in
250-acre tracts during 1820 under the l8l8 Lottery Act. Of 1,935 lots
then offered, none reverted but 6% of then sold at $5.00 per land lot.

77. The parties agree that the land under valuation as of August
9, 18115 was best adapted to subsistence farming and cattle gazing.
Settlers grazed cattle on the I-riregrass or pine grass under the trees,
in the canebrakes and on the young saT.~.r-palmetto. Their hogs roamed at
large, feeding upon nuts, roots and acorns. They cleared small acres by
girdling trees and planting around the deadened roots. With miles of
forest, on three sides, and in Spanish Florida , the timber possessed a
future potential value but no recognized present value beyond its use
for buildings and fences, even as late as 1830.

Fare in Georgia during the thirties was carried on with an '

eye to immediate profits. There was no need to spend time and

money improving the land. In the spirit of the coal miner who

seizes upon the richest vein first, Georgia planters and farII':ers left the older country and burned up million of dollars,

in timber to grow other minions of dollars worth of cotton.

The cotton would sell in markets around the world; the ti1'a'i?C-I‘
was simply an obstruction to the achievement of their short9'‘

sighted ends. — The Georgia Historical. Quarterly, Vol. }I..T.I'.'., ;-229.

Georgia had one sawmill in 1810, producing an annual average 1,252,000
board feet of lumber. There were three mills in the state by 1816, one
at Savannah on the Savannah river, one at St. Marys on the St. Iviarys
river and the third at Darien on the Altanaha, each mill east of the
area under valuation some 70, 35 and 35' miles, respectively. The first
reference to sawmills within Alabara reports six about to go into operation near I-Zozltgomery in 1816, around 60 miles northwest of this tract.
The state had 10 mills in 1820, 6 of them in Monroe county along the Alabama-Tombigbee rivers. Georgia produced 3325,1400 worth of lumber in 1810
and $1ll;,0S0 in 1839. Mabama produced $169,008 worth of lurrber in 1839.

The record does not establish when commercial tirber was first cut
within the area under valuation or that the timber stand in Georgia or
Alabama was nearing exhaustion m 18114. ‘ahile the price is not shown,
one of the greatest lmzbering operations of all time began with the purchase in 18314 of 700,000 acres of timber, predominately yellow pine, between the Ocmulgee and Oconee rivers about 15 miles north of the subject
tract. Four z:1i_'1ls and 18 saws were used in preparing that timber for
traxlsportation down the Altamaha river to the mill at Darien. (P- 51 1'
EX. J46, p. 265) There were no-stumpage sales prior to 1880.

78. Contemporary comments concerning the land ceded by the Cree}:
18331011 in 1311*. express conflicting views. Colonel William Barnett, cm:
Of the Comulssioners appointed to survey the Creek lines in 1811;, coermented of the land east of the Flint river:

Agent Efilliazn Darby in his "Emigrant‘s Guide" ptmlished in 1818,
quoted one W. Roberts concerning the entire cession:

Judging of the interior of the country from what has been seen
on its boundaries and the roads passing through it, except what
lies between Flint river and Chattahoochee, all the rest could
not be sold for shat it would cost the state to survey it  

From Chattahoochee on the line to Flint river, there is about

a third of the distance good land. it -39 Thence to Flint river the
land is generally fine, soft, gray land, well timbered and near
the river, of a rich soil -‘-1' 

Proceeding from the line down towards the point (junction of
Flint and Chattahoochee rivers), I am told that the proportion
of good‘ land increases; but be the proportion of good land more
or less, * '33’ it is the only part of the whole tract received

Colonel Hawkins, Creek Indian Agent, described the northern tip of
the Alabama land under valuation as havmg pine forests, containing

broken oak land, with reedy glades and rich bottom and hill land, fit

for cultivation. Henry Freeman, Deputy Chief Land Commissioner, advis-» A

ed Land Commissioner I-Ieigs in l8l6 that:

“I do not expect that there will be one whole Township sectioned trlthin 30. Imlles of the spanish bound? Line between the

General Andrew Jackson, who dealt in lands in northern Alabama
recomnenied in his letter to General Pickney on May 18, 1811:, that the
ceded land be made available to his soldiers, those "who conquored it“,
at $2 an acre, a suggestion which he repeated in a letter to the Secretary of War on August 10, 181b,. (P. & I. ha. 31, p. 35 32 p. 793)

79. James M. Stauffer, Alabama State Forester, testified from an
examination of field notes made during the 1822 survey and his personal
knowledge of the Alabama land. He estimated in 1811: the tract in Alabama had an average stand of 14,500 board feet per acre of pine worth
$182 and 2,150 board feet of hardwood worth $214.50 per acre at present
prices. By discounting those figures at 3% compound interest for 1113
years, he fixed a value of $2.09 per acre on the standing tinber in 1811;.
He stated this rate was customary in computing potential values in
forestry. Using 11% interest, his 18111 value was 79.3¢ per acre and with
6% it became 0S.2¢ per acre. The expense of preparing stumpage for milling would run, he said about $100 per thousand board feet, and he thought
it would cut 8,000 board feet per acre.

W. H. Hccomb, division head of Georgia's Forestry Commission, estimated the pine stand in 1811; in the Georgiautract averaged 5,000 or from
h,000 to 7,000 board feet per acre and that the pine and cypress was
worth 82.50 per acre, based upon prices then paid by the Navy Department,
but was uncertain whether those prices applied in the forest or at the
mill. He considered standing tixrberworth 11% to 15% the market value
of the lumber it produces; (Lid not know what streams in the area were or

could be used to drive logs in 1-811;, but considered that all the timber

6 Ind. C1. Com. 691 715

was accessible. He relied upon data given in the l82O census of Jones
Cour‘-t3’: T-=3'1ich the author of the article in which it is set out considered
unreliable. (P. e  ac. 79, p. 197)

Paul Starrett, a witness f.‘ or defendant, an appraiser of 29 years
exPe3°ienCe: h<"—Vi1'1g exarrined the tract and investigated pertinent data,
thought that a potential purchaser in l8lh would have considered the

the Ge°1‘8ia Act Of 1803 (Fdg. of Fact No. 71), and usinc l.66S.OO0 a

for computation purposes, he concluded a purchaser would have anticipated
a gross resale revenue of $550,000; that under accepted standards he
could pay 1/ 3 for raw land, or $213,090; that surveying meme in Georgia ran Ol.S¢ per acre or $25,000; that sale preparation would consume
tW° Years time during which period 6% interest on the original invest.
ment W0“-Ld C0313 $23,560; that at least ten years would be required to
move the land, and interest during that period computed at 3373 to allow
for reductions as sales were made, would amount to ff»6h,OOO3 that 10%
°f the Proceeds would be a reasonable sales expense, and the resulting
116% Profit would not be considered attractifre in view of the risk in.
volved. According to Starrett‘s computation, the original cost to the
purchaser would amount to about 1335;? per acre,

Sterrett also referred to several large-tract sales as reflecting
the mark"-‘3"0 ‘Oren _, Qt rough not comparable for appraisal purposes. These
included C‘e°1‘€ia‘s efforts to sell its western lands, transfers between
individuals of some of that land prior to 1800, and transfers of l.::.::.:ctracts in Florida occurring between l8C'6 and 1.818 for credit upon c:—:.:Ls ting debts at from (36.6% per acre to h2¢ per acre.

Starrett gave the land under consideration a $385,000 value as oi‘
August 9, 1311;. This represented a 02.S¢ per acre value on 3 ,700,000
acres oi‘ Coastal Terrace land andavalue oi‘ 6'; per acre upon all the
rest of the land  this tract except the Okefenokee S-samp area which
he considered was then worthless. He thought Georgia's land policries
as expressed by the l8C-3 Legislative Act represented the attitude of
the people toward this land and that any value fixed upon it --would have
to be less than those values fixed by the l803 Act in order for it to
attract pin’-chasers.

80. It appears that tm Georgia Legislature passed several acts
prior to 1802 attempting to sell the western land claimed by that state.
In 1789 it offered all land north of latitude 31° 11.5‘ between the Tombigbee and iiississippi rivers for slightly over one cent per acre, payable in specie. Six years later it tendered 35,000,000 acres lying north
and west of 1-iontgomery, Alabama, within 100 miles oi‘ the tract under
valuation, to four purchasers i‘or2-3‘.-3-g2S per acre. within a month‘s time
one of the grantees purported to sell ll,380,000 acres in south central
Mississippi and western Alabama for 10¢ per acre. Another txmed
lO9,61LO acres in northern Mississippi during l799 for credit -upon an.
indebtedness at 33¢ per acre. Two townships near Demopolis, Mabama,
just east oi‘ the Tombigbee river, were granted a group of French inadgrants at 232.00 per acre on crecdt terms of 111 years by the Federal Covernment during l8l7.
