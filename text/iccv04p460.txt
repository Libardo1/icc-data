OPINION OF THE COMMISSION ON GENERAL ISSUES

09Marr9 Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commissions

Tne Citizen Band of Pot;n.tomi Indians, Docket No. 71-A3 and the
Prairie Band of the Potawatoni Tribe of Indians: Docket No. 15-J, filed
seoarate petitions in which they predicated their respecti“e claims upon
the gross inadequacy of the consideration the defendant paid.the Pota'watomi Nation for the cession of S3OOO,OCO acres of lands located in
iowa (Royce 253, Iowa 2) by the treaty of June 5, 1?, iBh6, 9 State 853,

P‘!

and for the 9093565 acres or land located on the Osage River in Kansas
(Royce 2o5, Kansas 2}, included in the above cessiono

The peoitions in the dookcts acove referred to were by the Gene

h E61

In addition to the named bands, each petitioner joined as a party
the Potawatomi Tribe or Nation which is represented by individual members
thereof. However, it is conceded by defendant, or at least not questioned,
that the Citizen and Prairie Bands are the successors in interest of and
constitute the Potawatomi Tribe or Nation and represent all its members.

Another party to the petition in Docket No. ?l—A is the United Nations
of Chippewa, Ottawa and Potawatomi Indians which is represented herein by
individual members thereof. The two bands mentioned above are the successors in interest of the United Nation and represent all its members.

In using the name "Potawatomi" generally herein, we follow the spelling
adopted by the Bureau of American Ethnology and the Indian.Bureau, l Kappler
1021. The use of this adopted spelling seems desirable because of the
many differences in spelling of the name of the Indians involved in this
case. "Where we quote from a document the spelling will be as it appears
in the document itself.

Before going into the merits of these claims, it seems appropriate
to mention the magnitude of the record. There were received in evidence

upwards of hOO exhibits, ranging from a page to as many as 350 pages.

The testimony of witnesses exceeded lhOO pages. Then there were over 200

pages of proposed findings of fact and over 600 pages of briefs. To re»
View this mass of material has been an arduous and time—consuming task.
Some of the more lengthy documents written over a century ago have become

express our appreciation for this help.

,tawa and Chippewa Claims

Dockets 13-J and ho-H were, on.motion of defendant, consolidated for
the purposes of trial with Dockets 15-J and 7l—A. Finding No. 3.

The claims in Dockets 13-J and ho-H are respectively asserted‘hy
individual members of each tribe who allege they are members by blood of
the Chippewa and Ottawa tribes, respectively, and represent all the

descendants of the tribe of which they are members. In each docket there

C.‘

is claimed a third.interest in the 5,000,000 acres of Iowa land, and the

proceeds from the sale thereof, sold by the treaty of June 5, 17, 18b6,
and a like share of the recovery in this case.

As we gather from the petitions, and the findings of fact submitted
jointly by these plaintiffs, they base their respective claims upon the
premise that the Chippewa and Ottawa tribes are the same groups who, with
the Potaeatomi, as the United Eation of Chippewa, Ottawa and Potaeatomi,
were parties to the treaties of September 26, 1833, and June 5, 17, 1856.
But the facts are, and many of the documents relied upon by plaintiffs
in their proposed findings shoe it, that the Chippewa and *ttaea lndians
who, with Potaeatoni, made the treaties of l833 and l8h6, and the treaties
of August 2h, 1816, 7 Stat. lho, August 25, 1828, 7 Stat. 315, and July 29,
l829, 7 Stat, 320, were small groups of Indians with Chi_pewa and Ottawa
ancestry eho affiliated with the predominant group of Fotaeatomio Those

A nrnber of exhibits

plaintiffs have offered no proof to the contrar'o

by the plaintiffs in l3~J and h0—H refer to Cttasa and Chippewa

sessions, in some of which Potawatomi is a party, however, the l

.0

valved are in areas remote from those of the United Nation and in none oi

the exhibits or the treaties does it appear that they were th Chippewa
or Ottawa who were affiliated with the United Nation Potawatomi. The
testimony of Dr. Wallace, Trans. p. lobh, is to this effect. See also
Def. Ex. 51, p. 5h9, in.which the Indian Agent at Council Bluffs, Iowa,
states that although there are at his sub—agency (in the Iowa tract)
Indians of Chippewa and Ottawa ancestry, they describe themselves as
Potawatomi.

A review of the evidence offered by the plaintiffs in Dockets 13-J
and MO-H, and the evidence offered by the defendant and petitioners in
Dockets 15-J and 71-A convinces us that such plaintiffs had no interest
in the Iowa lands and are not entitled to share in the recovery herein.

Therefore, both petitions must be dismissed.

Consideration under the l8h6 treaty.

 

The question of the actual consideration paid the Potawatomi
Nation for the l8h6 cession of the Iowa and Osage river tracts is
important in determining the amount that, under the Indian Claims Com»
mission Act, must be deducted as payment of the claim, and also in
determining whether the consideration was nnconscionable. The pertinent provisions of the treaty are set fbrth in Finding 35.

Article 3 expressiy provides that the cash consideration to be
paid by defendant wa3$8§$OCO "subject to the conditions, deductions
and liabilities provided for in the subsevuent articles of this treaty.”

Passing for the moment Article h and exaainine Articles 5 and 6,

\..)

‘we find that in Article 5, the defendant is required to pay the Indians,

Q"!

out of the agreed consideration, $50,000 to enaeie than to arrange their

h héb

affairs, pay their detts, to purchase transportation facilities, etc.
And in Article 6, defendant was reqnired.to advance out of the agreed
consideration further sums, aggregating $70,000, to cover the expense
of removal and one year's subsistence after their arrival on the Kansas
Reservation.

The petitioners contend that in determining the actual consideration
the total of these advances or deductions, $120,000, should be deducted
from the $850,000, and that the difference, $730,000, constitutes the
consideration for the cession of l8h6. we do not agree. The cash consideration was definitely fixed by Article 3 and payments for arranging
the affairs of the Potawatoni preparatory to their moving, the cost of
moving and subsistence after their arrival on their new reservation
were items to be borne by the Indians but which were to be advanced to
the Indians out of the cash consideration of $850,000, in effect partial

payments.

-&-1‘-I-I’

The defendant, on the other hand, insists that the real consideration

paid for the cession was $1,199,578.01, not includin the value of the

new home in Kansas, later to be discussed. In reaching this corclnsion

the

-In-I-‘I-I

defendant starts with a figure of $2,2§7,Sh8.08 shown at page 3h

F}.

or e-e G.A.0. report (Def. Ex. 56). This is a total of many disburse»

ments made for Potawatomi, including disbursements out of appropriations
made for Wisconsin Indians (Intervenors); $10,963.77 in lieu of tobacco

and steel under Article 10 of the 18h6 treaty which were provided ftr

under an earlier treaty; per capita payments to Potanatomi aggregating

-’o...-u--nu.’-g;

5-’:

some e276,000. These are but part of the items making up the total

h h6§

figure set forth above. In addition, are the disbursements of $120,000

advanced under Articles 5 and 6. Then at page 31 of the report is the
item of interest in the sum of $1,057,970.07, which defendant deducted

from the total disbursements of $2,2S7,5h8.08 to make the sum of

$1,199,578.01 it considers the cash consideration. ‘Whether the interest

item was disbursed under Article 8 of the l8h6 treaty as is indicated
(p. 31, G.A.O. report), or interest on the trust fund provided by
Article 7, which seems more likely, the defendant does not consider

it part of the consideration, and we agree. But deducting the interest

item from the total disbursements does not give a figure representing

the cash consideration for the l8h6 cession since all but a few of the

items have no relation to the consideration for the cession. Some of

the items may constitute offsets, but that is a matter to be deter»

mined only after an award is made and offsets are presented.

By Article h of the l8h6 treaty, the text of which is set forth
in Finding 35, the defendant agreed to grant the Potawatomi Nation
576,000 acres of the lands in Kansas it had acquired from the Kansas

Tribe hy the treaty of January lb, 18b6, 9 Stat. 8&2. It was also

agreed that the defendant deduct therefor from the $850,000 cash payment provided for in Article 3, the sum of $87,000.

The defendant contends that the ceding of the 576 000 acres of
3

land was in reality an exchange of lands the Pctawatomi got for the

lands they ceded and constituted part of the consideration for the

Potawatomi cession. The defendant s position is sunpcrted by the

facts.

During the negotiations for purchase of the Fotawatomi lands

L h

/

\..

in Iowa and on the Osage River, the principal discussions concerned the
cash payment therefor and lands in Kansas the Government was to obtain

for a new home for the Pot natomi. These negotiations began in'Washington3

D. C., on November 7, 18b5, and ended in the'West on June 17, l8h6o (See

t the time of the'Eashington negotiations, which ended.December 2, l8hS,
the Government had not acquired.the Kansas lands which the Potanatomi desired and it was not until after the Government was in a position to give

conceivable that the Potawatomi.nould relinquish their lands without obtaining others in lieu thereof for a new home. t is beyond question

tlat both the Indians and the Government intended by the l8h6 treaty
thatg coupled with and as a part of the transaction, the Indians were to
receive Kansas lands in lieu of those they were ceding.
Moreover, the cash payment provided for in Article 3 was “subject

_nant asserts that for the purposes of this case that

part of the consideration represented by the Kansas grant requires a

determination of the value of the granted lands as of June, 18b6, and the
value thereof as of such date be taken as that part of the total consider»
ation and not the $87,000 the defendant accepted therefor. Further, that
such value should be 50 cents per acre, or $288,000, because in the case
of Kaw Indians V. United States, 1 Ind. Cl. Comm. 608, 613, we valued a
large tract of land, which included the §?6,C00~acre grant, at 50 cents
per acre as of January lh, l8h6, a date only six months before the Potawatomi grant.

It seems more than coincidence that the defendant fixed a value of
the granted lands (15 cents per acre) at about the same price ( lh.38
cents per acre) it paid the Potawatomi for their Iowa and Osage River
lands. The fact that the prices are so near alike suggests a relationship betreen the two transactions as to the agreed value of the lands
involved. Anyway, since we have found in this case that the Government
should have paid about 60 cents per acre more for the Iowa lands and
about 50 cents per acre more for the Osage River lands (Findings 53
and 69) than it did pay in June, 18b6, equity requires that for the
purposes of this case the value placed upon the Kansas grant as of near
the same date, January lh, 18b6, in the
that sum must be taken as the value of those lands as of June, l8h6, and
considered as a part of the consideration for the l8h6 cession.

It is, of course, true that no preol has been offered in this case

as to the value of Kansas granted lands as of Jane, l8h6, aside from our

hardly probable that the Value of these lands changed between January

Kan case, supra, that is, $288,000,

h hééi

and June of 18b6, so in the interests of a prompt determination of this

case we accept the value fixed in the Kan case. The value of 50 cents

per acre does not appear unreasonable. It certainly is not arbitrary.
see Gtoe and Missouria v. United States, 131 0. 0.1.5. 593, 637.
‘we, therefore, reach the conclusion that the consideration for the
l8h6 cession.was cash in the sum of $850,000, plus the value of the
Kansas grant. $288,000, from which is deducted the $87,000 the defendant

received therefor, or the resulting sum of $l.0Sl,000.

Value of Lands involved

 

The petitioners and the defendant are in agreement that the Iowa
tract was acquired by the Potawatomi by the treaties of September 26, 2?,
l833, 7 Stat. h3l and hh2, and that there were 5,000,000 acres of Govern»
ment land.ceded.the Indians by those two treaties. They also agree that
the Osage River tract in Kansas was acquired by the Potawatomi.by the
treaty of February ll, 1837, 7 Stat. 532, and that there were 909.565
acres of Government land ceded the Indians by that treaty, and that the
two tracts were ceded by the Potanatomi Nation by the treaty of June 5, 17,
l8h65 9 Stat. 853.

The most difficult problem in this case is to dete_nine the fair
value of those 5,909,565 acres of land as of June, ldbé an over a hundred

T‘
I-’-.b

and ten.years ago. The petitioners contend for a value of $h.00 acre

or nearly $2h,000,000, while the defendant contends for a value of £5 cents
per acre for the lone land and 35 cents per acre for the Osage river land.

or a total value of $2,So3,3h7. Obviously, even if fruitful, it nonid be
