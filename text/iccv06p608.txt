EEFCRE THE INDIAN CLAIMS COHPIISSION

THE MUG KLESHOOT TRIBE OF INDIANS

on relation of Napoleon Ross,
Chairman of the General Council,

Claimant,

v. Docket No. 98

Defendant.

Decided: July 1?, 1958

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS _c_>_13 FACT

 

The Commission makes the following findings of fact which are
supplemental to the findings numbered l to 25, inclusive, heretofore
made herein:

2C6. The boundaries of the lands which the Commission found the
Muckleshoot Tribe held under original Indian title in 1859, are set
out in Finding 22. The described area contains 101,620 acres ofland.
For convenience these lands will sometimes be referred to as the Huc1d.eshoot tract. The Commis sion found that theuulands were taken by the
defendant as of March 8, 185-9. The question of any rights which the
Fine kleshoot Indians acquired in the tract subsequent to 1859 was left
for a subsequent hearing. No further evidence having been offered on
this question at the hearings completed on September 21;, 1957, on the
issue of value of the Muckleshoot tract, the entire acreage in the

tract, l0l,62O acres, is to be valued as of the date of taking.

27. The Muckleshoot tract is located in the southwestern part of

King County in the present State of Washington. The northwest corner
of the tract is the center of the town of Kent, which is approximately
11; miles southeast of Seattle and slightly over 11 miles east of the
waters of Puget Sound. The northern line of the tract extends west
for about 17'}; miles to Kangley, and from there the boundary runs
slightly to the west of south for about 11;-3: miles to the white River.
The boundary then extends northwest along the White River to Auburn
and from there 5 miles north to Kent.

The White River forms the south boundary of the tract and the Green
River cuts through the center of the land from east to west. The elevation of the Muckleshoot tract varies from 50 to 1807 feet. Most of

the land is level to undulating, with about ll.5i'5 classified as rough,
precipitous land. The Green River flows rapidly through the middle of
the tract falling from an elevation of 858 feet on the east boundary to
an elevation of 90 feet near Auburn, a distance of 16 miles. About hi’?
of the soil is rich and productive, occurring mainly along the narrow
river valleys.
The climate of the area is controlled by the moderating influences

There

of the Pacific Ocean. The winters are mild and -the summers cool.
is an abundance of rain, providing for a damp climate during the entire
year with the exception of a relatively dry period during July and August.
28. The slowness of settlement of the Puget Sound area prior to the
l880‘s can be attributed to its physical inaccessibility and the lack of

transportation facilities. As of 1859 all the communities of western

Washington were virtually dependent upon water transportation. There
were few roads and no railroads in the area. The construction of railroads west of the Mississippi was delayed until sufficient funds were
available, which funds generally were derived from the sale of lands
granted the raiboad. The first transcontinental rail service was to
California in 1859. The Northern Pacific Railroad to the West C_oast
was completed in 1883 and did not reach the Puget Sound area until
1887.
29- BY Act of Congress the Territory of Oregon was established

011 August 11:, 181:8 (9 Stat. 323). This territory included the present
States of Oregon, Washington and Idaho. The Territory of Washington
was created by the Act of Congress of March 2, 1853 (10 Stat. 172) and
included the present States of Washington and idahc. The Act 01‘ March 3,
1863 (12 Stat. 808) created the Territory of Idaho and established the

eastern boundary of the present State 93'; Washington. On November ll,

1889: Washington was admitted to the Union as a state.

white settler in the I-Iucklesheot tract filed his clam in the :£'e£!.l of
1853- Also in that year northern Thurston County became King County

and the plat of the town of Seattle was filed. In 1853 a special cen5'93 listed 170 iniigbitgnts in King County and the census of 1860 showed
°“-13' 302 people in King County. The first settlement within the Muckleshoot tract was established by 1871; at the present site of auburn.

‘auburn (then Slaughter) was laid out in 1886, and other early towns in

the area were Bnumclas in 1885 and Kent in 188? when the railroad was
built through the White River Valley.
Timber

31. The Puget Sound area lies in a band ofheavy timber which

covers virtually the entire area west of the Cascade I-iountains. In

fact, reports indicate that nearly 9/loths of Washington’s timmr is
in that area. The Douglas fir forms about 7/ 8ths of the forest growth.
There is also valuable timber such as red cedar and hemlock. In 1899,
Henry Gannett, Chief of‘ the Division of Geography and Forestry for the
Department of the Interior, reported that “with the exception of the
redeoods of California, the forests of Washington are the densest,
heaviest, and most continuous in the United States. Eccept for a for
airie openings, and except where removed by fire or the arc, they
cover the country as a thick mantle from high up on the Cascade Range
westward to the shore of the Pacific.“ He reported on King County:

This country is in the middle of the State north and
south, arxi extends from the crest of the Cascade Range
westward to the shores of Puget Sound. Much of the easteern part of the county lies high up in the Cascade Range,
and contains little timber of present merchantable value.
Aside hem this and a. few ‘trifling areas of prairie, the
county was originally heavily forested, but the forests
have -been largely removed by fire or the ex. The latter '
has taken the timber from Vashon and Henry islaeis, from
the shca-es of Puget Sound, and oi‘ lakes iiashington and

, Ssmmamish, and from a broad belt along the lm of the
Northern Pacific Railroad, together with other smaller
areas in the interior of the county. Fires have done a
vast amount of damage in various parts of the county,
mainly in its central portion, though the mountainous
regions have not been neglected by it. Irdeed, fully onehalf of the area formerly covered with merchantable timber
has been demtated by fire.

6 611:;

6 612

32. Virtually all reports concerning the early life in the settlement of the Puget Sound area refer to forest fires in the area. While
it is not possible, from the available evidence, to ascertain the dates
or any such fires in the Muckleshoot tract, it appears that fires did
much damage to the forests of the area, even prior to the arrival of
white settlers. There are reportsof the Indians setting great broadcast fires to keep down undergrowth so they could see the game, and to
improve the growth of berry patches. There were reports of great forest
fires tmoughout the Cascades in 1819, of a large fire in the territory
in 1855 and again in 1857. The Muckleshoot area General Land Office surveys, which were made in the 1870's, 1880's and 1890's, contain frequent
references to burned out areas. Township 20 North, Range 6 East, surveyed
in 1872, which is in the southeast corner of the Muckleshoot tract, was

described by the surveyor:

The only important body of good timber is found along the

bank of White River, fires having swept the rest of the tormship of its large trees. T

Of Township 20 North, Range 5 East, which lies along the southwest boundary
of the I-Iuckleshoot land, the surveyor reported in 1872:
A very large portion of the heavy timber, Fir a.u'c1LCed_a‘r, has

been destroyed by fire, probably some 25 or 30 years ago, and

in place thereof a young growth of fir has sprung up very dense
and difficult to get through. Township 21 Korth, Range 6 East, was surveyed from 1871:, to 1882 and is located in the center of the Muckleshoot tract. The surveyor described the

timber in this township as follows:

, ,,..-no o-............-...-......u. 4- c . -a .--qua-pi-0:0-1'-¢-us-m--sou-as-0-H‘--II->-tn. --.’v* --I'''''''‘‘ " "9’ 'This plateau has been covered with a dense growth of
large timber which has been killed by fire, and has since

fallen, covering the ground in many places to the depth of
10 to l5 feet.

A young growth of fir timber now about 20 years old, has
grown up among the fallen trees.

33. The Green River which flows through the center of the Huckleshoot tract was a rapidly flowing stream and not suitable for driving
logs. A portion of the White River was drivable below the mouth of the
Green River. The surveyor of Township 21 North, Range 5 East, reported
in 1867:

The River fmite Rive_r_'7 is navigable for steamers of light
draft below the mouth of Green River. Above that point it
is veryrapid. There has been a quantity of timber taken
out of the river to the Sound for lumber and vast quantities
yet remain.

3b‘.

In the early days of our colonial history, the forests were
nerally regarded as inexhaustible and were in many instances considered
a liability rather than an asset, since many of the early settlers were
interested in the use of the land for agriculture and grazing purposes
and the clearing of lands for those purposes was a burdensome and expensive process. That was the attitude of some of the early OregonWashington settlers where fires were started by them in the forests as
an aid in clearing the land. However, there also existed a recognition
of the need for timber for home and local industries as well as for
shipbuilding and export. From a commercial standpoint the lumber industry in this country had its beginning in Maine, and gradually extended along the Atlantic seaboard and then into the Great Lakes region

in 1850. Lumbering operations of any importance did not reach the

ee13*_

“wagon-Washington area until about 1890 to 1900 although shipments of
-timber began on Puget Sound around 1850. The earliest commercial. uses
made of the vast timber resources were for spars and pilings. The huge
trees were out by the settlers and dragged to the waters’ edge to be
sold and loaded on ships for transportation to the world markets.

35. The first sawmill on Puget Sound was a small waterponer mill
at a Site named New I-iarket, now Tunwater, near the present city of
Olympia, Washington. In September 1852 , there were three sawmills in
operation in what became Washington Territory. ‘Two years later there
were thirty-three sawmills in operation in Washington Territory. In
1855 there were twenty-four sawmills in the Puget Sound area. All the
-saxamills were constructed along the waters of the Sound or on the banks
-of rivers whose waters could be utilized in transporting the logs as
1 8 as providing power for the saws. \The first steam plant sanmill
was Yesler’s mill built in present Seattle in the winter of 1852-3.

It had a capacity of 10,000 to 15,000 board feet per day and became
the main industry in Seattle and for years furnished employment for

the local inhabitants. That mill was about 20 miles from the Huckleshoot tract.
L860 .

The mill in Seattle was the only one in King County in
A mill was started in 1890 at Eddyville about half a mile from
‘he middle of the north boundary of the I-Euckleshoot tract. In 1893
another sawmill was started in the same area at Lake Wilderness. In

.396, the White River mill was constructed three miles east of Ermmclaw,

ust east of the Muckleshoot tract.

6611;,

36.

The early lumbering operations were very crude. The logging

was done by manpower. Trees were fellediby ax, which was used until the

early l880’.s when the cross-cut saw came into use. The trees were cut

into logs of a length which men could handle and were rolled or dragged

to the nearest water to be floated to a sawmill. Because of the laborious
operation, the timber was cut slowly. The timber first cut was that along

the waters of the Sound and those streams which could be used to drive

logs. Even as late as 1880 it was reported that the forests along the

shores of Puget *‘-‘ound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the lower Columbia

River had been culled only of the best trees for a distance of only one

to two miles inland. In the Department of Interior's Census Office Report

on the Forests of North America, by Charles S. Sargent (1881:) it is reported:

The methods adopted by the lumb ermen of western Washington territory are wasteful in the extreme. Loggers out only
timber growing within a mile or a mile and a half of shores
accessible to good booming or shipping points or which will
yield not less than 30,000 feet of lumber to the acre. Only
trees are out which will produce at least three logs 2).: feet
long, with a minimum diameter of 30 inches. Trees are cut
not less than l2 and often 20 feet from the ground, in order
that the labor of cutting through the thick bark and enlarged

base may be avoided, while no or 50 feet of the top of the tree
are entirely wasted.

37. In meping with the early settlers’ attitude toward the liability

of seemingly inexhaustible forests and his desire to clear land, was the

feeling of the lumberman who cared little whether the timber he took legally belonged to him or not. Timber was out indiscriminately from a

neighbor's land, railroad land, or the public domain. It has been rePorted that Puget Sound was the center of wholesale timber stealing. In

6 615

-861 measures were taken to suppress this illegal activity and the areas
leading lumbermen from Port Gamble, Port I-Eadie on, and Seabeck (all
lumbering centers on the shores of the southern part of Puget Sound)
were indicted. The usual penalty upon a finding of guilty was payment
for the land upon which the timber was cut plus a jail sentence of "an
hour of jolly communion“ with the court, the prosecution and the defense.
In an effort to prevent spoliation of public timber a charge of
$2.50 a thousand was made for timber cut on government land. This "stumpage fee“ was opposed by mill men of Puget Sound, who felt the price was
exhorbitant since the land, if surveyed, could be offered for sale at
$1.25 per acre. An agent sent west during the Grant administration

found that since 1855 on Puget Sound alone timber to the value of not

less than $110,000,000 had been stolen from the government. During this
period a common term in the Pacific Northwest was “round forty.” A
settler would acquire ho to 160 acres of land; then he would out not
only the timber on his own land but on the surrounding land on all four
sides. Before he was through cutting, he would have cut from 160 to 610
acres of timber from this government land in addition to his own 140 to

160 acres .

Agriculture

 

38. The Muckleshoot tract contained some fertile land, mostly along

the river valleys. But the productive soil accounted for only about 1%
of the land. Host of the tract was so heavily timb-ered as to prohibit

clearing since the cost was estimated at from $50.00 to $300.00 per acre.

5 616

The 1860 census listed 366,156 acres in the Washington Territory
as farmland. This compared.with 2,060,539 acres of farmland in Oregon
Territory. In 1860 there were only 73 farms containing l2,89h acres in
King County. Less than 1% of the total area of King County‘Was listed
as farmland in the 1860 census. The early history of the entire'Washing- A
ton Territory and in particular the Puget Sound area indicates that the

use of land for agricultural purposes was almost exclusively for the subsistence of the settlers.

39. Under the 0regon.Donation Act of September 27, 1850 (9 Stat.
H96) settlers were able to acquire a right to land in the Oregon Territory,
which included the present State of Washington. The Act originally provided for grants of 320 acres to single, and 6&0 acres to married, white
settlers who had settled on the land claimed prior to December 1, 1850.
The Act required that the settlers live on the land.for four years, cultivate and improve it for their own use and not as agent for anyone else;
that no town lots, mineral lands or lands reserved for public purposes
could be selected. The act limited the donations to one per person.
Actual proof of a settler's compliance with all the terms of the act
was required before a patent could issue, and no patent could issue until
the land.was surveyed.by the government surveyor.

In 1851, 58 entries were made in the Washington Territory under the
Donation Act, and in l8S2 there were ll? entries. The Preemption Act of
September h, ldhl, was made applicable to'WaShington in l8Sh. Under the
Preemption Act, any person who did.nct own land in the Territory or who

was not the proprietor of 320 acres of land in any other State or Territory,

might secure 160 acres of public land at $1.25 per acre provided the
land was surveyed, the Indian title extinguished, actual settlement made
with a dwelling erected, and the settler living on the land. In 1859 the

total acreage taken in the Washington Territory under the Donation and

Preemption Acts totaled ll,277 and this increased in 1860 to 17,971; acres.
The total number of donation certificates and acres of land granted in

Washington and Oregon was:

Oregon -- 7,317 certificates; 2 ,563,757.02 acres

l'3”ashington -- 985 certificates; 290,215.35 acres

The Homestead Act wee enacted May 20, 1862 (12 Stat. 392) permitting
settlers to acquire farms of 160 acres (or 80 acres on land selling for
$2.50 per acre) free except for a nominal filing fee. The Act required
nltivation, improvements and five years’ actual occupancy. However, any
person claiming -under the Act could secure title before the expiration of
the five Years by the payment of the minimum price of the land selected
($1.25 or $2.50 per acre).

Public land could also be acquired by the location of military land
bounty warrants, under the Act of February 11, 181;? (9 Stat. l2 5) , and of
agricultural college scrips, under the Act of July 2, 1862 (12 Stat. 503).

The Timber and Stone Act of 1878 (20 Stat. 89) permitted the sale of
timber lands in quantities not exceeding l60 acres per person and at a
minimum Price Of 32.50 per acre.

The rate at which land in the Muckleshoot tract passed from federal

to private ownerships was as follows:

110. There is no evidence of any sales of land cmparable in size,

character or location to the Muckleshoot tract prior to 1859. There

were, however, several sales which were similar in certain respects to

the land involved in this case. The Pope and Talbot firm, the Puget

Iviill Company, was one of the early purchasers of tracts of timber land.

This company was one of the largest sawmill companies with a mill at
Port Gamble on the western side of the Sound. Under the Act creating

the Washington Territory, two townships of land were allowed for financing
the University. The land could be sold for not less than 81.50 per acre.
POPE? and Talbot were permitted to select the best of this University land
and the records show purchases of 787.75 acres in 18.61; 565.50 acres in
1862; and 17:3-:50 acres in 1863, all at a pmrchase price of $1.50 per
acre. The land so purchased was choice, accessible timberland, not 
than a mile to a mile and a. half from the shoreline of the Sound and with»
in the immediate Vic inity of the Port Gamble mill. Pope and Talbot also
utilized mi_'L'Ltary scrip to acquire 17,398 acres in 1863 but the exact
price paid cannot be determined. The Puget Mill Company purchased

2, 8149.75 acres in Island County for about $1.05 per acre in 1866.

6 619

5 620

The first sale by the Northern Pacific Railroad Company was in
December, 1872, when it sold 2h.69 acres north of Kalama on the Columbia
River at a price of $5.00 per acre. The first sale of more than 200
acres was in May of 1871;. That involved a tract of 590.36 acres on the
Nisqually Plains which sold for $3.15 per acre. From July 1, 1883 _, until
June 30, 1881;, the railroad sold a total of llL7,1:50.l:9 acres in Washington for $11.70 per acre.

The first large purchase of Washington timber land was made on
January 31, 1900, when the famous Weyerhaeuser Timber Company purchased
900 ,O0O acres of the finest Washington timber land from the Northern
Pacific for a price of $6.00 per acre. Of the 900,000 acres so purchased ll6,602.02 were located in King County.

The claimants‘ expert appraiser does not refer to a single land sale
in his report on the value of the Muckleshoot tract.

1:1. The claimant called one witness, James A. Crutchfield, to testify
as an expert appraiser. The only exhibit introduced by the claimant in the
hearing on valuation was Fr. Crutchfield's appraisal report.

Mr. Crutchfield is an economist holding Bachelor's, Master's and
Doctor‘s degrees in economics. He is employed as a Professor of Economics
at 'the.Uni.vers'ity of Washington. He testified that he had worked for 18
months on a regular basis and at intervals with Larry Smith & Co., real
estate consultants. He was also employed from 19113 to 19145 as a district
economist for the Office of Price Administration and was employed from
1951 130 1952 as regional economist for the Office of Price Stabilization.

MI‘. Crutchfield testified that his work for Larry Smith 8.; Co. involved

some valuation of specific properties and valuation of alternative uses

of property to see in which the income would be higher. ‘On cross examination Mr. Crutchfield testified that Larry Smith 8; Co. had never appraised
tracts of land in the thousands of acres and he stated that he did not hold
himself out as an expert appraiser; of lands on a contract basis.

Mr. Crutchfie ld evaluated the Muc kle shoot land by two alternative

methods .

(8) The first method used to determine value was on the basis of

the actual commercial use which land might have. Mr. Crutchfield determined that the primary commercial use for the Muckleshoot area would be

from the prospective yield of the merchantable timber. He then “assumed"

that the timber in the I~=1r’uckleshoot area would have averaged 114,300 feet

E4 per acre in 1859. He then took a valuation figure of $114.30 per‘ acre

as of l902 and discounting that figure at 8% corwuted a value oi‘ $2.09
per acre as of l8S9. I-Er. Crutchfield further found that a small portion
of the Muckleshoot land would be usable for agriculture, and for such

“Sage he added 15 cents per acre for the entire tract‘. This results in

311 average Of $2.21.; per acre valuation. . No value was assigned for mineral resources.

(1?) The second method of evaluation used by Mr. Crutchfield was
the “subsistence valuation." Mr. Crutchfield, in his report, states

that Indians in Washington were employed at money wages of $0.50 to

$1‘-25 3 €13?» Taking an average rate of $1.00 a day, Mr. Crutchfield

considered that an Indian in 1859 could have earned from $150 to $300

P93‘ Year. Taking the lower ($150) figure and multiplying it times 130

(‘the reported total population of the Muckleshoot tribe in 1859), HI‘Crutchfield arrived at a figure which he claims the Muckleshoot Indians
could have made had they worked for the white man rather than in making
their own subsistence from the land. Since it appears the I-Iuckleshoot
Indians preferred their own way of life to employment at this annual
income, Mr. Crutchfield submits that the land must have been worth at
least that annual income figure. At a capitalization rate of 6% he
computed the value of the Muckleshoot land to be $325, 000 from which
sum he deducted 10% or $32,500, representing the value of the fishing
rights retained by the Indians. This leaves the sum of $292,500, or
about $2.88 per acre, which he considers was the value of the Muckleshoot lands as of 1859 under Indian usage.

Mr. Crutchfield then multiplied the figures arrived at by both
valuation methods by 2.7, which is ,‘ he maintains, the value by which
the dollar has depreciated since 1859 on the basis of the index of
wholesale prices of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

112. The defendant submitted voluminous documentary evidence bearing on the valuation of the Muckleshoot land , including an exhaustive

3-Ppraisal report by Mr. Vern A. Englehorn, who also testified for the defendant as an expert appraiser. Mr. Englehorn is a partner in the ownership 035' Western Farm Management Company, which he reports is the largest

farm and ranch management and appraisal service in the western half of

the United States. He has had extensive and varied experience in land

3PPTaisal. Hr. Englehorn appraised the land on the basis of its rm

6 622

market Value in 1859 taking into consideration that its highest and best
use was timber production and considering its size, accessibility, surrounding sales, and other factors which would be involved in its utilization or resale. Mr. Englehorn, based on all the facts outlined in his
report, was of the opinion that the Muckleshoot area had only a nominal
fair market value not exceeding $10,000, or a little over 9 cents an
acre, as of _March 8, 1859.

h3.

Commission finds that the Muckleshoot tract, consisting of 101,620 acres,

Upon the basis of the record and the facts as found above, the

had a fair market value as of March 8, 1859, of $0.85 per acre or

$86,377.00.
