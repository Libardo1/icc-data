OPIIIION

Witt. Chief Commissioner. delivered the opinion of the Commission:

Three separate cases were filed, Dockets Hos. 33, 34. and 35. In
all the cases the parties are the same, .the allegations respecting the
capacity in which Felix McCaule:7 acts are identical. The defendant

filed separate answers. The plaintiff seeks to recover the value of

distinct tracts of land.
On September 19, 195:9 the Commission made an order consolidating

the tmee dockets named for the purposes of trial and the trial proceeded as though the cases had been included in a single petition.

.At the‘close of the evidence the defendant raised the question
as to the sufficiency of the plaintiff‘s evidence in each claim by
the following demurrer:

Comes now the Defendant and demure to the
evidence of the Plaintiff for the reason that the
same is insufficient to establish the claim in.fa‘vor of Plaintiff and against the Defendant. And
Defendant demure specifically to the evidence on
the ground that the evidence fails to establish
that the individual plaintiffs fairly represent
the claims of persons which they purport to represent.

By per curiam opinion of September 26. 1950 the demurrer of the
defendant to plaintiff's evidence was overruled; and thereafter the
three dockets were submitted together on their merits.

Docket No. 34 is for additional compensation to whioh.plaintiff
claims it is entitled for the cession of-lands by treaty of June 3.
1825 which.plaintiff alleges aggregated 23.962?240 acres. Plaintiff
contends that said lands at the time of said cession were of the‘
reasonable value of $1.25 per acre, aggregating the total sum of
$29.952.8oo; that the consideration received by plaintiff therefor
did not exceed the sum of $75,000; that plaintiff is therefore justly

entitled to recover the difference between the alleged value of said

lands and the consideration received therefor. By requested findings‘

of fact. plaintiff reduces the claim to 18,314,240 acres and acknowledges a consideration therefor of $80,000, and the fair and reasonp
able value of the land at the time of cession to be not less than

$18.31u.24o.oo.

Docket R0. 35 is for additional compensation plaintiff claims
for the 2,000,000 acres off the east end of the reservation, ceded
to the defendant by Article 1 of the treaty of January 10, 1806,
Plaintiff contends that the $202,000 consideration.paid by the
defendant to it for said 2,000,000 acres of land-wan $2,298,000
less than its value at the time of the cession, and it sues for

the additional sum of $2,298,000.

\

.Docket E0. 33 is a suit for the value of 9,000,000 acres of
land which plaintiff alleges was the remainder of its reservation
after the deduction of the 2,000,000.acres off the east end ceded
by'Artic1e l of the treaty of 1806. rPlaintiff alleges that said
9,000,000 acres of land were worth $10,930,180 in excess of the.
value of the Council Grove Eeservation.provided it in lieu of the
9,000,000 acres acquired.by the defendant. The claim is, however,
reduced by the requested findings of fact to the value of not less
than 0,559,000 acres, plaintiff contending that the value of
4:559,000 acres at the time of taking was $5,708,700 and that the
value of the Council Grove Eeservation.pr0vided for plaintiff in

lieu of said larger tract so taken was $319,568. thereby making
plaintiff‘s claim for additional compensation the difference in

said amounts, to wit, $5,029,172.

-11.Docket No. :31;

This claim is based on the contention that the plaintiff had
aboriginal title to the entire acreage described in the treaty.
amounting to 18,314,240 acres of land exclusive of the reservation
provided by said treaty; and that. if it should be mistaken in
thinking aboriginal title had been proven, the ownership of said
lands was recognized and acknowledged by the defendant at the time

of said cession. and that plaintiff was not. therefore. required

to prove its aboriginal ownership in order to be entitled to compensation therefor.

There is practically no evidence of the occupancy and exclusive
possession byithe Kaws of the ceded area. The first contact of this
tribe by the white man seems to have been when they were found by
Juan deonate in 1601. .-At that time they were living some 100 leagues
northeast of San Gabriel, New Mexico, near the Panana or Kawnees.

On Marquette‘s map, drawn about 16714-, the Kansas (Kaws) were shown
some distance west of the Osages and south of the Omahas. In 1721+
Bourgmont found a large village of the Kansas. or Quans. as he called
them, atthe mouth of Independence Creek. near the Missouri River.
near the present town of Doniphan. Doniphan County. Kansas. This
village was about 30 leagues above the mouth of the Kansas ‘River.

The Missouria Tribe of Indians then had a village about 30 leagues

below the mouth of the Kansas River. In 1723 the French established

-5Fort Orleans on an island at Malta Bend in the Missouri River for
the purpose of promoting and controlling trade relations which had

been previously established with the Kansas, Otoes, Iowas. Osages,

Missourias. and Pa:-rnees. According to Lewis and Clark, the Kansas

or Kaw Indians in 1801-Iv resided in two villages on the Kansas Ever.

one about 20 leagues and the other about 1&0 leagues from its mouth.

A treaty of peace between this tribe and the United. States was made

on October 28, 181.5 at St. Louis, at which time they were living on

the Kansas River at the mouth of the Saline River. Pike's charts

First Part‘, of the internal part of Louisiana. shows the Kansas
villages on the south side of the Missouri River, above the mouth

of the Kansas River. In Clark‘s map of 1810, one of these. villages

is located near the mouth of the Independence River and another

Kansas village at a point some distance up the Kansas Fiver.

William E. Connslley. Secretary of the Kansas Kistorical
Society, in Volume XVII, says that the occupancy of Kansas by the
Kansa Indians  but a village here and a village there and a vast
hunting ground which was common to a number of tribes--that until about
1700 they had lived on the east bank of the Missouri and on the islands
in that river-—-that they never did occupy any considerable part of the State of Kansas.
The Kansas or Kaw tribe was never a large one. Lewis‘ and Clark

in 1801} reported its numbers to be-1300; Long in 1819 reports 1500;
Sibley in 1820, 800; Chouteau, in 1830, 1300-1500. In 18"-I-1+ the Conmissioner of Indian .1L‘i'fairs reports the number of the tribe to be

Commissioner of Indian.Affairs reports the Haw population to be
Ehha

Ehat the defendant recognized other claimants to portions
of the lands ceded by the Kaws in 1825 is evidenced by the various
cessions made by other tribes, as set out in finding of fact Ho. 20

The judicial question here presented is as to the sufficiency
of the evidence to establish the_original Indian title of the
plaintiff tribe to the territory claimed.

In.the case of Pawnee Indian Tribe v. United States, Docket
No. 10. decided by this Commission July 14. 1950, an extensive
review of the authorities governing the proof required to establish
original Indian title was made. and based'upon those authorities we

concluded that the question is one of fact. to be determined as any

question of fact; and we held that to constitute aboriginal posses-‘

sion.it must be established as a fact that there was actual and exclusive occupancy of definable territory by the tribe asserting the
title. As stated later by this Commission in the case of the Qnapaw

Tribe V3 United States, Docket No. ls, decided by this Commission

on March 11+, 19513

It is perhaps not required that the boundary lines
be as accurately defined as a surveyor would like them but
some general boundary lines of the occupied territory must
be shown. and it must be shown that the occupant had the
possession to the exclusion of other tribes; constructive
possession is not sufficient. Authorities cited.

-it

i Ind.

Cl. Comm. 503 523

-7The most that can be said for the proof submitted is that the

Kass at the time of the 1825 treaty. occupied two villages on the

Kansas River and.that no contacts by the whites prior thereto for
many years had found them elsewhere than along the Kansas River.
although they might at times have roamed some territory north and
west of same for hunting purposes, which territory, however. was
hunted over at the same time by other tribese

After studying the entire record we can reach no other conclusion than that the evidence is insufficient to establish.abo—

riginal possession to the lands for which compensation is asked in

Docket No. 34; and therefore that plaintiff has not shown it had

Indian title thereto.

We then come to the question of whether or not the ownership
of this territory was recognized and acknowleded by the defendant

in the negotiations for and acceptance of the cession of 1825.

If plaintiff is correct in.this contention, proof of its orig—.

inal title is unnecessary. The treaty involved (June 3. 1825) uses

this language of cession. to wit:

The Kansas do hereby cede to the United States all
the lands lying within the State of Missouri, to which.
the said nation.have title gg_claim; and do further cede and relinquish. to the said United States. all other lands

which they new occupy, or to which they have title gg_claim.
lying West of the said State of Missouri s s s. (Underscoring supplied).

 

then.follows a description.of the area described in the petition;

:following this language is a description of the lands reserved for

'1

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 608 524

- 8 the use of the Indians (the cession of which to the defendant by

a later treaty is made the basis of the claims urged under the

other docket numbers). A.full discussion is made by this Commission.of the question of recognition of title by the defendant in

the negotiations and acceptance of cessione from Indians in the»
decision of the Qpapaw case. Docket He. l#, to which previous reference herein is made. In.keeping with the viewpoint of this Commission as expressed in that opinion. the entire record in the instant
case on.said issue has been carefully considered, and it is the opinp
ion of this Commission that there was no recognition by the Government
of the ownership by the Kaws of the vast acreage described in the
cession treaty.

To support its contention as to recognition, plaintiff cites
letters of William Clark to the Secretary of War. dated June 25. 1820
and December 8. 1823. It is submitted that these letters do not de;
scribe with any definiteness lands as being owned by the Kaws or those
owned by the Osages, the claims of both tribes being involved in the
letters. The letters. at most. merely indicate that the writer thought
that the Osage and Kansas Indians were hunting over more territory
than they needed to have. and that their g;aig_to such extensive tera
ritory should be extinguished—~not that their acknowledged.title to

such territory shculd be extinguished. Moreover. said letters do

i not indicate what portion of the territory to which reference is made

l Ind. C1. Comm. 608 ' 525

..9..

belonged to the Osages or what portion belonged to the Haws. As was
the habit with most Indian tribes, during a long period.of years they
roamed and hunted over very much larger tracts than they had the ex»
clusive occupancy and possession of. Regardless of what might have
been the opinion of William Clark, or what he might have said. he
could not bind the government.

Plaintiff cites language appearing in Court of Claims opinion‘
(80 C. Cls. 264) and in the opinion of the Indian Claims Commission.
in the Pawnee case (Docket E0. 10) as confirming the contention.o£
plaintiff that there was a recognition of plaintiff‘s ownership of
the entire acreage described in the cession of 1825: This Commission
cannot agree with such contention.

The plaintiff. in the opinion of this Commission, has established
neither a recognized title to the lands ceded by the treaty of 1825
nor the aboriginal ownership of the same, therefore the claim as made

in Docket No. 3@.mnst be dismissed.

Docket Ho, §§

By Article 1 of the treaty of January 14, l846 the said Kansas or
Kaw Tribe of Indians made a definite cession of 2,000,000 acres off the
east end of the reservation described in Article 2 of the 1825 treaty
for the consideration of $202,000. The remainder of said reservation

was conditionally ceded.by-Article 5 of said treaty, but Docket E0. 35

1 Ind. C1. Comm. 608 J , 526

-10..

tdeals solely with the cession of the 2.000.000 acres, it being
alleged that the land had a value of $2,298,000 in excess of the
amount received therefor. By p1aintiff‘s requested finding of
fact No. 11, plaintiff concedes that the consideration received

for the cession of said 2.000.000 acres of land as of the date

of the cession was $202.000, or l0.lé per acre. By requested
finding of fact He. 15. plaintiff asserts the value of the 2,000,000
acres as being not less than $1.25 per acre and contends that the
consideration received for said land was unconscionable.

As to whether or not the consideration was unconscionable is
dependent upon the value of the lands at the time of the cession.

This Commission has very recently. in Docket no. 10. (Qnapaw)
discussed at considerable length the difficult problem of determining
the value of Indian lands at the early dates involved in many of these
cessions. As stated in that case, the Federal Courts have consistently
followed the concept of the “market value" as a,practical standard to
be applied in the ordinary case. (Cases cited).

‘Quoting from the Quapaw opinion again:

_, * * * the value of property at a given time

depends upon the relative intensity of the social

desire for it at that time, expressed in the money

it would bring in the market.

Another difficulty in this case, as in the Quapaw case, is the

fact that a large tract of land is involved as of a time -4 over 100

years ago n- when the lands were occupied largely by Indians making

J. Ind. C1. Comm. 608 ‘ 627

-11limited use of them, and prior to which time there had been no

sales in the coded area by which value may be gauged. In a recent
opinion of the Court of Claims (Appeals Docket Eo. h - the Osage
case) that Court. with reference to the fixing of the value of Indian
lands. says:

In arriving at a fair determination of the market

value of tribal lands. this Court has often taken intop

consideration the prices at which the lands sold, the

extent of the land, the quality of the land. and its use

at the time. It has also considered the price paid by

the Government for similar land at about the same time

under treaties with.other bands of Indians. and the

‘prices paid by persons other than Indians buying similar

lands in the locality from private citizenso

iwhile the evidence as to value introduced in this case is not
voluminous, yet it is thought that same will furnish a reasonable
basis for the opinion at which we arrive. as such evidence encom*passes transactions of the various kinds to which the Courts have
heretofore given consideration in similar situations.

The valuation. of course. is of the date of the cession. to Wits
January lb, l8@6. As early as 1820, by.Act of Congress, the price of
public lands was fixed at $1.25 per acre. Of course, this.Act was
dealing with sales of small tractso The Preemption Law; which also

‘provided.for sales at a minimum.price of $1.25 per acre, was passed

in 18309 which dealt with tracts not exceeding 160 acres. Later, in

18549 what was called the Graduation Act was passed. This set provided

for a minimum price of $1.25 per acre for public lan . which.price was

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 608   628 ;

-12reduced after lands went unsold for a period of years. Then. in
1862. the Homestead Act was passed. which provided. for the donation

of homesteads to actual settlers. Some sales of the Kaw Reservation

‘lands are mentioned in the finding of the Court of Claims in the Kaw

case (80 Ct. Cls. 240). Up to September. 1837. 13,629.19 acres, being
36 sections on the Big Blue. were reported as having been soldiat an
average of $1.223 per acre. (Finding No. III.) A total of $7,906.76
acres of these lands was sold up to May 8. 1872 for a total of
$53,982.23. of which sum $53.91+1+.58 was in scrip $37.65 in cash.
(Finding No. XVII.) The value of this scrip at this time, however. is
not shown. The sale oi‘ the 255,000-plus acres of the Council Grove '
Beserwfation is found to have been the sum of $1-I-01+, 010.23. (Finding
Ho.-XVII.) These sales covered the years from 1864 to 191s.

On June 17. 1846 the United States sold to the Pottawatomie Indians 576,000 acres off the East end of the Kat-I Reservation at a price
of 15 cents per acre. At the same time the United States acquired
from the Pottawatornies 5,000,000 acres ‘in Iowa and 870,000 acres in
Southeast Kansas for a total consideration of $850,000. 0

Up to 1853 that portion of what was known as the Plains country.
and which later became the States of Kansas and Nebraska. was considered
Indian country and none but Indians had permission to live there. How-s
ever. by that time there was considerable demand to open that section
for white settlement and a few settlers had crossed the Missouri River

and gone into the territory with the intention of locating there.

1. Ind. c1. Comm. 608 629

In 1854 nnmerons treaties were entered into with various tribes
of Indians by which approximately 18.000.000 acres of lands in.Eastern

Kansas and Nebraska (most of which had been.previously ceded by the
"United States to the Indians out of lands acquired from the Kaws'and
Osages) were reacquired by the United States. The territories of
Kansas and Nebraska were set up in 1854 and the first land offices

in Kansas and Nebraska were opened but no land was sold until 1857.
There were no roads at the time except the Santa Fe Trail. the Mormon
Trail. and the Oregon Trail. which were transcontinental routes to the
West coast. Early settlement followed chiefly the river valleys.
Neither in.Kansas nor Nebraska did settlement extend very far West
‘until some years following the opening up of this territory. The
sales to settlers up to 1859 in Hebraska totaled 125.358 acres. and
in.Kansas 139.866 acres.

On May 10. 1854. the Shawnees ceded 1.000.000 acres of land
adjoining on the South and East the land ceded by the Kaw Indians
by the treaty of 1886. and for which the United States agreed to pay
$829.000. or about 59 cents per acre.

By treaty of May 18. 1854. the Sank and.Foxes ceded 96.000

acres previously assigned to them out of lands ceded by the Haws in

1825. for which the United States paid them $48,000. or 50 cents per

8.038 a.

By treaty of May 18. 1854. the Kickapoos ceded 618,000 acres to

the7United States which was a part of the lands which had been assigned

1 Ind. Cl. Comm. 608 I 0 - 530

-11.}...

"to them out of lands ceded to the United States ‘by the Kansas Indians in 1825. For this cession the United States agreed to pay
$300,000. approximately 50 cents per acre. 0

By treaty of June 5. 1851+. the Miami Indians ceded lands
assigned to them out of the Kaw cession “estimated to contain
500,000 acres“ for $200,000. There has been some controversy as
to the acreage of this cession. and the price. by reason of such
divergence of opinion as to acreage. was somewhere between 1+6 and
71 cents per acre. I

It is in evidence that a large tract (exact acreage not mentioned) of College Grant ieha in Eemaha and Marshall Counties,
Kansas. in 1864- was sold for an average price of 1+2 cents per acre.
In 1878. to the North of the Eat: country in Hebraslm. 20,000 acres
ofrailroad land sold for an average price of 50 cents per acre.
Other railroad land sold in 1879 for $1.67 per acre.

Dr. John lafuehlheier. as an expert for the defendant. testified
that thelands involved had no actual market value in tracts of the
size involved at the time of the cessions; that his opinion as to
value was the result of taking into consideration (1) the use value

of the land to the Indians. (2) the cost of acquisition and the

receipts from the disposal of public lands. and (3) en imputed market '

value of the lands based on a value at the time of acquisition that
would be justified by the sale price in later years, taking into

consideration the matter of interest and taxes over the years. From

J. Ind. C1. Comm. 608 531
- 15 —

these various approaches to the problem he fixes a value of from
2 to 18 cents on the reservation lands involved at the time of the
cessions. Dr. Mnehlbeier admitted that he knew of no Court whichp
had used his methods in determining values. 2

Taking into consideration the evidence in the record. Judicial
notice of similar cessions and conditions surrounding the same. and
the values found and sustained by the Courts. we reach the conclusion
that the 2,000,000 acres involved in Docket No. 35 had a market value
at the time of the cession of 50 cents-per acre, or a total of I
$1,000,000.

we have applied the principles and reasoning as to the deterC mination of whether or not a consideration is unconscionable. as

recently held by this Commission in Cause No. 14 (Qnapaw claim). and

that appearing in the decision of the Court of Claims in its Appeals

p Docket no. 4 (Osage case). and decide that the consideration ($202,000)

received for this 290009000 acres of land was unconscionable and that
plaintiff is entitled to an award in the sum of $1,000,000, less the
$202,000 paid under the provisions of the cession. and less such
effects, if any. as may hereafter be allowed in accordance with

Section.l2 of the General Rules of Procedure of this Commission.

Docket No, 3:}

By Article 5 of the treaty of Jamiary 11+. 1836 it was provided

0 that after the Western line of the 2.000.000 acres cession. provided
by Article 1 of the treaty, had been determined the President of the
United States was authorized. if there was not a sufficiency of timber
on the remaining land of the reservation, to cause to be selected and
laid off for the tribe. another body of land which should remain for
the tribe's use forever. in consideration of which the remainder of
the reservation not ceded in the first article of the treaty should
be ceded to the United States.

It is alleged by the plaintiff herein that said provision of said
treaty was made the basis of the selection of another tract of land.
to-wit: 255,854.39 acres near the Eastern boundary of said reservation
incouncil Grove and the said tribe was made to accept said Council
Grove Reservation, on which they were relocated. and the remainder of
the reservation. as described in the treaty of 1825. became the property of the United States. The remainder of said reservation was
originally alleged to be "about 8. 71!-1I~,l1+6 acres of land”;‘ however, by
plaintiff‘s requested finding of fact Ho. 16 the remainder of their
reservation so acquired by the United States under and by virtue of
Article 5 of said 1846 treaty is claimed as being "not less than
1+.559.01Jr0 acres.“ Plaintiff's cause of action thereby. under Docket

No. 33. becomes the alleged difference in value of the 1+,559,0?+O acres

l Ind. Cl. Comm. 608 ' i633

-17acquired by the defendant and the Council Grove Reservation of
255.85#.&9 acres provided the plaintiff by the defendant in lieu
thereof. By its requested.finding of fact no. 20 plaintiff claims
that the 4,559,040 acres acquired by the defendant had a value of

$5,429,172 in excess of the value of the Council Grove Reservation

received by it.

Our first problem is to determine the amount of land acquired

by the Government by the above exchange. It is admitted by both ‘

‘parties that the evidence wholly fails to show that the lands reserved a

to the Indians under the treaty of 1825 were surveyed at any time. The
difficulty in determining the acreage is due to the difficulty in locating the Western boundary of the tract ceded by the Indians. The

reservation as provided by Article 2 of the treaty provides that same

Shall begin 20 leagues up the Kansas River and shall be a tract 30
miles in width. extending hest through the land ceded in the first
article. The size of the reservation. therefore. depends upon the
distance the strip extends to the West. and that distance depends on
the location of the western boundary of the cession described in
.Article 1. .Article 1 provides that the cession shall extend to the
West "to the source of the Kansas River. leaving the old village of
the Pania.Bepublic to the West; from thence. on the ridge dividing
the waters of the Kansas River from those of the Arkansas, to the
Western boundary of the State line of Missouri.“ The defendant would

place this Western.boundary line to the East of an old Pawnee village

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 608 h ’ 534

...]_8...

located near the 971:1: meridian (andrnot going to the source ofthe
Kansas River) from whence. in order to reach the dividing waters of
the ‘Kansas River from those of the Arkansas. the Western line would

‘be compelled to take an almost direct Southerly direction crossing

the Kansas River and to the ridge dividing its waters from those of
the Arkansas, and then almost due East following the said. ridge to
the’ boundary of the State line of Missouri. The source of the Kansas
River (or the source of a stream. to wit. either the Republican or
Smoky Hill. both of which flowed into what ‘became the Kansas River)
1.-zasufar West of even the 100th meridian; its source was near the ridge
dividing the waters of the Kansas Kiver from those of the Arkansas;
and by construing the language of the treaty as requiring the Northern
boundary to reach this river's source it would make it unnecessary to
proceed far in a Southerly direction to reach the ridge dividing the
waters of the Kansas and Arkansas Rivers before returning in a meandering
Easterly direction to the Western boundary of the State of Missouri.

It would seem that if the parties to the treaty had desired to fix,
the Western limit of the ceded land at or near an old village of Pania
then the treaty would have so stipulated. and would not have named the
source of the Kansas River. and there would have been no need for
naming theKan.sas River unless it was to provide that the Western ‘boundary should, froman old Fania village, proceed in a Southerly direction,
across the Kansas River. to the ridge dividing its waters and those of

the Arkangas 0

Few map makers of the time or others fixing this Western line
and the acreage ceded by the treaty of 1825 have placed the line
further East than the 100th meridian. The Paul Brody map (plaintiff's
Exhibit Ho. 4) does not show the “old village of the Pania Republic.“
but it does show the Western limit of the 1825 cession as the source
of the Kansas River and located that source in what is now the State
of Colorado. This map was made long before the claims here involved
were under consideration.

Defendant's Exhibit No. 1&7 (referred to as the Wedel map) shows
three Pawnee villages, but in testifying as to this map Dr. Wedel ears
(defendant's Exhibit no. 55. Page 26) that he had been unable to determine to his own satisfaction which site was being referred to in the
treaty of 1825. It will be noticed that there are two Pawnee villages
located on tms map near the 98th meridian and both are to the East of
the Northern boundary line of the cession, as is the Pawnee “village
located near the 96th meridian.

with respect to the source of the ‘Kansas River. the Clark map
(plaintiffs mhibit No. 3) shows that the stream now called the Smoky
Hill River was designated by him as the Kansas River, and that the
Solomon and Republican streams were called by him "forks of the 
River.” In Pike's map (plaintiff’s Exhibit No. 2) all three streams
are called forks of the Kansas River; and Pike states that the river
Kansas takes its source in the plains shown on the map to be at the

headwaters of the Republican for}: and Smoky Hill for.‘::: of the Kansas River.

The report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs dated Novem‘oer 30, 1825 (plaintiff's Exhibit No. 12L») says the reservation to
the Kat-rs (and Osages) in the 1825 treaty extended to the Spanish
line. In 1825 this Spanish line to the west of the Kaw Reservation
wee approximately 106° west longitude. The treaty of the Oeages of
June 2, 1825 provides for the western boundary of the Osage cession
in about the same language as in the Kaw cession. William Clark,
in reporting the treaty of the Osag-es and Kaws. indicates their"
western boundary to be approximately the same. Subsequent dealings
with the Osages (sessions of September 29, 1865 and act of Congress
of July 15, 1870-Plats 1-I-75, ‘+76 and 530 on the Royce Kansas Map)
Show recognition of the western boundary of the Osages cession to
be approximately 100° west longitude. In the case of the K81-IS v.
United States, 80 0. Ole. 264, the Court of Claims makes a finding
of the ceesion of l825 as being approximately 26,000,000 acres ,, with

a reservation to the Indians of approximately 6,000,000 acres.

A commission was created under agreement of the parties to
settle the claims of the Kansas or Kaw Indians against the United
States, which commission made a report dated January 1%, 1905 (claimant's

Exhibit Ho. l52)a. In reference to the size of the Kaw Reservation this

commission says:

1 Inc‘. Cl. Comm. 608% ' 637

-21Under the provisions of the treaty. the eastern
boundary of the reservation was established in 1826
and the southern.bonndary surveyed.and.marked for a
distance of 200 miles. In 1836 the north boundary
was surveyed and marked. beginning at the northeast
corner of the reservation as established by the former
survey. and extending west to a distance of 206 miles.
The reservation farther west was not surveyed. but the
entire reservation contained an estimated area of
6.163.200 acres. (Plaintiff‘s Exhibit E0. 152. page 9.)

At page 36 of this exhibit the Kaw Commission report refers to
the Kass having possessed originally "a large and valuable property
which.(1f the Government had properly handled) would have left them
one of the richest tribes."

The Gonmission is of the opinion that the preponderance of

_ evidence shows that the so-called surplus lands in plaintiff's

reservation (after deducting the 2,000,000 acres) was 0.559.000

acres.

The evidence of value herein detailed in Docket Ho.-35 applies
equally to the lands involved in this Docket number. and there is
nothing in.the record to show that the land constituting the Council
Grove Reservation was greatly. if any. different from the land comprising
the 2.000.000 acres cession off the East end of the Kaw Reservation. The

plaintiff alleges the same per acre value for the 2,000,000 acres cession

and the Council Grove tract. There is nothing in the record upon which _'

a different value per acre can.be placed upon the Council Grove acreage
from that placed on the other lands. This 255;85¢;49 acres is therefore

found to have a value of 50 cents per acre, or a total of $127.927.25.

The Commission is of opinion that the h.559.0#d acre portion
of the reservation being further removed from the settled country
to the East than.uas the 2.000.000 acres and Council Grove tracts.
and from transportation and other developments and conditions contributing to market value. had a value at the time it was acquired
by the United States of #0 cents per acre, or a total of $l.823.6l6.

The compensation received by the plaintiff. being the value of
the Council Grove tract of $127,927.25. fer a tract of the value of
$1,823,616. was unconscionable. and plaintiff is therefore entitled
to an award on this claim in the sum of $1,823,616 less the value

of the Council Grove Reservation. to wit. $l27.927.25. and less

‘such offsets. if any. as may hereafter be allowed in accordance

with Section 12 of the General Rules of Procedure of this Commission.

gglease of Claims
The defendant alleges that the Kaw Tribe of Indians executed a

release, dated April 22. 1905. for a good. valuable and sufficient
consideration of all claims whatsoever the said tribe then had against

defendant. and by virtue thereof plaintiff's right of action against

defendant. if any they had. and defendant's liability for said claims.

if any existed. were extinguished; and said release is pleaded as a
settlement and extinguishment of the claims urged by plaintiff in.
Dockets Nos. 33. 3h. and 35.

Plaintiff denies that said release had the effect of releasing

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 608 ' T ‘ 639
- 23 - °

the claims mentioned for the following reasons. to wit:

1. The aforesaid claims had never been submitted to the
Km: Commission. whose award upon other claims was being paid and
which claims only did the defendant have a right to require be
released.

2. The Kaw Commission had no authority under the Act of
Congress creating it to consider the aforesaid claims.

A commission. thereafter known as the Eat: Commission. to

“ consider and determine claims-of the Kaw Tribe of Indians against

the United States was created by virtue of an act of Congress of

July 1. 1902. Section 12 of said act provided for the submission

- to a commission. to be appointed by the Secretary of the Interior.

of all claims of whatever nature which the Eat: Tribe had or claimed

to have against the United States "for investigation. consideration.
and settlement." Said section further provided. that the’ United W
States should submit a complete accounting of all monies agreed to

be paid to said tribe to which said tribe may be entitled “under any
treaty or act of Congress N; and the section further provided that if
the tribe should not be satisfied with any settlement decreed by said
Commission. it should have the right to enter a suit in the Court of
Claims for the amount due, or claimed to be due, it from the United
States "under any treaties or laws of Congress." Said section further
provided that said court. if appealed to. “shall settle all the rights.

both legal and equitable. of both the said Kansas or Kaw Tribe of

1 Ind. c1. Comm. oosi ‘   640
' - 21+ .. '

Indians and of the United States.i-" Pursuant to said act of Congress,‘
a commission was duly appointed and the Kaw Indians were notified to
submit their claims to said commission. Thereafter the tribe made
presentation of claims before said commission but "did not specifically apply for any moneys other than those growing out of the various
certificates of indebtedness or scrip transactions, although in a
general way claim was made for all other moneys justly due the tribe
in the adjustment of the accounts between it and the United States.“
(Kaw Indians 7. United States. 80 C. Gls. 319). The court. in the
above case. continues with the statement: .

me commission made a comprehensive report in

issuance and redemption of the various classes of

scrip. including interest thereon. was reviewed. and

made an award to the plaintiff tribe of a specific

amount found to be due on account of such transactions.

The report of the said commission (plaintiff's Exhibit No. 152_.
page 37), in reference to the claim of the Indians for compensation
for surplus and other lands, states that the Ear: Indians had entered
into a contract with one Henry G. Dooley “stipulating for his employment to prosecute an alleged claim of said Indians against the United
States for payment for surplus lands obtained by the United States
under the treaties of 1825 and 1846, " and that “This contract. with
accompanying papers, was submitted to the Department by the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs. December 20. l898, and was approved in modified form

February 7. 1899.‘? That “In View of this approval Mr. Dooley was noti1 Ind. C1. Comm. 608 _' 541

fied of the organization.of the commission and informed that he

would be afforded an.opportunity to be heard in.behalf of the

~Indians." that "He appeared before the commission soon after its

organization and stated that he would be ready within a few days
to present his claim." That “He further appearance was made by
Mr. Dooley before the commission and no communication of any kind

has since been received from him." The Commission thenrproceeds

(although nowhere is there any evidence that any form of land claim

"was presented to it by the Indians or by any attorney representing

them) to state the nature of the claim of the Indians for surplus
lands as set forth in the mentioned contract with Mr. Dooley.
Following a brief discussion of the nature of the claim and the

transactions between the Indians and the defendant under the

treaties of 1825 and 1846, the commission stated:

The conclusion therefore seems inevitable that by’
the treaties of 1825 and 1846, the Kansas Indians, in
consideration of the sums therein agreed to be paid them
or set apart for their benefit. and also in consideration
of the setting apart of another tract of country for their
future residence. relinquished to the United States all
their right and title to the territory they had formerly
claimed and occupied. In this View the commission is
satisfied that there is no legal or equitable basis for
the claim represented by Mr. Dooley. ”

The award of the Ear Commission.made on.specific claims in the
amount of $155,976.88. was. by act of Congress of date March 3. 1905.
appropriated. and the legislation appropriating the same required

that it should.be paid over to the Indians upon the execution by them

,, - 5. ._. -_...:.¢.‘~:

1 Ind. C1. Comm. 608 ' 542

_ 26 of an instrument releasing and relinquishing all claims and demands‘
of every name and nature against the United States; and thereafter
the tribe. in order to secure payment to it of the amount of saidt

award. to wit._$l55,976.88, executed an instrument providing such

release (see Finding No. 11): and this is the release urged by the

defendant as being a complete satisfaction and extinguishment of

J the claims now being asserted.

The act of Congress authorizing the Kaw Commission provides
(section 12) "if the settlement of the claims of said tribe. submitted to said commission (and the accounting) is satisfactory to

the members of said tribe, according to the terms of this agreement.
within one year after the report of said commission is made.”
The defendant thereupon.became the trustee in.possession of

the sum so awarded said plaintiff as satisfaction and extinguishment
of the specific claims submitted to said Commission for determination.
and the requirement made by it, before it would.pay said amount of
$155,976.88. that the Indians execute a general release of all claims
(Finding No. ll), was legal duress, and in the opinion of this Commission.makes said release ineffective as a release of the claims

herein sued'upon. Ingram vs. Lewis, 32 Fed, 2d ggg; petition for‘
grit of certiorari denied by Sun, Ct., 282 U. So Bbg, 25 L: Ed. ZQZ.

In any event. the only consideration for the release hereinabove

discussed was the payment of the sum of $155,976.88 which had been

J. Ind. Cl. Comm. 608 7 ' 643
.. 27 ..appropriated by said act of March 3. 1905 to settle said award
_ of the Kaw Commission in said amount and in full settlement of

all claims, which defendant contends includes those under consideration here, which the Kansas or Kaw Indians had against the
‘United States; and under the findings herein made of value of the
lands for which the plaintiff is entitled to compensation over and
above that heretofore had, the amount of $155,976.88 so paid for
such release was so grossly inadequate as to constitute an unconscionable consideration.‘

The release is held not to be a discharge or extinguishment

of the claims sued on.

Award

 

From the above. it follows that plaintiff is entitled to an
award in the sum of $2;493.688.75, less such offsets, if any. as
:may hereafter be allowed in accordance with section 12 of the

General Enles of Procedure of the Commission.

Commissioners 0‘Harr and Holt concur in the above opinion.
