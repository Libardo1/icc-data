individual plainti.€‘fs James L &noke and Joshua Sanford who are Winnebago Indians living in Wisconsin. This action is brought in a repre-»
sentative capacity by the above plaintiffs and in behalf of all

descendants of ‘r!mebar=‘o»es who were members of the Winneba o Tribe and

Nation of Indians as originally constituted and at the time said Tribe

or Nation participated in the aforementioned treaties of cession and
the important‘ 1825 ‘Prairie du Chien trea.ty‘.

The identity of the Winnebagoes as a tribe of American Indians
living within the continental United States has been knozm since 1631;
when Jean Nicollet, a Frenchman, made the first recorded contact. At
that time they were living around the Green Bay area in Wisconsin. They
have always been associated with the State of Wisconsin throughout their
tribal history until comparatively recent times when a reservation was
created for them in Nebraska. They are further identified as being. of
the Siouan linguistic family.

After Nicollet's initial encounter the Winnebagoes enjoyed more
frequent contact wit: the Jesuit missionaries and the French traders
througxout the 17th and l8th centuries. ‘Ii-Jhen Fraiace finally lost its
colonial foothold  Canada to Great Britain, the Wpinnebagoes quickly

allied themselves with tb British. so strong did their bonds or

 allegiance grow, that, during both the American Revolution and thewar

oi‘ 1812, they actively joined the British forces in fighting the

American troops.

Q} F

After cessation of hostiiities in l8lh,,, the United States sought
to conclude a peace treaty 1-rith the Winrtebagoes. This was not accomplished however until 1816, when the first of a series of treaties
was concluded at St. Louis, Missouri. Thereafter, the United States
negotiated some nineitreaties with the E-finnebagoes, ending with the
Treaty of March 8, 1865 (ll; Stato 671).»

_Having ceded all their lands east of the Mississippi in prior
years, the majority of.‘ the tribe removed to the reservation which had
been set asidefor them in Nebraska under the prcttisions of the 1865 »
treaty. Atuthe same time many Ninnebagoes'~fefused to leave their 
cestral homes in Wisconsin and join their tribal brethren on the
Nebraska reservation. After a highly unsuccessful removal attempt,
attended with great hardship and suffering to the Indians, the United
States: never “again made any serious effort to displace the Wisconsin .
Wiimebagoes. Today manyiof their descendants in sigrrifiecant numbers
are still, residing in Wisconsin.

'.Ehe_ _individ'aa1 plaintiffs are descendants of members of the Winnebago Tribe: and Nation of Indians  originally tconstitazt-ed. and as existed
du-V5-1’18 ‘treaty times pertinent to the issues herein. As such these
plaintiffs satisfy the j'ar5.sdictional requirements of Section 10 of the

du Chien Treaty, or else upon good Indian title perfected by'aboriginal

use and occupancy until ceded by'treatye The question of a recognized
or reservation title, as this Commission has pointed out on prior
occasions, is fundamentally a legal proposition, It involves a correct
interpretation of some treaty, statute, or agreement which would demonn
strate Congressional intent to make such a grants If such be the case

and the question is resolved in favor of the Winncbagoes, the burden of

cproving aboriginal title to the same area is, of course, eliminated.

The Iowa Tribes, et al., v, United States, 7 Ind. C1. Comm. 98.

 

This Commission has on at least three occasions,passed upon the
title recognition aspects of the 1825 Prairie du Chien Treaty, The
Indians involved.in those three cases were the Iowa Tribe and the Sac
and Foxes. In each case the question.was resolved in favor of die

Indians and against the governments Iowa Tribes, et al., v.'United

 

   

States, supra; Sac and Fox Tribes of Indians of Oklahoma, et ai., v.

United States, 5 Ind. Cl. Comm. 367; Otce and Nissouria Tribe of Indians,

   

et ale, V3 United States, 5 Ind. Cl. Comma 316. Viewing the language

   

in the 1825 Treaty as it pertains to the Winnebagoes’ claim.of title
recognition in light of our prior decisions and the reasoning behind
them, it is the Commission's considered opinion that a stronger case
for recognized title can.be made out in favor of thepresent plaintiffs.
There is little doubt that the prime purpose of the 1825 Prairie

du Chien Treaty was the establishment of boundary lines between the
participating tribes which the Indian tribes and the United States*would and did recognize, Of those Indians who knew their boundary

8 Indo Clo Com.  

claims, the areas so described were set down with reasonable accuracy
and incorporated into the treaty. If a tribe had serious doubts of the
extent of its claim, no defini cion was attempted or forced upon the
Indians; Instead a provision was made for settlement at some future
dates h‘Titness_the situaoion of the Menominee Tribe whose territoriali
claimswere left open for further settlemento (Article 89 7 State. 272%

I In the case oi“ the Iowa Tribe and the Sac and Foxes, Article 3 of
the 1823 treaty proirided for joint occupancy of a large defined area
"until some satisfactory arrangement can be made between them for a
division  their respective claims." (irta 33 7 State 272). Neverthea
less, the Commission found that :E'ailure to define the specific area
which each tribe occupied did not defeat the respective claims of title
recognition. In thepinstant case the bounded area of the Winnebago,
with one eocception, which we will discuss hereafter, was clearly defined
and agreed upon byjthe signatory tribes. I

 ' I.'oo'king;first at Article 5 of the treaty  which we find an‘
agreement ‘between the  and Chippewas relative  Sioux boundaries,
there is establi shed indirectly the ‘northwest boundary.  ie of the
Winnebago claims  Royce Cession 21:5. The Sioux _Tribe are situated
immediately northwest of the Winnebago es, and the common boundary line
between these two begins at the mouth of the Black fiver and runs to
3 Point ‘estimated to be a half’ day's march below the Chipnewa Ifalls.‘
(Art. 5; 7 Stat. 272, Commission”s Finding 13)

Then in Article 6 of the treaty there is an agreement between the

W5-nnebagoes and their northem neighbors _., the Chippewas, as to the common

bounda-T3’ line between their respective countries, which l.'.ne is more

...._......_.—-...- _ .

accurately represented as the extreme northern line of Royce Cession
215. (Art. 6, 7 Stat. 272, Commission‘s Finding 11:.)

finally, in Article 7 of the treaty, as set out below, agreement
is reached aznong a_l the tribes (with the exception of the Menominees),

and the limits of what is appropriately termed ‘Winnebago Country" are

- fixed in great detail consistent with the preceding articles, except for

an indeterminate line running from the Black River:

It is agreed between the I.-Iinnebagoes and the Sioux,
Sacs and Foxes, Chippewas and Ottai-ras , Chippewas and
Potawatomies of the Illinois, that the Winnebago country
shall be bounded as follows: south easterly by Rock fiver,
from its source near the Winnebago lake, to the Winnebago
‘village, about forty miles above its mouth; westerly by
the east line of the tract lying upon the Mississippi,
herein secured to the Ottax-Ia, Chippewa and Potawatcmie 8
Indians of the Illinois 3 and also by the high bluff, deescribed in the Sioux boundary, and running north to Black
river; from this point the winnebagces claim up Black river,
to a point due west from the source of the left fork of the
0uisconsin3 thence to the source of the shid fork, and down
the same to the Ouisconsins thence down the Ouisconsin to
-the portage, and across the portage to Fox river; thence
dovm Fox river to the Winnebago lake, and to the grand Kan
Kanlin, including in their claim the whole of Winnebago
lake; but, for the causes stated in the neirt article, this
line from Black river mast for the present be left indenterminate.

This area encompasses the three continguous tracts, Royce 1149, I71; aid
21:5 (Commission's Finding 15).

With the participating tribes having agreed generally to ‘abide by
and recognize the treaty lines so fixed, only the assent of Congress to
bind the Chi ted States in like manner is needed to complete the recognition
picture. Keeping in mind the overall purposes of the 1825 treaty, the

Commission is of the o inion that the requisite Congressional intent to
P .

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 78 107

give recognition is clearly manifcstedy in the plain and unequivocal
language in Article 10 of the treaty which reads in part:
”. . . And the United States agree to, and recognize,
the preceding boundaries, subject to the limitations and
restrictions before provided. . ." (Art. 10, 7 State 272)
The Connuisisiony therefore believes that the Winnebago Tribe, being
a party to the 1825 Prairie du Chien Treaty and having its territorial
boundaries fizkzed with reasonable accuracy and agreed upon by the other
participating tribes as well as theUnited States, is entitled to share
in the recognition benefits conferred by the said treaty, and we therev fore find the wizmebago Tribe had a title recognized by the United States
to the two tracts designated as Royce Cession. lh9, which it ceded under
the Treaty of. August 1, 1829 (7 Sisat. 323) and Royce Cession 1714 which
it ceded under the Treaty of September 15,’ 1832 (7 Stat. 370).

 In addition we find that «under the 1825 Prairie du Chien Treaty

 the United States recognized Wirmebago title to all of Royce Cession

_ 9113 with the exception of that area which we have designated in our

i findings as the "Menominee Overlap." This area involved the indeterIrdnate portion of the 1~Iinnebago boundary line established under Article 7

 or the 1825 Treaty.

Brieflyithe situation was as follows. The Menominee, iwho occupied

‘  3. region northeast of the Winnebagoes, were unprepared at the 1825 Treaty
todefine the extent of their territorial claims , particularly those

Wes :ard. In order not to do them an injustice or foment any future
trouble, it was thought best at the time to axbj ect the areas already

£3-?‘?C=.:1 to a future determination of the extent of the I*1en.o;-uin.ee territorial

8 Indo Clo COIT1o  

claims , when a more accurate description could be supplied. This provision was peculiarly applicable to the adjoining Chippewa and Winnebago lands. Since the Menominee Tribe entertained a general claim westward to the Black River, both the Winnebagoes and the Chippewas were put
ongnotice that there existed a genuine Menominee overlap within their
respective areas, subject to a more accurate determination at some future
date.

Six years lateron Februariurs 8, 1831, the United States concluded
a treety__ (7 Stat. 3142) with the Menominee in which the territorial
claims oi‘ the Indians were set out. The extent of the "Menominee Overlap”
 Royce 215, was then fixed, knowingly or unknowingly, insofar as
the l82S‘Prairie du Chien Treaty was concerned. As far as can be determined the Winnebagoes made no visible protest as to the extent of the
Menominee claims within their territory, nor was this in issue when p
thepwinnebago,  1837, ceded all of Royce Cession 2115 without further
description of its metes and bounds. Generally speaking, this ‘Menominee
Overlap" within Royce Cession 215 includes all of that area north of the
"Ivianoy" ‘or Lemonweir I-liver, a more accurate description of which is set
out in the Commission's Finding 21.

On October 18, 181:8, the Menominee Tribe ceded to the United States
all its lands in Wisconsin wherever situated (9 State 952). Four years
later the Senate of the United States inquired into the adequacy of the
consideration paid to the Menominees for their lands acquired un.der the
18118 Treaty.

The Senate concluded that the total acreage oi‘ the Menominee

owned lands was grossly underestimated, since there was a failure to

There is hardl * more than a scintilla of evidence in‘icating Winne-=~
bago use and O=3Cf‘£:paI;-313" of any par’; of Royce Cession 1215 prior to 1800.,
What there is shows  establishment of one village just within the
extreme southeastern part around 17930 The evidence from 1800 to 1825
of Winnebago use and occupanzzgg including alleged hunting activity, falls
far short of even the m:§_ni1rrom proof which might be considered adequate
for establishing aboriginal title to any part of Royce 21156 As to that
portion involvi.ng the "Menominee Overlap" north of the Lemonweir River ,
no Winnebago villages can be found, and any other tribal use of the area
relative to hunting at least up until a few years before the 1837 treaty
of cession, is purely conjectural.

Therefore, the Commission concludes that the plaintiffs have the

 right and capacity under our Act to bring and maintain this suit for

and in baalf of all the descendants of the Winnebago Tribe and Nation

of Indians as originally constituted and" as it existed during the pertinent
treaty years, and that by virtue of the 1825 Prairie du Chien Treaty, the
Winnebago Indians had a recognized title to those lands set forth in
Article 7 thereof exclusive of the "I~1enorrd’.nee Overlap," a more accurate
description of which is set forth in the Commission's Finding 32. Further,
we find that the United States acquired all of the plaintiffs’ right, title,
and interest in the su'oject lands under three separate treaties, concluded
in 1829, 1832, and 1837.

Having ruled favorably on plaintiffs‘ title claims to the subject

lands as set forth in the Commission‘s Finding 32 , we shall reserve
