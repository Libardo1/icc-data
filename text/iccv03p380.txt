OPINION or was COMMISSION __

 

O‘L{a.rr, Oozzmissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.

In this cause the defendant has filed its motion for summasy judgment based ugon the grounds:

1. That the defendant is entitled to judgment as a. matter of law

because the petition does not state a claim upon which an award may be

granted .

2. That the issues here involved were judicially determined in a

prior case between the same @ties and involving the same subject matter

- - _ _. 4
. _  .. ‘_'__::_‘-._-___;;'
 by the Court of Claims in Shoshone Tribe v. United" States, No. E-219,

  reported in 82 0. (113. 23 and s5 0. Cls. 331, which is res judicata

‘S.-‘ as to the claim here presented.

 _ Inusupport of this ground, defendant has offered_a record of the

 proceedings before the Court of Claims in the former case which is not

'. _  ' questioned by petitioner and which is sufficient to show the issues be  ‘? fore said court and the basis for its determination of the former case.

 3. That the Commission is without jurisdiction to entertain the

  . claim because provisions of the jurisdictional act under which the former
  case was decided, bar as settled and cancelled the claim here asserted.
; M   The claim here asserted is for the raise  sold taken from the
   southern part of the Shoshone ‘Reservation between _Ju.ly 3, 1868, 15 Stat.
.  iii‘  673, when the Shoshone acquired the reservation, and the time the Indians.
  ceded that part of it by the Agreement of September 26, 1872, 18 Stat. 291,
    approved December 15 , _~1s71;. ~ ' — - 3 ; ;_
  The other claim set forth in the petition, being that based upon an
 3  alleged improper allowance of offsets in the former case, was abandoned
 L;  ‘by the petitioner at_ the oral argument of the moti on, and since the Com  mission agrees with counsel for petitioner that it is without merit, it

will be dismissed.

 . By Article 2. of the "£reaty of July 3, 1868, the United States ceded

 to the Shoshone some 3,000,000 acres of land, including that from which

' '8  the gold as taken, and agreed that such land -. .. ‘ - .,. ,_ I’ ._ . _

Throughout the li tigation identified in paragraph 15

 of this cause of action petitioner consistently asserted its

claims for the gold so wrongfully removed from its lands prior
to the 1872 Brunet taking. The Court of Claims in its decision
of December 2, 1935, 82 Ct. Cl. 23, rejected petitioner‘s claim

 in the follo-sing language (pp. 1&1-2 of decision): "‘ "' "‘

Because of said erroneous decision of the Court of Claims
petitioner was paid nothing, under the finaljudgnent in said

fact the owners of the minerals in and underlying said lands.
(Shoshone Tribe v. United States, 3014 U. s. 111, 82 L. ed.

1213, 55 s. 0. 791+.)

_ 15. Said. wrongful action of defendant is actionable under
Section 2 of the Indian Claims Comission Act as (l) a claim
in equity arising under the Constitution; (2) a claim sounding
in tort with respect to which claimant would have been entitled
to sue in a court of the United States if the United States was
subject to suit; (3) a claim which would result if the agreement between claimant and the United States was revised on the
ground of unconsci onable consideration or unilateral mistake;
(1%) a claim arising from a taldng by the United States of lands
owned by claimant without the payment for such lands of compensation agreed to by claimant; and (5) a claim based on fair and honor. -able dealings that are not recognized by any em'sting rule of law

or equity.

19. By reason of the matters and things «aforesaid petitioner
is entitled to ,judgment’aga.inst the United States for the value
of the gold wrongully removed from the reservation prior to the
ratification date of the Brunot 1872 taking in the sum of
$1,106,750, with interest thereon at a reasonable rate from 1872
to date of judgment as a part of just compensation. '

_ @3303?” petitionerprays judgnent against defendant on this
its First Cause of Action for the sum of $1,106,750, together
with interest thereon from l8?2 to date of judgent and for such
further relief as to the Commission may seem -just and equitable.

It is the above allegations of the petition we must look to in harder

to determine the nature of the claim asserted, and for which recovery is

asked, since they are the only allegations that state the facts upon

which the claim is predicated.

Counsel for the Government seem to be of the opinion that the present

petition is based upon the erroneous decision of the Court of Claims in

‘holding (p. 85 of 82 C. Cls. Q3) that the Shoshone “were not the legal

or beneficial owners of the mineral rights.“

erroneous decision of the Court of Claims petitioner was paid nothing,
‘under the final ,judg:nentj_in said litigation, for the value of the gold

"' "‘ .' If those allegations were accepted as indicating the basis for
the claim we would be inclined to agree ‘that they state no actionable
claim, ‘but we consider them as a mere statement of the effect of the
Court of Claims decision and are of little significance except, perhaps,
as an allegation that the Shoshone received nothing for the goldremoved
As we view the petition, and considering it as a
_whole,' the gravamen of the claim is .set forth in paragraph 16- thereof

and alleges a claim for the -gold taken from the Shoshone lands while they

were the rightful possessors of the sane.
Sufficienczl of Petition‘,

The Government contends that the mining of the gold, even if done
in violation ‘of its_solemn_agreeznent with the Shoshone (Article 2 of the
1868 treaty) which provides that no persons, except certain desiaated

persons and government representatives, "shall ever ‘be permitted ‘to pass
over, settle upon, or reside in the territory described in this article
for the use of said Indians," is not a compensahle wrong. citing in support
of their contention: E62 Perce v. United States, 95 0. Ole. 1;_ Greek
Ration v.,United States, 318 U. s, 629; and several__other cases decided
by the Court of Claims and the Supreme Court. ~The two cases first cited

hold in effect that provisions such as those in the 1858 treaty with the

Shoshone, ‘by which the Government agrees to insm'e the exclusive use and

quiet enjoyment of their lands, does not make the Govement liable in
damages for encroachments on Indian lands by unauthorized persons even
though the agreed protection was inadequate.

We would be inclined to agree -.-rith the Government's contentions

if the alleged facts were limited to trespasses of the character involved

‘in those cases. but the allegations here_are that the Government in violation ofits duty to prevent trespassing actively participated “in

protecting said trespassing miners in their operations.“ Admittedly,

these allegations are general and vague, and should be made more definite,

but they do suggest that the Government, by protecting the trespassing
miners  some way not disclosed, became a party. to the wrongdoing.
Bearing in mind that we are here considering a pleading only and must
give effect to such ultimate facts as can be inferred by reasonable
intendment from its allegations, we cannot say as a ‘matter of law that
the petition does not state a cause of action. Torts, for instance,
when committed ‘by the Government, are actionable under clau.se_ (2) of
section 2 of the Indian Claims Commission Act. So if the Shoshone intend to base its claim upon the participation of the Government in the

activities of the tresPassing miners in such a way as to make the Government liable as a wrongdoer --- in contrast to a claim predicated npon the
mere failure or neglect of the Government to comply with its treaty
obligations to prevent trespassing -— the facts should be pleaded with
such certainty, definiteness and fullness that the Commission can determine the nature of the claim and that will enable the Government to prePare and plead its defense.

_A case was filed by the Shoshone Tribe in the Courtpof Claims, being

the same party as the petitioner herein, under a jurisdictional act
(March 3, 1927, _m-L Stat. 13349) authorizing the Court of Claims "to hear,
examine, adjudicate, and render judgment in any  all legal and
equitable claims which the Shoshone Tribe of Indians of the Wind River
Reservation in the State of Wyoming may havelahgainst the United States
arisingunder or growing out of the treaty of July 3, 1868 (Fifteenth
Statutes, page 673), or arising under or growing out of any subsequent
treaty or agreement between said Shoshone Tribe of Indians and the
United States or any subsequent Act of Congress effecting said tribe,
which claims have not heretofore been determined and adjudicated upon
their_merits by the Court of Claims or the Supreme Sourt of the United

States.“

On September 30, 1931, the; Shoshone filed their amended petition in

1-zhich were set forth several causes of anti on, among which was a claim

for gold taken from their reservation by citizens of the United States.

In their petition (Def. Ex. 1, p._ 5}. after setting forth the provisions

of Article 2, which we have quoted above, alleged:

"Notwithstanding this solemn treaty stipulation, and with the
mowledge on the part of the United States that certain portions
of the land within the limits of petitioner‘ s reservation contained valuable deposits of-gold, and other precious metals, the
United States permitted and encouraged citizens of the United
States, against the protest of petitioner, to intrude, settle,
reside upon, and mine and take away large amounts of gold belonging to petitioner to the loss and damage of petitioner in the

sum of $1,106,750.00.” S

._..-'._. .-...:j-..._p-_n— -——- -. .On Hovember 9, 1931, defendant therein filed a ‘general traverse (Def.

Ex. 1, p. 9) and the case was tried on the issues thus made, and a

Judgment was entered on December 2, 1935, for the Shoshone on one of the

c@ms asserted, but not for the gold claim.

me judment (Def. Ex, 1,

p. 10) did not mention the gold claim, except in the findings of fact

(32 0. 01s. 23, pp. N6-T, Find. 12), so we must go to the opinion of the

court for disposition of the gold claim. is to this claim the court,

at pp. 314-35, said:

a-o --1.-on n

“Ihe evidence is undisputed that a large quantity of gold

was removed from lands lying within the boundaries of the
reservation. The Government admits that gold of the net value
of approximately $350,000 was mined within the reservation,

Upon a consideration of all the evidence contained in the record,
we are of opinion that the maximum value of gold removed from ,
mines located within the limits of the reservation did not
exceed $500,000. However, we deem it unnecessary to discuss
this matter in detail, for the reason that, in our opinion, the
plaintiff cannot recover on this item. Prior "to, and at the

time of the making of the treaty of 1868, gold had been discovered and was being mined in the district mentioned, and the
boundaries of the reservation as fixed by the treaty included
within the reservation a portion of this mining district; in
fact, the most valuable mines in the district were afterwards
found to be located upon‘ the reservation. is a result of this

a commissioner was appointed pursuant to the act of Congress of
June 1, 1872, to negotiate with the plaintiff tribe for the
relinquishment of that portion of the reservation which included
the tunes and all gold-bearing land. Accordingly, an agreement
was entered into between plaintiff tribe and the United States
on September 26, 1372, ratified December 15, 18711» (18 Stat. 291),
in mich the former ceded to the United States, without any
reservations whatever, approximately 700,000 acres of land,
which included all the territory embraced within the boundaries
of the reservation in any way affected by the goldf-mining ,
operations. A. consideration of $27,500, specified in this agreement, was appropriated and paid, with the exception of about $134.

In these circumstances we are not authorized under the jurisdictional

act to reopen this matter. Moreover, the Indian title at the time
this cession was made consisted only of the right to use and occupy
the reservation, and at that time the Indians were not the legal

or beneficialowners of the mineral rights.“

It is the above determination by the Court of Claims in the former suit

the defendant relies on as res judicata. ' there can be no question but
that the court denied the gold claim in that manner, although not expressly by the judgment,
The above case went to the Supreme Court twice and resulted in a

different jmidgnyent, but the geld claim was not involved in any of those
appeals or in the final determination of the Court of Claims, so the

decision referred. to above is the only one affecting the gold. claim, and

‘there was_no appeal from the court's decision on that.

I_t will be seen by a comparison of the allegations of the former

petition with those inuthe instant case, that in. spite of the difference

V in phraseology, the claims are the same, in fact, neither party contends

otherwise. _

It is plain from the opinion that the Court of Claims decided:

(I) that the lS'[2 treaty, which included the gold-bearing lands with
others ceded by that treaty, constituted a bar to the gold claim which
could not be considered under the Jurisdictional act, and (2) , that

in any event, the Shoshone were not the legal or beneficial owners of the
gold.

As_to the first, the court had before it the treaty oi’ 1868, by winch
the Shoshone acquired the lands, and the agreement of l8‘{2, by which they
ceded the area which included the lands from which the gold was mined.

But the jurisdictional question could not be determined by either the

treaty or agreement alone, for, in addition to what the treaty and agreement disclosed, there had to be a finding and determination of consideration

- __ _,.,i,,,'.¢....--_.:-—4-—-—-n.-.-.-u._... for the 1872 cession and that goldwvas removed by intruders from the

ceded. area during the time the Shoshone were the rightful possessors
thereof. And,'as it will be seen, the court by'its Finding 12 (82 C. Cls.
1&6) made such findings, namely, that the consideration paid for the
cession, which included the gold-bearing lands, was $27,500, and that

gold of the value of $500,000 had been removed from the land during

the time the Shoshone were the rightful possessors of it, that is,

"between July 3, 1868, the date of the treaty, and 1871!, when the cession
agreement " * was ratified * * ." We are not called upon to inquire into
the correctness of the court‘s findings ofufact or its decision, in fact,
it would__be inappropriate for us to do so. ‘ It is a. rule, generally accepted, that for a judgment or other
determination of an action to become a bar to a subsequent action between ‘
the same parties on the same claim, the determination in the iiirst case
must have been on the merits. hooicsack ‘Tribe v. United States,_,l Ind,

C. Com. 333, 338;_30 Am. Jur. 9}-I-1!», sec. 208.. So the determinative question
here is whether the disposition of the gold claim by the Court of Claims

in the former case was upon the merits. If it was not, no estoppel arises

and the parties are free to litigate that claim before this Commission.

We have set out above the exact languagedused by the Court of Claims

in disposing of the gold claim.' It there plainly appears that the Court
was of the opinion that the Shoshone, having by the 1872 agreement cededtheir lands, including the gold--bearing land, for $27,500 "without any

reservations whatever,“ were bound by that agreement and that the court

:;;§i§ii2§§ could not under the jurisdictional act reopen such settlement. The court
V7 ’{ ‘if? expressly stated: “In these circumstances we are not authorized under the

S  .' ‘iii 9
:§§;g_£g jurisdictional act to reopen this matter.” So what the court actually
%:€h§§§ decided was that the 1872 agreement constituted a settlement of the gold
Q ‘gig claim. This, we find by looking at the Government‘s brief submitted to
,§;,§ the court, is in.accordance,uith.the position of the Government, for at
“E, Egg page 891 of_the record we find this contention:
iW§§§§E’E . ‘H That the United States entered into a full and complete
¥"~-.;=;‘*:?§ settlement in 1872, with the Shoshone Tribe of Indians, of all

-’7;gw_2lHg,3 difficulties between said tribe and the United States which had

"'i“;r;s,§ ' arisen theretofore in consequence of the occupancy of a portion
’V= j of the Shoshone or Wind.Eiver Reservation by citizens of the United

*§ States, and that amongst the difficulties which.has so arisen

-3 were the intrusion, settlement, and residing upon, and mining

  -F * * (gold claim) any damage which had accrued to plaintiff

*’.i terms of which, the Shoshone ceded to the United States the only
,' ‘portion of the Wind Eiver Reservation in which gold had ever been
.f found in paying quantities. ; '
' , i: It therefore appears beyond question.that the court did.not dispose of the
3:: ii}; gold claim on the merits, but on the jurisdictional ground we have mentioned.

As to the second determination of the Court of Claims, to the effect

that the Shoshone were not the owners of the gold taken from their lands.

it would seem the statements in the opinion must be considered as obiter

dictum for the court in the very same paragraph. and immediately preceding the statement as to non-ownership of the gold, had declared it was

not-_-authorized under the jurisdictional act to consider the gold claim.

That it was not intended by the court to consider the statement as
determinative of the gold claim is supported by the fact that in the
same case (85 Co. Cls. 331, 351). although involving another part of the

reservation. the court in construing Article  of ‘the 1868 treaty, said:

.* * II weere of opinion. that this right to “absolute and

undisturbed use and occupation” of the reservation includes,
as beneficial incidents. :the net value of the land, including
the net value of any timber or minerals‘ within the boundaries

of the reservation. and, so far as we have been able to ascertain,
this View is consistent with the established policy’ of the
government from the beginning of its dealings with the Indian
tribes, the making of‘ treaties providing reservations for them,
and in the management of tribal lands and other affairs of the
Indian tribes at least for several years prior to 1878 and at

all times subsequent thereto. ' i

The above conclusion of the court in the latter decision was based upon
extended research and discussion of the law relating to the benleficial
incidents arising from absolute use and occupancy granted Indians by
treaties such as that of 1868. The mineral rights of the Shoshone were,
of course, ‘derived from the treaty of 1868. The Supreme Court in affirming the Court of Claimssaidt ‘

i'The lower court did not err in holding that the right of the.

Shoshone Tribe included the timber and minerals within the reservation.‘ United States v. Shoshone, 301} U. S. 1.11, 82 L. Ed. -1213.

Section 3 of the jurisdictional act under which the former suit was

‘brought (Act of March 3, 1927, 113+ Stat-.' l3L|9) contains this provision:

._"' "' * In reference to all claims which may be the subject’
matter of the suits herein authorized. the decree of -the court
shall be in full settlement of all damages. if any, committed
by the Government of the United States and shall annul and cancel
all claim, right, and title of the said Shoshone Indians in and to
such money, lands, or other property.

,The Government contends that these provisions ‘bar a consideration of

the gold claim ’o;=_r this Commission, the argument being that decision of

the Court of Claims disposed of the claim and it was therefore not in

:existence when the Indian Claims Commission Act was passed. This argument

is ‘cased upon the notion that the ccart in the former case disposed of the

gold claim on'the merits. But since we hold the claim was not so terminated

the argument must fall. It will ‘be noticed that the decree which is made I

to be in full settlement of damages and "annul and cancel all claim, right,

and title of said Shoshone Indians in and to snchmoney. land or other

From the above it follows the motion must be denied.

I cannot agree with the holding of my colleagues overruling
the First Cause of Action asserted by petitioner. I am of the
opinion that this cause of action has been previously determined.
adversely to the petitioner by the Court of claims as reported in
82 o. cls. 23, pp. 1:6-7, V ind.i]_.2, and that the defendant's plea
of res Judicata as to same should be sustained.

The opinion of my colleagues says that the claims as asserted
in the Court of Claims case and in the instant case Itare the same"
and that “neither party contends otherwise.“ In the majority
opinion it is further stated:

V It is plain from the opinion that the court of

claims decided: (1) that the 1872 treaty, which included

the gold-bearing lands with others ceded by .that treaty,

constituted a bar to the gold claim which could not be

considered under the jurisdictional act, and (2), that in i

any event, the Shoshone were not the legal or beneficial
owners of the gold.

My colleagues , however, conclude that the decision of the Court
of Claims was not based on the merits of the case, and that therefore
petitioner is entitled to maintain the claim filed with the Indian
Claims Commission. While it is to-oe that the Court of Claims said
that it did not have ,'jn.risdiction to go into the facts as to the duty
owed by the defendant to the petitioner in respect to the alleged
unlawful mining of gold and the cooperation and encouragement given
to the minors to mine the same —- this statement is really obiter
dictum because the Court said that whatever’ liability the defendant

might have been under to the petitioner with reference to the gold
