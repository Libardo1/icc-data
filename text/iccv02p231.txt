PER CURIAM. Ehis hmtter comes ‘before the Commission on a notion
of the defendant, filed herein on Januaw 25, 1952, todismiss the petition on three grounds. the of said grounds are (1) that the plaintiffs
are not a. “tribe, hand or other identifiable group of American Indians“;
and (2) that the claims asserted are individual and not group claims,

hence, this Commission has no jurisdiction to entertain the claim set

forth in the petition.

First, it may ‘be stated that the motion is based entirely upon

an no. ‘-0 -Ithe allegations of fact set forth in the petition; at least insofar as

-O‘

the above grounds are concerned,

‘;The claim.is asserted by the Cherokee Freedman, Cherokee Freedmen’s
.Association, and five named individuals who, it is alleged, are Cherokee
‘yFreedmen and make claim for themselves and all Cherokee Freedman for the
value of properties and.money of the Cherokee Nation wrongfully withheld

.from the Cherokee Freedmen.

It is alleged in the petition that Article 9 of the treaty of July
19, 1856, between the Cherokee Nation of Indians_and the United States,
provides: 7
They further agree that all freedmen who have been
liberated by voluntary act of their former owners or by
law, as well as all free colored persons who mere in the
country at the commencement of the rebellion and are now

residents therein, or who may return within six.months,
and their descendants, shall have all the rights of native

.Cherokees. j

And that the Freedman referred to in the treaty were adopted by the
amended Constitutioncf the Cherokee Nation and.haye been continuously
thereafter recognized by the United States Government and by statute as
Cherokee Freednen, and that they and their descendants were'by said treaty
and Constitution given equal rights as citizens and equal interest in the

Pr0Perty of the Cherokee Nation and all rights of the Cherokee Indians by

blood,

It is further alleged that rolls of the Cherokee Freedman were made
at various times pursuant to the treaty, statutes, decree of court, etc..
so those who constitute such group can be identified. And in paragraph 15

of the petition it is alleged:

‘ Plaintiffs allege that the Commission to the Five Civilized
Tribes and the Secretary of Interior, as agents and representatives of the Defendant, entered upon their duties prescribed by.
Congress, but in violation.of the trust imposed upon them they
wholly disregarded their powers, obligations and duties; assumed
authority not given to them, and so administered said trust as
to result in discrimination, misrepresentation, duress, collusion
and fraud as against these plaintiffs and their ancestors; that
they wrongfully, fraudulently and unlawfully refused to accept
and consider the membership rolls of the Freedmen.theretofore
authorized by Congress, and Opinion of the Court of Claims February 3, 1896 supra), which were approved and confirmed by the
Tribe and the Secretary of the Interior, and reconfirmed by Congrese; that without notice or warning, they illegally and without
authority entirely eliminated Cherokee Freedman from the tribal
rolls or refused to accept their applications for allotments of
lands and payments of money to which they were lawfully entitled;
that they arbitrarily and without notice or authority and without
regard to the_rights of the Freedmen, set up their own plan of
distributing or alloying the lands belonging to the Cherokee
Nation in which these plaintiffs and their ancestors were entitled
to participate as lawful.members of the Tribe, .As a result of the
aforesaid acts, misdeeds and improper and illegal conduct of Defendant's agents and representatives, plaintiffs and their ancestors,
were deprived of their property, and the lawful right to participate
in the property of the Cherokee Indian Tribe, for all of which Defendant should account to Plaintiffs. i‘

And in paragraph l6 of the petition it is alleged that, as a result of the
Unlawful and fraudulent acts of defendant and its agents and representatives, as alleged, that with the exception of a favored few Cherokee
Freedman, plaintiffs suffered loss of property and money of the Cherokee

Nation to which they were entitled.

We believe, therefore, that insofar as the allegations in the pleading
are concerned, the plaintiffs have shown.themselves to be a.group entitled
to maintain.the claim under the ruling of the«Court of Claims in McGhee,
at 31 V. Creek ation and United States, lél C. Cls. , decided

may 6. 1952. Whether the claim is individual or common can only be determined.by proof upon a.hearing of evidence which of course is not before

the ‘Commission. . ihe plaintiffs must, of course, prove that they have
a cmon claim. V " - ' ' j 7

y_ Ehe tmrd g~ound for dismissal is: The Commission lacks Jurisdiction
in that the attorney had not and has not authority to file the petition
herein or to appear herein because his contract has not been approved by

the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. ‘

The facts are, as shown by the records in the custody of the Clerk
of this Commission, that the claim of the plaintiffs was filed herein by
Walter E. Maloney, attorney, ‘on June 13, 1951, and at the same time _the
said attorney filed copies -of two contracts, duly executed, dated October N-, l91L9, by which he 'was employed by the Cherokee Freed.men's Association. In some respects there are substantial differences between the two.
contracts, however, it fairly appears from the contracts and the resolutions of the Cherokee Freedmenis Association attached thereto, that said
‘Walter H. Maloney was employed, as an attorney, to prosecute claims before
this Commission of the group of colored persons ifzho by virtue of theprovisions of the treaty of July 19, 1866 (11; Stat, 799) and the provisions of

the Constitution of the Cherokee Nation became members and citizens of

said Nation. 91113 group became historically and officially known as the

Cherokee Freedman.

the Cherokee Freedmen‘s Association, “consisting of the legal members
of the original Cherokee Nation of Indians “their descendants and
°°1°1‘9—‘3~ Persons and their descendants, as better described in Article 9
of the treaty by and between the United States, and the Cherokee Nation

-'O —_.au..I—. ‘-v1vh_—— ..-___-——-u--is, as it fairly appears from the above and by the statements signed

by three representatives of said association attached _to said contracts,
dated May 29, 1951, an organization of Cherokee Freedmen created for
the purpose, among others, to handle the prosecution of claims of the
Cherokee_Freedmen against the United States before this Commission.

While such association appears as one of the party plaintiffs, we do

inot consider that fact important because there are other parties, namely,

the Cherokee Freedmen (which is a name descriptive of the grow of
colored people who became part of the Cherokee Nation, referred to above)
and five individual plaintiffs who are so—called Cherokee Freedmen and

sue ina representative capacity. There is certainly no allegation in

the petition showing that the Cherokee Freedmen’s Association has any

claim, so that name, as a party plaintiff may be considered as surplusage,
but this does not mean it may not act as agent or representative. for the
Cherokee Freedmen in the handling and prosecution of this claim. Since
there is nothing to show otherwise, we presume it was and is so acting
and, that being so, it may employ legal counselfor that purpose, but

the contracts therefor must be in_writing and approved by the Commissioner

of Indian ‘Affairs. (25 U.S.C.A. 70(n); 25 U.S.,C.A. 81, 3, s. 2103).

The contracts for legal services are, as we have stated above, different in some respects and are not in many ways like other contracts
for such services approved by the Commi ssionen of Indian Affairs, but
irrespective of that, a contract such as those above is void unless
3PProved by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs (the authority of the

Secretary of the Interior having been delegated to the Commissi oner of

Indian Affairs) as reomlred by Sec. 81, 25 U,S.C.A. (R. S. sec. 2103), See
Pueblo of Santa. Rosa v. Fall, 273 U. S. 315. And under the ruling in that

case this claim could be dismissed, since it has been shown that no_ such

a approval has been obtained, as is required by Section 15 of the Indian

Claims Commission Act and 25 17.3.0 .11.. 81.

Here we permitted to dismiss this claim without prejudice, we believe

we would be required to do so under the Santa Rosa. case, supra, but a

dismissal now, because the time limit for receiving claims has long since

‘expired, might deprive the plaintiffs of the right to again submit their
‘claim. We, therefore, feel ‘justified in reserving action on the motion
relating to the attorney's contract until Decemberujl, 1952, in order

that an approved attorney's contract may be obtained.

Fe note that the sole reason advanced by the Commi ssioner of Indian

L‘ Affairs (letter of June 20, l95l, attached to defendant's motion) for not

3-PP%1'°Y5+11§ the attorney's contract is that the Chero‘.-cee Freedmen are not
an Indian tribal entity, that is, the Cherokee freedmen is not a tribe,
band or identifiable group of American Indians. In view of the fact that
we are overruling defendant’s motion on the other grounds, both of which
involve their capacity to sue, the plaintiffs may see fit to  submit

acontract to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for his consideration.

It follows that defendant’s motion must be overruled as to the
first and second grounds and the ruling on the third ground reserved

until after December 31, 1952.
