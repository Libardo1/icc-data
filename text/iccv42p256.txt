BEFORE THE INDIAN CLAIMS COMMISSION

THE SIOUX TRIBE, et al.,

Plaintiffs,

v. Docket No. 74

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

V-/N/Va/\J‘u./‘Nu/\-/Nu/N-I

Defendant.

ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION

UPON CONSIDERATION of the plaintiffs’ motion requesting "an order
that no offsets, either payments on the claim or gratuities be deducted"

from the award in this case, filed August 19, 1976; defendant's reply
thereto filed August 30, 1976; defendant's motion for the admission of

evidence filed November 26, 1976; the oral arguments held before the
Comission on October 12, 1976, and January 14, 1977, and for the reasons
set forth in the opinion accompanying this order; the Commission concludes

as a matter of law that

1+ the defendant may not offset any part of the cost of the goods
and services it promised the Sioux under the 1868 treaty as payments on

plaintiffs’ claim in this docket, and

2- the course of dealings between the United States and the Sioux
was such that the Commission cannot in good conscience offset any gratuitous
expenditures by the United States against plaintiffs‘ award in this docket.

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that plaintiffs’ motion of August 19, 1976,
be, and the same hereby is, granted.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that no offsets, either payments on the claim
or gratuitous, shall be deducted from the award in this case.

Dated at Washington, D. C., this 12th day of July 1978
