Since the Commission by its decision and finding of March 3, 1956,
rejected the Caddo claim.to that portion of Royce Cession 202 above the
Sulphur River in Arkansas, plaintiffs have sought repeatedly to have the
Commission reverse its finding in regard to said land. Plaintiffs‘ counsel

in the heat of partisanship has labeled t.e fi

arbitrary and capricious, and it is because of this that reference is here
made to the claims of plaintiffs to lands above the Sulphur River in Arkansas?

Nachitcches to Governor Miro: I

The Great Caddo tribe of Indians found itself
obliged two years ago to change the location of its
village on account of the continual war'being waged
upon them by'the Osage tribe. Being persecuted
incessantly by their enemies, these Indians were
obliged last month to take refuge in the village of
the Little Caddo (P. 3?. P1. Ex. 78).

_2_/ John Sibley, Ffatchitoches, April 5,1805:

Caddoques ~ Live about thirtyafive miles west
of the main branch of Red River, on a bayou or creek,
called by them, Soda, which is navigable for piroques
only, within about six miles of their village, and that
only'in the rainy qeason. They are distant from
Natchitoches about l2O miles, the nearest route by land,
and in nearly a northwest position. They'have lived
where they now do, only five years. The first year they
moved there, the smell pox got amongst them, and destroyed
nearly one half of them; ..... They fermerly lived on the
south bank of the river, by the course of the river 375 miles
higher up ..... which had been the residence of their ancestors
from time immemorial ....." (P. 721, American State Papers,
Vol. IV).

The Caddos reside 50 miles from the Coashuta village,
on a small creek, which empties into a lake tlat communiu

eleven years since they fixed on that place for their
residence. They formerly lived on the riter, in a large

These exhibits which plaintiffs‘ counsel has gathered in one volume
and identified as KC l—96 and HCFF lulh have been examined and analyzed.

Of the exhibits. appraximately fcriyufive had a;ready been admitted into

reports which he placed in the record, but t: the extent pplioable to the
issue are merely cu. l*tive. In addition there are twenty-five documents
which are photcstats of selected cash entries in the records of the United
States Land Office in Eaehingtcns Arkansas, covering the period from l8h0

to l8h3. These exhibits pirpcrt to shsw that in the post treaty years some
twenty-five individuals sought to perfect their titles under applicable
preemption statutes to certain tracts on pdblic lands, which tracts averaged
about one hundred sixty acres and'were located for the most part on the south
side of the Red River within Royce Cession 202. No showing is made as to how
these post treaty preemption sales are material to the question of establishing
Caddo Indian title to an’ portion of the ceded area.

Of the remaining exhibits, plaintiffs’ counsel has placed a great deal

of emphasis upon a continuing article by Dr. Rex‘H. Strickland appearing in

the'Harch l9hO and Harsh l9hl editions of the Chrcnicles of Oklahoma. In

governing rules. Such relevancy as it has would not produce a different

result if the Commission granted a rehearing to admit such as not already
ll/
in evidence. In fact this Commission thinks plaintiffs‘ MC 1-96 gives

additional support to the Commission's previous holding. One need only to
look again at the aforementioned article by Dr. Strickland to find the
following statement which sums up quite appropriately the overall Caddo

situation in l8l5 within the Big Bend region of the Red River north of
Sulphur Fork:

But the land itself was entirely devoid of white
inhabitants and few if any Indians resided in the area.
The Caddos, who since the time when the memory of man
ran not to the contrary had.lived along the banks of
Red River above the Great Raft, had deserted their
ancient habitat two decades before to escape the vengeance
of their inveterate enemies, the Osages, who (in 1795) had
massacred the greater part of the inhabitants of the villages
on Long Prairie. Consequently with the removal of their
customers the French traders from Natchitoches ceased to
visit the land for the purpose of barter. Thus the fertile
valley of the Red was left open for the coming of the American
frontiersmen bent upon finding suitable hunting and trapping
grounds and farm lands._l§/

Oklahoma, were the aborigina owners of a specific tract of land within
Royce Cession 202g The area awarded to the plaintiff tribe is situated
east of the Red River in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, and extends as far nerth
as the Sulphur River in Arkansaso A more accurate description is set out
in the Commission's Finding l2 as amended by the Commission's order of
January 2, 1957. For the sake of convenience we shall have occasion in
the course of this opinion to refer to the area in question as either the
subject lands, Caddo lands, or Caddo tract as the case may be.

The issue to be resolved at this state is the acreage and the fair
market value of the Caddo lands as of the effective date of the 1835
Caddo Treaty} ‘we find this date to be January 26, 1836, the day Congress
ratified.the treaty provisions. ‘we shall then determine whether the
$80,000 paid for the Caddo lands under the terms of the 1835 treaty is in

fact-an unconscionable consideration within the meaning of the Indian
Claims Commission.act;

Both sides have introduced evidence as to value and have briefed the
question. Hevertheless, they are poles apart on their ultimate evaluations
of the entire tract. The plaintiffs contend that as of l83S the subject lands
had an estimated fair-market value of $l;h76,3S”.OO while the defendant argues
that $2C73550.OO is a more accurate fi are. In like manner both sides
disagree as to the total acreage involved, althoueh their differences are

relatively'slight.

8 II-ldo Clo CD310 

The Caddo tract is a sizeahle pieae of land of a little in excess of
six hundred thousand acres. The Commission finds that the defendant's
acreage computations, which are derived from the township surveys in
Caddo Parish, Louisiana. and in Miller County, Arkansas, are the more
accurate. The Commission therefore finds that the Caddo tract contains
636,321 acres of both land and watered areas. From this gross average
it is necessary to subtract the two tracts reserved under the l83S treaty
for the benefit of Francois Grappe and Larhin Edwards, amounting to
l3,353o5 (Fdg. 16). This leaves a net acreage of 6l?,96?.h to be valued
as of the effective date of the 1835 Caddo treaty.

For the most part the evidence shows a general topographical continuity'spread out over the entire tract. Many'lakes, bayous, rivers,
and streams lace the area, and all eventually find their way to°the Red
River. This latter river is a meandering and slow moving body of water
that flows in a general north and south direction, and forms the eastern”
boundary of the Caddo tract. It affords the prineipal means of drainage
and.the main artery of water travel in this region. The average elevation
above sea level'within Caddo Parish is l80,feet, while in that part of

.33

E§JJ£u'County3 south of the Sulphur River, the elevation varies between
200 and 370 feet.

Within the Caddo tract the uplands are gently rel ing and are
separated from.the bottom.lands and lake regi3n.by a lou bluff line.
Although the early settlers preferred the'uplands due to the better
timber and water facilities, the more fertile acreage proved to be in

the lowlands where the rich topsoil had been aashed down from above. The

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 35% 383

gal

upland soil is mostly of a sandy alluvial deposit.

Climatieally this entire area experiences cool winters and relatively
warm summers with the growing season averaging about 25h days. The first
killing frost may begin around the second week in November, and could
be felt as late as the first week in March. Annual rainfall averages
just over b5 inches, but is heavy enough at times to cause periodic in»
undation in the bottom sections particularly when the Red River and its
tributaries would overflow. There was no levee protection for the low:
lands within the Caddo tract until many years after the 18 35 treaty.

Because of the numerous bayous, lakes, and.small streams, water
travel predominated. Overland trails were few and far between, and the
location of Indian village sites on river banks and lake shores demonstrates
the Indian's reliance on the canoe as the principal means of transportation.

= In the years just prior to the Caddo cession the Red River was largely
obstructed by the :Great Raft," a rare phenomena which gres into one of the
largest natural log jams to be found in any river; Navigation to the upper
regions of the Red River was accomplished by circumventing the Raft through
the connecting bayous, streams and lakes. Besides being a navigational
obstruction the Raft impaired drainage throughout the entire area. Heavyrainfall caused a backing up and diverting of huge quantities of water into
the tributaries and connecting waters of the Red River. Periodic‘flooding
of the lowlands was the result of the river being unable to move off the

water in any sizeable volume. Its fragile banks would then give way causing

more timber to fall into the slow moving water, and tnus the raft continued

to grow as log was piled up against log.

In l833 the legendary Henry Eiller Shreve, who was one of the
founders of Shreveport, undertook the task of removing the Great RaftAt that time the foot of the raft was located near the mouth of Leggy
Bayou which is about 80 miles below the future site of Shreveport. In
his first year Shreve cleared 71 miles of the river ending up just

to remove the remaining 70 miles. Despite his magnificent effort in
clearing the Red River, its success was only temporary and soon thereafter the Raft began to reaforr. It was not until l8?8 that the U; S.
Army'Engineers finally'arrested the causes of its regrowth and left

open the Red River free of obstruction.

Henry Shreve nevertheless envisioned the possibilities that layin developing the rich alluvial lands that would be reclaimed upon final

removal of the Great Raft. The city of ShreVeport'was to be no accident

-out a carefully planned city situated on one of the choicest spots along

the entire river. In l83h, he wrote to the Commissioner of Indian

Affairs that this land, when finally reclaimed; would contain about
seventy thousand acres and sell for an average price of near $h.00 per
acre.
In 1837 Shreveport was founded by the Shrevetoun Company; and

apart from rapid sale of towneites and neighboring property, there was

no unusual demand for other lands within the Caddc tract during the early
post treaty'years.

The Caddo parish township surveys were completed

during the late l830‘s. That portion situated in.Rill

side of the Red River had been surveyed and open fer settlement scveral
years before the Caddo cession. The former Quapaw lands in particular
had been surveyed as early as 1818 and the job completed by 1823a

Population figures for Caddo parish were first recorded in the
18h0 U. S. Census report, Jhich is three years after the founding of
Shreveport. at that time the total white population stood at 2,hlh
while the slave population was 2,837. The total population of the‘
whole state of Louisiana in l8h0 was 352,000.

At the time of the Caddo cession, the Arkansas Territory was
sparsely settled. The total population in 1820 was barely over lh,00O.
In 1830 it reached 30,000, and the l8h0 census figures show a total
population of 97,S7h.

Since mineral development was unknown at the time of the Caddo
cession, timber must be regarded as the prime natural resource in the
area. There was pine timber in the uplands and hardwoods along the
bayous and lakes. In the swamp areas there could be found cypress,
cottonwoods, and willows. Timber, however, was not a merehantable or
commercial item.in the early post treaty years, it being economically
inaccessible. Transportation was the chief problem. The great Raft
had practically closed the Red River above Shreveport. There were no
railroads nor immediate prospects of any'being built. Overland trails
were few and far between. The value of timber thus depended for the
most part on the individual requirements of the homesteader. If needed
for fencing or construction it was a blessing, but if fields had to be
cleared for planting it was a burden. The Commission therefore views

the value of the standing timber on the Caddo tract as dependent on

Corn, maize and pumpkins were the Indian staples. dhite squatters

2 with the lands being worked principally by negro tenant farmers. At

that time approximately'two thirds of Caddo parish was still uncleared
land.
Considering all factors, he topographieal, soil, and climatic
conditions, the transportation problems both by water and overland and
the inadequate means of flood control, the Commission is of the opinion
that as of the date 1835, the highest and best use which could be made
of the Caddo lands by'a hypothetical purchaser was for agricultural
purposes incident to subsistenee homesteading.

In placing an 1835 dollars and cents value on the Caddo lands the
plaintiffs have introduced several exhibits eonsisting of abstracts of

purported comparable sales of land within Caddo parish, Louisiana, and

 

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 3,;

Miller County, Arkansas. These exhibits, which are somewhat duplicative,
represent some hOO selected transactions in Caddo parish from about 1836
to 1850, and some 200 selected private transactions within Miller County,
Arkansas, covering the period 1835 to 1862. There are also some 60
transactions from 1835 to l€hO in neighboring Lafayette County, Arkansas,
and another exnibit listing over 300 public land sales in Caddo parish
for the ten year period l83S—l8hS. All of these principal exhibits have
been discussed in detail in our findings. Needless to say the private
transactions as listed are a mixture of dissimilar transactions involving
sales of improved and unimproved property, town sites, sheriff sales,
sales which also include personalty such as slaves, cattle, farm equipment, crops, etc., and sales of preemption rights, options and mortgages.
All of them in some way figure into the plaintiffs‘ various computations,
calculations, averages, and median figures designed to support such
alleged average per acre prices for the periods involved of $h.SO; $6.83;
$7.lh in Caddo parish, and such figures as $5.h93 $7.31; $10.58; in
TMiller County as well as the ultimate proposed finding that the 1835
fair market value of the Caddo tract was $2.50 per acre.

Plaintiffs also called two wiunesses before the Commission on the

question of value, Dr. Garnie'Uilliam.HcGinty, an historian and teacher,

and Mr. J. W. Trygg, a forer employee of the United States Forest Service.~

Dr. HcGinty testified at length to the history and development of
Caddo parish and the city of Shreveport. However, the Commission concluded that Dr. MeGinty was not qualified to give an expert opinion on

the fair market value of the Caddo tract. Besides his testimony'Dr.

8  Cl: Com.  I 

MeGinty submitted a e ittcn v*Tr=ticn s£ ' which contained a great deal
of historical data, but his e:n:lusions on value as co tained therein
were also dis ialified under the same ruling which applied to his testimony.
Dr. McGinty‘S principal method of developing a fair market price for
the Caddo tract was founded upon what he termed “a value in use.” As he
states in his report it operates in the following manner:
By combining the yield of cot on per acre and the
average market price of cotton per pound, we are able
to develop a value per acre fer the entire potential
cotton crop and from this as a soarting point we are able
to develop a fair market price or value per acre for the
land in quesoion. (Pl. Ex. 195, p. T}.
This theory in substance has been befcre the Commission on prior

occasions and has been found wanting as a judicially unacceptable standard

of evaluation. The Dnwamish Tribe of Indians v. The United States, Z{Ind.

Eta TTygg.on the other hand fared'better than Dr. HcGinty. He

testified that the Caddo tract could be best utilized for agricultural
purposes and that in his opinion it had an 1835 fair market value of $2.50
per acre. The Commission, however, excluded from the record the computations
upon which Mr. Trygg rested his appraisal figure. This, of course, greatly
‘weakens the value of his opinions The Commissien thought that Mr. Trygg's
calculations fell toe far into the realm of speculation and conjecture,

and could not be supported by the  in 4.22.3 '-=:co:‘d.   Some of his

I.-J

deductions were patently arbitrary and represented sclel* the personal

observations of the witness. Er. lrygg also relied heavilv upon tnose

8   COTS. 

exhibits previously mentioned which contain the abstracts of the ;and
transactions in Caddo Parish and hillor County.

Defendant called Mr. J. Burrows Johnson, a qualified appraiser
from New Orleans, as its CL-Eff witness on the value of the Caddo tract.
Mr. Johnson also submitted a detailed written report. Mr. Johnson
adopted a market data approach and utilized comparable land sales of
6h0 acres or more within the vicinity of the Caddo tract for the years
1833 through 1837. Only five of the sales listed during this period are
located within the Caddo lands. According to Mr. Johnson, 71 per cent
of the sales involving 6h0 acres or more retailcd at $1.00 per acre or
less. As of the date of valuation he could find no permanent improvements
on the land nor would he give it any'va1ue as income producing property.
Mr. Johnson was of the opinion that the highest and best use of the land
would'be for colonization purposes and that the hypothetical purchaser
could expect to dispose of the entire tract within twenty'years.

Besides considering the entire tract as a single sale, Mr. Johnson
listed many factors such as accessibility; population, demand for lands,
etc., which he took into consideration in making his-evaluation. He then
broke down the areas into three categories and valued each as follows:
those lands not subject to overflow, $0.h0 per acre; those lands subject
to overflow, $0.10 per acre; and finally‘watered areas, $0.05 per acre.

It seems to the Commission that his Johnson's valuation figures are
on the conservative side. Certainly the impending ramoral of the
Great Raft within the not too distant future wenld generate a more

energetic use of the Red River and thus bring more potential settlers

schaser of the subject lands.

adjacent areas. This is borne out by the large’ namber of recorded
sales under 6hO acres within tte Caddo lands, which sales of course do

not figure in Mr. Johnson's calcelationso ‘Mr. Johnson’s conservatism
may also be the result of his admiutedl; successful experiences as a
prudent land investor when he assumes the role of a hypothetical purMfb Jchnssn did advise the Commission
that in order to arrive at some estimate of the vglne of the Caddo

sBased.upon the findings of fact made herein and the record as a
:hole and after carefully considering such factors as the size of the
Caddo tract, its losation, its topagraphieal features, its accessibility
and those comparable sales within a reasonable time of the effective
date of the treaty; the Cemnission concludes that as of]January 26, 1836,
the Caddo lands, comprising 6l7,967oh acres, had a fair'market value of
$h53,h75.55, or at an average rate of $0.75 per acre.

Finally, the Commission has found that under=AIticle 3 of the 1835
Caddo Treaty; the Caddos reeeived $80,009 in goods and money for all
