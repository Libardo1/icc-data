OPINION Q§_THE COMMISSION

Holt. Associate Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.

By order of the Commission these two cases, one brought by the Prairie
Band of the Pottawatomie Tribe under Docket l5«B. and the other by the
Citizen Band of the Potawatomi Tribe under Docket 111, were consolidated
and tried together. The claims asserted by both claimant groups were for
and on behalf of the Pottawatomie Tribe, and since the two Bands now
compose the membership of said tribe, all the claims asserted in the two
cases were grouped in the opinion into six claims for the purpose of
decision.

On April 23, 195%, the Commission entered an interlocutory order
in the consolidated cases in which it concluded as a matter of law that
the Pottawatomie Tribe of Indians is entitled to recover the following
sums: $338,795.22 on the 1st claim; $5,363.95 on the 3rd claim with

interest thereon from July 1. 1862 to November 9, 1931; at 5% and 1456

thereafter; $819.16 on the hth claim, and $1013.54 on the 6th claim,

3 9+8

3 539

subject, however, to any offsets subsequently found deductible under
Section 2 of the Indian Claims Commission Act, 60 Stat. lOU9.

The defendant filed the same amendment to answer in both cases,
presenting a total of $U2,959.65 in items for offset; however, the
defendant in its requested findings has eliminated certain items,
thereby reducing the amount claimed to $Hl,98l.lO. In order to conform
to the General Accounting Office Report (Def. Ex. 96) showing the
separate charges against the Prairie Band and the Citizen Band.
respectively, these Claimed offsets are separated in the amended answers
into six groups of expenditures, which are separately set forth in
paragraphs 56 through 61. The items listed in paragraphs 56 and 57
are shown as Expenditures made exclusively for the benefit of the
Prairie Band and the Citizen Band, respectively, while those listed
in paragraph 58 are shown as having been made for the Prairie Band
jointly with other Indian tribes in Kansas. Paragraphs 59, 60 and
61 each list expenditures claimed to have been made for the benefit
of the Citizen Band jointly with other Indian tribes during three
periods of time said Band was under the jurisdiction of three different
agencies in Oklahoma. As stated, defendant has eliminated some items
entirely and reduced amounts claimed for others, so these six groups,
as revised by defendant, will be considered in the order set forth in
the Commission‘s Finding N0. N0.

Since the claimed offsets are all gratuitous expenditures, the
allowance of such offsets is governed by the following provision of

Section 2 of the Indian Claims Commission Act:

3 550

° “.‘ the Commission may also inquire into and consider

all money or property given to or funds expended gratuitously
for the benefit of the claimant and if it finds that the
nature of the claim and the entire course of dealings and
accounts between the United States and the claimant in good
conscience warrants such action, may set off all or part of
such expenditures against any award made to the claimant,
except that it is hereby declared to be the policy of
Congress that monies spent for the removal of the claimant
from one place to another at the request of the United
States, or for agency or other administrative, educational,
health or highway purposes, or for expenditures made prior
to the date of the law, treaty or Executive Order under which
the claim arose, or for expenditures made pursuant to the
Act of June 18, 193M (#8 Stat. 98M), save expenditures made
under section 5 of that Act, or for expenditures under any
emergency appropriation or allotment made subsequent to
March H, 1933. and generally applicable throughout the
United States for relief in stricken agricultural areas,
relief from distress caused by unemployment and conditions
resulting therefrom, the prosecution of public work and
public projects for the relief of unemployment or to
increase employment, and for work relief (including the

Civil Works Program) shall not be a proper offset against
any award.

L

It seems quite clear from the language of the Act that, except

as to those gratuitous expenditures expressly excluded, the Commission

is permitted to exercise a large degree of discretion in the allowance

of gratuities as offsets.

The classification of expenditures and amounts are set out

separately within the six groups of claimed offsets, and by stipulation

of the parties approved by the Commission, counsel for defendant submitted
in evidence one typical voucher for each classification, and the remaining vouchers were received in evidence by reference.

I. OFFSETS AGAINST PRAIRIE BAND OF 100% «
August 7, 18 8 to June 30, 1951
Agricultural Aid: Seed, Fruit Trees and Fertilizer. $355.48

From appropriations of public funds for the “Support and Rehabilitation of Needy Indians" the defendant spent $142.73 in 1933; $31.25

in 19141;; $130.00 in 19145 and $51.50 in 19%. or a total cf $355.1+s, for
the purchase of seed, fruit trees and fertilizer delivered to individual named indigent members of the Prairie Band under the jurisdiction
of the Kansas Potawatomi Agency. These expenditures are represented
by 20 separate vouchers, of which the typical voucher in evidence (Def.
Ex. A) shows a payment of $6.50 for 10 bushels of seed oats "for indigent Indian, Joe Nott.” We think that 20 separate purchases of seed
over a four year period for individual indigent Indians, out of a

total tribal membership of over 700, shows these expenditures were made
for the use and benefit of individuals rather than for the tribe as a
whole. Such expenditure does not constitute a proper offset and it is

denied the defendant.

Agricultural Inoleaents, $300.00.

...-.—..-—_uC—.....-—..-.—-....._..

     

....- ..__-u.—__._.-..—_...y-—.¢In 1871, farming implements consisting of plows, sod breakers,
harness, wagons, hoes, hammers and other similar items costing $860.77
were purchased for use by the Prairie Band. Of this sum, $560.77 was
paid from funds belonging to the Prairie Band and the other $300.00 was
expended by the defendant from an appropriation for the "Civilization of
Indians in Central Superintendency." We have examined this Act, 16 Stat.
335, 358, and it recites that the purpose of the appropriation was “to
carry on the work of instructing and aiding the Indians of the Central
Superintendency in the arts of civilization with a view to their selfsupport." The evidence indicates that in l87l the defendant made the
expenditure for that purpose, and certainly the agricultural implements
purchased were suitable for such purpose.

In the case of Menominee Tribe of Indians V. The United States,

355

118 C. Cls. 290, the Court of Claims held that in the absence of any
showing as to Just what was the purpose of expenditures for agricultural
implements. they were for the purpose of demonstration, and were
educational,_therefore not proper offsets under the Indian Claims
Commission Act. We believe the evidence shows the $300.00 expended

by the defendant for agricultural implements was for educationalp
purposes within the meaning of the Indian Claims Commission not as
interpreted in the Menominee case and is not a proper offset. This
expenditure of $300.00 may not be set-off.

Clothing for Indigent Indians, $M98.75.

 

This item of $h98.75 is for expenditurhs made by defendant between

the years 1931 to l9M5, inclusive, for the purchase of clothing for
the Prairie Band. These expenditures are represented by 29 separate
vouchers. and the voucher in evidence (Def. Ex. ”C") is for $10.00 paid
for clothes and dress goods purchased for "Nora 03Binnick, an indigent
Indian" from the appropriation for "Support &.Rehab., of Needy Indians
l9N2.“ The General Accounting Office report shows that during the 7
years between 1931 and l9U0, inclusive. a total of $Hl3.76 was expended
under the appropriation: "Support of Indians and Administration of
Indian Property" and from 19u2 to 19h5 a total of $8h.99 was expended
under the appropriation: "Support and Rehabilitation of Needy Indians."
We also note that the only year in which expenditures were in such an
amount as to indicate tribal as distinguished from individual benefits
is 1931 when $308.H5 was expanded, leaving only $190.60 expended over

the other ten years. We think the amount of $3o8.u5 in 1931 should be

allowed as a proper offset. but that the items totaling $190.60 appear

to constitute individual benefits and_should be disallowed.

Expenses of Indian Delegations, $332.25.

frhis total amount of $332.25 consists of four separate items of

expenditures. each made under a different appropriation act. The first

item was e@ended in 1859 under "Provisions for Indians‘; the next item
was amended in 1873 under-"Contingencies, Indian Department“; the

thirditem in 1880 paid from the “Civilization Fp.nd"_. and the last it_e_m

in 19140 under the appropriation for "Support of Indians and Administration
of Indian Property.” aich items of emenditure apparently do not come

within any of the ezgzceptions enumerated in Section 2 of the Indian
Claims Commission Act, and we believe constitute expenditures made for

the benefit of the Prairie’ Band which. in good‘conscience,\ should be

charged against said Band. _ We also have the precedent--of the case

of the Quapaw Tribe of Indians 17. The United States. 123 c. Cls. 1+5,
allowing such type of expenditures for o:E’i‘set purposes. We find the

amount of $332.25 should be allowed.

Funeral Expenses for Indigent Prairie Band Indians. $930.22.
In 1915, the sum of $55.00 was expended under an appropriation
for the Indian Service entitled “Believing Distress, and Prevention,

etc... of Diseases among Indians" for funeral expenses for a member

of the Prairie Band. Between 1930 and 1937, inclusive, aetetad oi‘

$515.29 was expended 1’ or funeral expenses of indigent Prairie Band

Indians under an appgriatnonfcir "Support of Indians and Administration
of Indian Property.” Also during 1932 and 19)-I-3, the total sum of

$360.00 was paid for that purpose under the appropriation for the

“Support and Rehabilitation of Needy Indians.". It appears to have been

gratuitous expenditure, and such payments have been consistently

considered to be a tribal benefit.‘ In both the Menominee case and

thaquapaw case. supra. the Court of Claims recogized funeral BXPEBSBS
as constituting a tribal benefit, _”not_-_within the exceptions enumerated

in the Indian Claims Commission Act, and allowed such payments as

. proper offsets. We think the Prairie Band should be charged with the

sum of $930.29 as an offset against its share of the award herein.

Livestock:

Feed and care of $58.95
Purchase of $3 .00 5 

The charge of $58.95 for the purchase of feed and care of livestock

between 1911-2 and 1946, inclusive, is supported by three vouchers. .

The sample voucher in evidence shows the purchase of egg mash pellets

in

and hog nuggets for a total price of $13.96 for "indigent Indian,
Pete Mzhickteno.“ The charge of $39.00 for the purchase of -livestock
during the same period is supported by two vouchers, the sample voucher

in evidence covering the purchase of 100 baby chicks at $14.00 per

hundred for “indigent Indian, Ernest Levier.” All emenditures are

charged to the appropriation for the "Support and Rehabilitation of
Reedy Indians.“ :5

But few Indians couldhave benefited by these expenditures during

these five years, and we believe they must be classified as individual

rather than tribal benefits and, accordingly, are not. allowed as offsets.

Miscellaneous Building Materials for Prairie Band Indians, $7488.13.

1,915 for "Supp_ort and Rehabilitation of neeeor Indians“ in payment for
building ;materials used in building root cellars for indigent Prairie

_ Band Indians. In theiquapaw case the Court of Claims denied as an
offset a single expenditure for building materials, but on the ground
it was made under an act providingfor the education and civilization
of the Indians including lodging for children attending school, and‘

therefore made for agency or educational purposes barred-by the Indian

Cl_a:Lms Comnissionggct. Here, these egenditures do not appear to be

barred by the Indian Claims Commissionenct, and were made for a
substantial number of Prairie Band Indian families, so would seem to
constitute a tribal benefit. We believe these expenditures are proper

offsets and they are therefore allowed against the Prairie Band.

Provisions , $5720.90.

The General Accounting Office Report (p. 128) recites that $16.00
of the above amount was spent in l8'{l under a provision for "Contingencies,
Indian Department.“ The sum of $181.03 is reported (p. 1143) as being
spent during 19215 1925 and 1926 underpthe provisions in the applicable
appropriation Acts_i'or “Relieving Distress.and.oPrevention, etc. of
Diseases among Indians.“ The total sum of $1595.09 is shown (PP- 1146 to
150, inclusive) to have been disbursed in 1930 through 191:1 under the
provision of appropriation acts for those years for the “Support of
Indians and Administration of Indian Property.” In 1912' through 1916
the sun of $882.78 is shown (pp. 1131}, 1}-I-'5) to have been paid under the
provisions of the Acts for those years for the "Support and Rehabilitation of Heed-y Indians.“ In 19132, $36.00 was expended (p. ll?) under

the provision for “Administration of_ Indian Property,” and in 19348 the

expenditures totaling $3,720.90 are represented by 1400 vouchers. We
have examined these vouchers and note that they all represent payment
for ;groceries purchased in small amounts by named individual indigent
Indians. each having been identified byofficials of the General
Accounting Office as a member of the Prairie Band. ‘It is also noted
that many of the vouchers covering the 21+ year period show multiple

purchases by the same individual Indians. indicating-thatpa very limited

numb er of members received such benefits. Ordinarily, provisions

supplied gratuitously by the defendant for general distribution within
the tribe, wouldbe a proper item for offset against the tribe, but

where the evidence definitely shows, as it does here, that the expenditures were in payment of small purchases made by named indigent lndians. ,

L

we think such payments constitute individual as distinguished from
tribal benefits and should not be allowed as offsets against the

Prairie Band. We, therefor_e,deny_ this item as an offset.

Surveying and Allotting Prairie Band Lands of Kansas Reservation,

 

$1,101.85.

This sum of ‘$1,101.85 is made up of expenditures by the defendant
in 1899 of $102.60 and in 1905 of $999.25, both of which were paid from
appropriations for “Surveying and Allotting Indian Reservations." These
expenditures were made in connection with the survey. allotment and 1
sale of surplus or unallotted Prairie Band reservation lands in Kansas.

the members of the Bend, the surplus lands were to be sold. in appropriation wasmade in each of said Acts for use in carrying the Acts

into effect and providing that the United. States be reimbursed out of
the proceeds of the sale of said lands. the Act of March 3, 1903, 32

$tat. 982, 1007, amended the 1899 Act by providing that before the

' surplus land was sold, allotments be made to eachabsentee member and

to children born since prior allotments had been made.

Ehere does not appear to have been any obligation on the part of

the United States to pay the expenses incident to surveying, allotting

and selling the reservation lands for the Prairie Band, and it seems

plain from the provisions of the acts referred to above that the

Prairie Band was to bear such expenses. is such.payments'were gratuities _

that benefited the Prairie Band, we are therefore of the opinion the

$1,101.85 paid by the defendant is a proper offset and accordingly is
allowed.

, In the Menominee case, supra, expenditures for seeds, fruit trees
and fertilizer were disallowed as offsets by the Court of Claims on the
ground that they were for the purpose of demonstration and were edu-_»
cational, in the absence of any showing to the contrary. The report of
the General Accounting Office in the present case, hovreyer, shows that
from 1938 through 1912 the defendant spent the sum of $672.75 under the
provision in the appropriation Acts forthose years for the "Support
and Administration of Indian Property” in payment for seed furnished to
all the Indians at the Potawatomi Agency, and from 19122 through 19345 the

defendant also spent the sum of $l,O61t.75 for the same purpose under

provision in the appropriation acts for those years for the “Support and

Rehabilitation of Needy Indians.“ We find nothing in these provisions
that would indicate the fundsjwere to be used for educational purposes

within the meaning of the Indian Claims Commission Act as interpreted in

the Menomnee case. We think there is a distinction between the furnishing

of seed for experimental or demonstration purposes, and the distribution

of seed among the Indians for the purpose _'of producing food contributing

’ to their livelihood. These funds appear to have been expended for the

latter purpose, and we think they are proper offsets. Since the Prairie__

Band averaged 53 .1 percent of the Indian population under the Potawatomi

, Agency, its proportionate share of the $1,737.50 expended for seed, is

$922.61. which sum is allowed as a proper offset against the Prairie Band.

Under the provision in the Appropriation Act for “welfare of Indians '

second item is for $110.00 expended in 1922 in payment of fees and expenses ofua surveyor in surveying land described__a.s Lot 3 in "Section 36,

This appears to be an administrative expense, as such duty of approving

$570.15 under the provision in the appropriation acts for those years
for_"Snpport ‘of Indians and Administration of Indian Property? to purchase groceries for individually named indigent Indians. During the

years 1932 and 19343 the defendant also expended $33.75 for the same purPose from a fund provided for the -."Snpport and Rehabilitation of Needy
Indians.” It appears from the evidence that each of the Indians receiving snch reliefhas been identified as a menberof the Citizen Band.
However, we think the expenditure of $603.90 for such purposes over a

period of eleven years, or an average of $345.00 a year for a membership L
of over 2,000, certainly indicates individual rather than tribal benefits

were being met. We deny this item as an offset.

furnished for the use and’ benefit of all the Indians under the Sac and

Participated in the distribution of the flour, it is reasonable to assume
they benefited by such expenditures in direct ratio to their percentage
of the total Indian population under that agency. Since it_has been
fairly shown that at that time the Citizen Band membership composed about
29.9 per cent of such total population, the defendant is entitled, on the

the appropriation for the ‘Support of Indians and Administration of
Indian Property, 1938" in purchasing garden seed for the use of all the
Indians at the Shawnee Agency in Oklahoma. We have hereinbef ore allowed
as a. proper offset against the Prairie Band such expenditures made for

the situation with respect to this expenditure for the benefit of the

Citizen Band is the same. We find this item to be a proper offset.

Board of Public Welfarewfor handling and service charges. he remaining
11% vouchers show payment principally for Irish potatoes delivered to

the Indian Office at Anadarko, Oklahoma.
The proof does not show, except for the possible cash payments of

$502.57, what portion of the aggregate amount was actually expended for

the benefit of the Citizen Band. It appears there is no record showing

the total Indian population under the large Consolidated. Agency during
the years 19!-18 through 1951 when the expenditures were made. In fact,
the last official estimate was reported in 1915, estimating the total
jpopeletiee at-,_19,21+s of which 2,971; were Citizen Band Pottawatomie
Indians, andit. is on this estimate of 19145 that dei'endant‘seeks to

offset 1.5.5 per cent of the total amount expendedfor the benefit of all
the Indians.u‘nder the'_Consolid.ated Agencies during the years E19148 through
1951. The advanced state of civilization of the members of the Citizen
Band has long been recoaized, and it is highly improbable that the
members required any great amount of relief aid at this late date. This
is evident from the few members actually shown to have received cash
payments. Under these circumstances, and particularly since most, if
not ell,_of these sums were payments. to or for named individual indigent Indians, it is obviously unconscionable to charge such individual
benefits against the Citizen Band as a tribal benefit. We do not believe that such expenditures constitute proper offsets against the

Citizen Band, and accordingly they are disallowed.

To summarize, the offsets allowed are as follows:
