PER CURIAH. The éefcndent, on October 25, 1950, fileé its motion
for an crder to require plaintiff to sepecetely state and n*mber its
several causes of action.

The petition consists of ten consecutively nuncered paragraphs,
As we read the petition, there are two, and nerheps three, separate
ehd distinct occurrences, nsmely:

(1) A cause of action brsed mean the gross iaaéecuecc of the

coneiéeretion peie by the ésfencant for the cession of the 309 square

KD

-2miles of territory relinquished by the treaty of January 28. 1655.

12 Stat. 939. The allegations which would seen to apply to this

cause of action are those contained in paragraphs numbered III. IV

and VI (5 paragraph numbered V does not appear in the petition).

It cannot be seriously contended that the claim based upon unconscionable consideration is not a separate “transaction or occurrence,“
in fact. counsel for plaintiff, in their brief, do not really question
the propriety of making the allegations respecting unconscionable consideration the subject of a separate count. Re are of the opinion that
that claim is one which should be set forth in a separate count and
the paragraphs thereof numbered, as required by section 9(b) of our
rules.

Concerning the allegations relating to unconscionable consideration, we find the naked statenent that "the consideration therefor
(the treaty) was unconscionable." There is no allegation as to the value
of the cession when made, nor are there any facts stated upon which we
can determine value. It is necessary to know the value of the cession
in order to determine whether the alleged consideration was unconscionable. A mere statement that an alleged consideration is unconscionable is little nore than a conclusion of the pleader. The value
of the cession should be stated in the pleading.

(2)  allegations in n3.ra{-;I'::_o11s VII, VIII and :.~;, and perhaos
allegations in other parts of the petition, charge the violation of provisions of the 1355 treaty by destroying the Indians rights of sealing,

"gm
halibut ené salmon fishing secereé them by said treat”. The breaches
so a11egee.&o not constitute separate causes of sctien but are several
breaches of the same treaty end may be inclueed in e single count
and numberea as required by said section 9(b)o

In paragraph VII the plaintiff pleads that the defendant by intern
national agreements and the enactment of laws pursuant thereto have
ebrogetee the rights of the Indians to eke seal. Surely the plaintiff knows what the egreements ens less are upon which the allegations
are based. Es see n3 reason why the agreements ane laws re1ied.upon
should not be aefinitely isentified ene the pestinent parts thereof
pleaded.

Likewise, the pleiati
agreements restricting and limiting helibut fissine ene ,lead the sertinent earts of such agreements re1ied.upen. And as to paragraph IX
