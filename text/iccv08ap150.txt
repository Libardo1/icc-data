The Commission makes the following findings of fact which are
supplemental to findings numbered 1 to 30, inclusive, heretofore made
in these consolidated dockets (2 Ind. Cl. Comm. 536; 3 Ind. Cl. COuuc
 622). *

31. It has earlier been determined that these consolidated dockets

are to be treated as though the petitioners were joined in one petition;
that the petitioners acquired title to the tract known as the Delaware

Outlet under the Treaty of September 2b,
782); that said tract was lO miles wide by ISO miles
960,000 acres (3 Ind. 01. com. 622

acquired petitioners‘ interest in said land under the Delaware Treaty of
May 6, 185b, IO Stat. lOh8 (2 Ind. Cl. Comm, 536), The issue presently
before us is the market value of said land on Kay 6, 185k.

32, The De_auare Outlet is identified upon Royco's Rap 2 of Kansas,

Vol. 18, B.AtE., as Area 316, The actual Outlet, however, does not extend

pas far west as there shown, It lies parallel to and 30 miles south of the

Kansas—Nebraska boundary, and encloses the northern IO miles of all of

Pottawatomie, Riley, Clay, Cloud andlhitchell counties, the west twowthirds

of Jackson and the northeast edge of Osborne counties. Its eastern boundary
.'1

is a north and south line running about § mile east of the center of Range 15

East, from a point about 35 miles west of Atchison, Kansas, southward to a

_point approximately 2 miles west and 25 miles north of Topeka, Kansas. Its

western terminus is a north and south line about 3 miles west of the fork
of Solomon river and %-mile east of the center of Range 11 west in Osborne
county. All of Township 6 South and the northern twowthirds of Township 7
South in Ranges 1 to lh East and l to lO‘West, and parts of Townships 6 and
7 South in Ranges 15 East and 11 West, are within its borders.

Along the southern borderrthe Outlet adjoins the former Haw or Kansas
Indian reservation land which the government acquired in l8h6. The eastern
35 miles borders upon the Kansas land granted the Pottanatomie Indians in
l8h6 and reacquired by the government latero

(a) _The tract is intersected.by the Vermillion, the Big Blue, the
Republican and the Solomon rivers and their branches, all flowing generally

southeast into the Kansas river. The Missouri river about 35 miles east of

\o

the Outlet, is narigable and open for around eight montls of the year. The

Kansas river, which flows from 15 to 26 miles sooth of and alon

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 150 152

Outlet, is navigable for steamboats of light draft during high water periods
as far as Fort Files.
33. Approximately half of the Outlet lies in three subdivisions of the
Soil Conservation Scrrice, Department of Agriculture's classification of
"Central Kansas Rolling Plains." (a) Along the western terminus and in a
small tract south of the Solomon river there are approximately 32,06h acres
of Shale-Limestone. The surface is gently rolling, with bedrock outcroppinés
in the steep slopes along the streams. Most of the soils are moderately heavy
with considerable runoff, even on the smoother slopes. Conservation is necessary, and ground water is quite limited. t(b) Immediately north and east
are approximately 229,920 acres in the Kansas«Nebraska Loess Plains region.
It consists primarily of broad, smooth divides with rolling land adjacent to
:§narrow valleys draining into the Republican and Solomon rivers. There is a
considerable depth of Loess soil over the bedrock and heavy clay or claytpan
like soils on the smooth divides. It is relatively fertile, slowly permeable
and has a high water storage capacity; .(c) Between this section and the
Republican river eastward is found Shale-Sandstone'which, together with a
finger-Shaped projection extending southward in to north central Clay county
just east of that river. contains approximately'l2?,l20 acres. There are
extensive bodies of rough, broken to hilly land, and most of the streams and

Valleys are deeply'entrenchee. The steep hills are capped by sandstone

93°aPPm€ntS; there are areas of shallow, gr vellv

«.9

or stony soil. Conservation

measures are necessary; erosion is prevalent but greund'water is relativelv

abundant.

Midway of the Outlet and east of the Republiean river is a narrow

8 Ind. Cl. Com. lSG 133

north and south strip of approximately 96,38h acres known as the Central
Kansas Section of the Central Kansas Prairies region, a division of the
Residual Prairies and Interspersed woodlands soil classification. Except
for a few local loess deposits, the soils are limestones and grayish limy

shales. The terrain is smooth to gently rolling with broken areas along

«the streams which are only moderately entrenched. Ground water is limited.

From lO% to lS% of the land is not suitable for cropping, having thin soil
on outcropping limestones, cherty limestone and shale.

Next east, and bisected by the Blue river, are l70,h00 acres of KansasOklahoma Bluestem.or Limestone Flint Hills. The terrain is rolling to hilly,
with steep breaks and escarpments adjacent to the valley streams. The parties
hereto are agreed that this area from.Ranoe ll East through Range 5 East is a
rich limestone grazing area, too rough, broken or rocky for cultivation. It
produces an abundance of bluestem and other tall grasses, making it one of
the best grazing areas in the state even though it has limited ground water.

The eastern.part of the Outlet lies'within.the Kansas-NebraskaIDrif*Loess Hills Section of the Loess~Drift Hills division, and encompasses about
207,6h8 acres. It has narrow, gently sloping divides, with long, moderate
to moderately steep slopes broken by rough, stony land and bedrock outcrops
just above the valleys, which are deeply entrenched and broad. The soil on
the steeper slopes is thin and readily eroded. Cultivation is restricted
to sloping to rolling lands in the valleys and divides. Ground'water is
adequate.

Along the Vermillion, Blue, Republican and Solomon river valleys there

are generally'two terraces. The lower valley of the Republican is send; and

‘~:\'..v'

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 150 lSh

between E and S rilcs wide, that of the Solomon 2 to 3 miles in width and
quite sandy. Both are subject to inundation. The immediate valley of the
Blue is seldom more than a mile wide. Outside these areas the terrain is
nearly all level to gently sloping, the soils moderately friable to friable
silt loams to silty clay loans. Comprising about 9h,h6h acres all together,
these sections are designated River Flood Plains and Lou Terraces.

The western end of the Outlet is about 500 feet higher in elevation
than the eastern portion. It is hot in summer, cold in winter, with average
annual temperatures of 53° to 58°; the average growing season varies from O
165 to 190 days; the average rainfall varies from 2h to 29 inches in the
West to 29 to 35 inches in the east. Principal original vegetation was the
big and little bluestem grass, mixed in the westerly part with drrncht~

a.

resistant short buffalo and gramme grasses, the litter on ridge tops and

L?"

g thin soils, the prairie grass on the bottoms and better soil. The Big Blue
river and Fancy creek bottoms and the extreme eastern end of the Outlet
were well timbered with some hardwoods but cottonwood predominated. ‘Westward

timber was found in diminishing amounts only along the streams. The cottonwood

possessed little value to the settler except as posts. Many townships were

lacking both timber and water.

In 185h neither limestone nor timber possessed a present or potential
commercial value apart from the Outlet land. The best prospective use for
that land was as subsistence farms, except that portion known as the Limestone

3h. The annexation of Texas in l8hS, settlement of the CanadianOregon boundary dispute in 18b6, discovery of gold in California and the
Mexican cession of l8h8 all contributed to a western migration within the
United States. Twith the resultant passage of emigrants westward through

the Indian country, by 1850 a demand had developed for the land west of
Missouri and Iowa to be opened for settlement. The Indian agents also
believed their removal from the emigrant trails and contact with whites

would be beneficial to the Indians there, and on.March 3, 1853 (10 Stat.

226, 238), Congress authorized the extinguishment of Indian title in that
region. The Kansas-Nebraska Territorial bill was introduced during

December, l853, and adopted May 30, l8Sh (lO Stat. 227). Kansas was admitted
to the Union on January 29, 1861 (12 Stat. l26). (Pet. Ex. V~l5, Comp. Ex.

p. b2).

35. By 185k transportation to Kansas from the east was primarily by

way of the Missouri river. sRiver freight from St. Louis arrived at Heston
opposite Fort Leavenworth in from 3% to h days and cost from.$l.OO to $1.50
per hundred weight. The only road within the Outlet was the Oregon Trail
which ran from Kansas City north of the Naruska river, crossed the Kansas
river about 2O miles east of St. Mary's, and then ran north along the east
side of the Blue river, across the Outlet, and on to Nebraska. ,The Leavenworth
Emigrant Road from Fort Leavenworth passed within a few miles of the northeast
corner of the Outlet, merged with the St. Joseph Emigrant Road from St. Joseph,‘
‘Missouri, and joined the Oregon Trail near the Kansasehebraska state line.
South of the Outlet the Santa Fe Trail from Kansas City ran through Council

Grove on the Neosho river and through Walnut Creek on the Arkansas river.

westward along the north side of the Kansas river to Fort Riley, and then
ran south to the Santa Fe Trail, A military road connected Forts Leavenworth

and Scott, running along the eastern edge of Karena Territory. Frei
on these overland routes were from $1.00 to $2.03 per hundred weight per lOO
miles.

The only crossing over the Blue river in Kansas was by ferry, about two
miles above its mouth and some fifteen miles south of tie Outlet. There was
neither bridge nor ferry across the Republican rirer‘which bisects the Outlet
nearly'in half, nor across the Solomon river in its extreme southwestern
corner.

There were no railroads in Kansas in l8Sh, but it was believed that

the Hannibal & St. Josep; Railroad would shortl;'be extended across the’

énississippi to St. Joseph, Missouri, and that the Pacific Railroad between

St. Louis and Jefferson City, Missouri, would soon reach Kansas City, and

along the Santa Fe Trail or the Kansas river. Railroad fare from Boston to

St‘ Louis in 1855 was $29 for first class passeee and $13 for emigrant

C-‘CD-5-I

Classes; from St. Louis to Kansas the fare was $12 for ca~in passage.
Increment to land values resulting from.the presenac of transportation lines
is exhausted within six to fifteen miles. These proposed routes were each

in excess of that mileage from the Outlet.

36. Foremost among those factors to which a prospective purchaser
of frontier land gave consideration were those of accessibility to transportation, the fertility of the soil and the presence of timber and water.
A study of the settlement pattern.of the State of Missouri shows a marked

preference for home sites along a stream with timber and adjacent prairie

. land, and settlement approached Kansas principally by way of the Missouri

river. By'l83O the population density within Missouri opposite the Delaware
trust land, between'Kestport (Kansas City) and Fort Leavenworth, was 18 to

hh persons per square mile. ‘Within the next decade this density extended
slightly north of Fort Leavenworth and by 1850 it reached in a widened band
to a short distance south of Kansas City. St. Louis and vicinity had a
greater density. Some settlement in Kansas also occurred during that dtcade,
even prior to the Kansas-Nebraska Territorial Act.l While it was most heavily

concentrated in northeastern and eastern Kansas, by l8Sh there were a feud

settlers west of the military post, Fort Riley, and along the Santa Fe Trail

near the Arkansas river.

BY'l360 the 18 to hh persons per square mile density extended along
both sides of the Missouri river, running from 25 to hS miles deep into the
state along the Kansas river. Immediately south of that river was a short
belt fr0m.5O to 100 miles wide having a density of 6 to 1? persons per square
mile, but otherwise the state had less than 2 to 5 persons per square mile.
In March, 1855, the population of Kansas, including l92 slaves, was 8,601.
Approximately 700 of them.were military personnel and dependents attached

to Forts Riley and Leavenworth (Def. Ex. 69, p. 15). Practically the entire

civilian population was in extreme eastern Kansas. Uhen admitted to the

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 150 158

%Union on Januar3“29, l86l, 12 Stat. 126, Kansas had a population of 17,206
souls.

By 1870 when the l8 to hh persons per square mile density covered all
but the extreme southern part of Missouri, only the eastern sixty miles of
a strip along U19 {ansas river in Kansas were in that bracket. ‘While heavy
density patterns blanketed Kansas City and Leavenworth and northeast and
southeast Kansas had 6 to 18 persons per square mile, the balance of the
state still rated.from less than 2 to 6 persons per square mile. In December,
l85h, Lawrence, Kansas, on the Kansas river, was the center of settled terriu

tory in Kansas.

38. with the passage of the Kansas;Nebraska Territorial Act, the Public

Sale and Private Entry Act became applicable to public land within those
territories. As amended April 2h, l82O (3 Stat. 566) the Act provided for the
sale of surveyed public land to the highest bidder for cash and fixed a minimum
Of $1.25 per acre upon it. At private sale following the public offering,
entire sections or less could be purchased for $1.25 per acre. The pre-emption
Act of September h, l8hl (5 Stat. h53) was also extended to Kansas Territory on
July 22, l85h (10 Stat. 308}, immediately after the passage of the Territorial

Act. It provided that any person not owning land within the territory; or as

‘ much as 320 acres elsewhere, might enter upon l6O acres of the public land

before survey or so much as would make his holdings 320 acres, register a
claim.within 3 months after its survey, and pay $1.25 per acre for it prior

to its public sale, provided he had made actual settlement, erected a dwelling
of specified dimensions and.was in residence.

(e) Other enactments provided for gralts of land in aid of education,
internal improvements and for railroad construction as well as for the
issuance of military'bounty'warrants and scrip which were applicable for
land purchases. Grants for transportation development usually reserved
alternate sections along the route uhich.were then held for sale at “double

minimum” or $2.50 per acre.

(b) Congressional records reflect that as c.':.r1y as 18130 the slow
gisposition of the public domain was a matter of 1 Congressional concern.
R proposed plan of graduated reduction in price was reported in 181;!” and
Lt was clearly evident prior to May 6, 15511, that some such relief as that
,1-ovided by the Graduation Act would soon be provided. The Graduation Act,
mqnmd August h, 189k (10 Stat. 57h), Provided for a graduated reduction
3 the price fixed upon the public domain from $1.00 per acre for land on
he market 10 years down to 12% cents per acre for land on the market 30
cars or more.
The passage of the Graduation Act reduced the price of 77,561,007

tree of the public domain. On June 30, 1853, unsold and unappropriatcd

ad in Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois and Michigan totaled 66,709, 000 acres, of
ich 12,672,727 acres were subject to reduction under the Act of 1851;. Over
,000,000 acres remained undisposed of in both Iowa and Missouri on June 30,
54, and over 13, 850,000 acres in Missouri and 595,000 acres in Iowa were

In 1858 public land sales were slightly'ab0re the statutoryi
minimum price. The average price per acre during the last half of 1852
was $1.98; in 1853 it was $l.hl; in 1858, $1.30; and in 1855, $l.3h.
Expenses ranged from h cents per acre in l85h to 16 cents per acre in 1852.
These prices in excess of the fixed $1.25 per acre result primarily from
the sale of lllinois land for over $2.00 per acre and Ohio land for over
$3.00 per acre. The cost of surveys of the public land and private land
claims from the beginning of the system to June 30, 1880, is estimated at
3% cents per acre.

The cost of disposition was 2.9 cents per acre, a total

of 6.2 cents per acre for survey and sale.

h2. Settlers going upon the public domain prior to its survey or
public sale were known as "squatters" and their rights were referred to
as "claims." 'While these claims were not legally transferable, they were
sold in great numbers and their transfer was recognized by the Government.
Both speculators and legitimate settlers frequently formed combines or
associations to protect their entries, and control bidding at the public
land sales. By such methods the minimum government price of $1.25 per
acre frequently became the maximum obtainable at public sales. While
Kansas land was held off the.market until 1857, the right to enter the

public domain in that state existed after July 22, 185k.

Economic Data

R3. The country was faced with a slight recession in l85h. ‘While
the general price index rose more than 10% between 185k and 1857, the index
for farm products declined during the same period. Using 1825 as a norm,
the general price index varied from 96.7 in 1851 to 120.5 in 185b, to a high
of 135.5 in 1857 and 115.2 in l860. The index for farm products ran from 5
11u.7 in 1851 ..:.!:.o 1l:,0.8 in 1851;, a high of 1u?.2 in 1855, 139.2 in 1857 and
1.13.5 in 1860.

A purchaser of the Outlet in l85h would have had as his nearest marketing
point Fort Riley'where a military post was established in l853, and St. Joseph,
Fort Leavenworth and Kansas City, all three on the Missouri rirer at least 35

miles distant from the eastern end of the Outlet;

8 Ind. C1. Com. 150 165
ha. A prospective purchaser requiring financing in Kansas about l85h

would have expected to pay around % interest therefor.

 

Evidence: Early day mortgage records in the various Kansas counties

disclose that the rates most commonly charged as interest there in the
l850’S were hgénuigg per month. (Def. "V. 69, p. 21). By Act Of Na?Ch 3,
18b8, 9 Stat. 21?, 20 year federal loans carried 65 interest, lh year
indemnity stock issued in Texas during 1850 carried 5% interest. Short
term notes bore 3 to 6% interest in 1857. Railroad bonds of the State

$1,000 for.machinery; It was possible to buy 100 acres of ground at the
government price for the cost of a mower or reaper, and wheat lands required the heaviest outlay in machinery. Seed wheat cost from $1.00 to
$2.00 per acre; corn $1.50 per bushel. A commonly quoted price for sod

breaking W88 $2.50 per acre, with prices ranging from $1.50 to $5.00. The

Q first summer was usually spent breaking sod, the fall in building and the

winter in fencing. Prairie area houses were of log, board, sod or limestone

and even tents were used. .A log one—room.12 x 15 foot house cost $70 to

build. Cottonwood was unsatisfactory for construction and pine was brought

in from.New York at $100 per thousand board feet» Limestone and Osage Orange
were used for fencing. A fence around a ho-acre field cost at least $320.
Fencing was estimated to increase the value of a farm by'a third. Family’
maintenance for the first year usually cost $100.00. Draft animals were

hS%. A prospective purchaser of the Outlet on Bay 6, l8Sh, would have
been aware of the imminent passage of the Kansaswhebraska Territorial Bill
which had incorporated within it the principle of squatters‘ sovereignty,
setting aside the Eistouri Compromise insofar as slavery within the new
territories was concerned. He would have given consideration to the desires
of the pro and anti-slavery groups to advance their respective policies, but
that both sides would have organized for the purpose of planting early settlements in Kansas and engaged in such an active rivalry as to result in armed

lconflict within that territory, was not readily forseeable.

The conflict between these factions within Kansas was under control
by November, 1856. It was anticipated by'May, l8S5, that there would be a
reasonably rapid settlement of eastern Kansas but the actual rapidity of that
settlement far exceeded all expectation. It was stated in an April, 1857, issue
of The Topeka (Kansas) Tribune: “We anticipated a very large migration, but the
realization is beyond all our preconceived ideas.”
us. One of petitioner's witnesses, Eugene Ebert, extracted from the

original tract books the dates, acreages, types of transfer and consideration
per acre in each government transfer occurring in the whole township numbered

6 South within the Outlet prior to l9OS. These lands comprise about 60% of

the total area ander valuation, and may be considered representative of it all.

It is apparent from a study of the above data that the l8Sh demand for
land west of the Missouri river within Kansas and Kehraska Territories was
satiated by land lying east of t.e Outlet.

b7. Within the 30 days immediately preceding adoption of the KansasNebraska Territorial Bill the United States entered into negotiations with
seven Indian tribes or nations looking to cxtingnishment of their title to

land in Kansas. On May 6, l8Sh, the Delaeare.Tribe made outright cession of

the Outlet stri under valuation ceded an ad‘acent tract immediatel east

and reserved a small tract betwecn.the trust land and the Kansas river. On

May 10: 185k (IO Stat. IOS3) the Shawnee Indians ceded some l,hO0,000 acres

which provided for the survey of the ceded Indian land in Kansas and authorized
the President to offer the trust land there at public and private sale for not
less than its apiraised value, nor for less than $1.25 per acre for the first
three years, Commissioners were appointed to classify and appraise the trust
land. They uere advised that it was for sale at public auction in the same
manner as sales of the public domain were conducted, and told that if they
considered any part of the land not worth as much per acre as $l¢2S they

should place no value upon that acreage, and

In fixing a valuation you will regard the eligibility and

lne appraisers were instructed to first classify and appraise the
eastern half of ‘he Delaware trust land, then to appraise, in turn, the
Iowa trust land, the Peoria trust land and the western half of the Delaware

trust lands. They were also advised:

_From the peculiar nature of the country it is believed that

it will not be necessary for you to make actual view of each
and every section of these lands, but that after you shall have
made a general exploration and observation of each cession, you
will be enabled by the notes made by the Surveyor in the field,
to arrive at a proper classification and valuation of the lands

E9. (8) All of the trust lands in Kansas were appraised between

April and November, 1856. rThe eastern part of the Delaware trust land

was appraised at an average of $1.80 per acre, exclusive of town sites.

It was offered for sale in November l8S6 and as a result of the rapidity

of its disposition and the prices received Commissioner Manypenny requested
an adjustment in the appraisals placed upon the Iowa and Peoria trust lands
and the western Delaware trust lands. As a consequence the Iowa and Peoria
land valuations were increased 23¢ per acre. In some instances the western
Delaware land values were increased 25¢ per acre, some 50¢ per acre and
some were left unchanged. The final trust land valuations and acreages in

each classification of first, second or third rate land, exclusive of town

sites, were as'folloss:

First 119,662 $1.50 to $2.25
Second 76,563 $1.50 to $2.25
Third 12,360 31.50

The appraisers noted the number of “squatters” on these trust lands
and commented that the “just value” of the land would be realised only by
“a fair and open competition in the sale of the lands." (Pet. Ex. V@62).

At the time of appraisal and later efforts were made to apprise
squatters and others of the distinction between the public land to'which
Indian title was extinguished and preuemption authorized and those held in
trust for sale for the benefit of Indians.

(b) The eastern Delanare trust land bordered on the Missouri and
was bisected by the Delaware river. It was recognized that land near
Leavenworth.had azmnnitdgher value than the appraised $h.00 per acre.
Commissioner Manypenny in 1851 referred to land taken out of that military
reservation as ”worth.from $10 to $30 per acre, valued here, under the
excitement of the times at $50 per acre.” hnch of the activitr about-Fort.

settlers” who had made “lasting and valuable improvements % a n the price

fixed by the Commissioners will be considered the fair value of.the land.”

James H. Relfe, one of the appraisers, commented after the sale that the
'average price in one range would have been “much higher” if settlers had

not been granted this privilege of purchasing for the appraised value;

that the numerous squatters, who were both bona fide and speculators,

formed combines to hold down the purchase price; that quarter sections 15

to 20 miles from.Leavenworth, acquired for their appraised value, were

promptly resold for $1.25 to $3.00 per acre profit. Hany sellers immediately

filed another claim elsewhere even though such action was illegal. The sale

commissioner was aware that many spurious claims eluded his detection. By

by $10,000 (Pet. Exs. V457, V-S8). An average of $2.09 per acre was received
50? the 209;lb5 acres sold.

The western half of the Delaware trust land was offered at auction
during July and August, 1857. 3h8,8l0 acres sold for prices averaging
$1.68 per acre.

The Iowa trust land of 95,998 acres lying some ho miles north of the
Delaware Outlet on the Kansas—Hebraska state line and bordering on the
Missouri river sold in June 1857 for an average of $1.92 per acre.

The Peoria tract of 207,758 acres was situated on the headwaters of

the Osage river neaI=0ttaea, Kansas, about 30 miles south of Kansas City,

8 Irid. Cl. Corn. 130 173
some 70 miles southeast of the Outlet strip. It sold during June and July
185? for an average of $1.67 per acre.

Settlers and speculators occupied much of the choice land within each
of these last three tracts. Under instructions and conditions similar to
these surrounding the eastern Delaware trust land sales, these persons
acquired their claimed tracts at the appraised value.

50. Land 20 miles deep along each side of its tract was granted to
the Kansas Pacific Railway'Company.J The M0 mile strip ran from'wabaumsee,
Kansas, up the Kansas and Smoky'Hill river valleys to Denver. The company’
offered 1,000,000 acres lying east of Ellsworth, Kansas, in 1869 and sold
38h,l8S acres that year for an average of $2.53 per acre after payment of
more than 9¢ per acre sales expense. Three-fourths of these sales were
on credit. The Central Branch of the Union Pacific Railsay'received a
grant of 2h§,l65 acres in Kansas, some part of which was within the Outlet.
The Company's records Show that as of Hovember 1, 1880 that company had sold

70,287 acres for an average of $h.66 per acre. It is not shown what part,

if any, of these sales were within the Outlet.

51. (a) Under the Delaware treaty of l8Sh the Christian Indians were
sold a 2,571 acre tract in the northeast corner of the Delaware trust lands
for $2.50 per acre, a “mere nominal sum” accor ing to Commissioner3Manypennyx
The land.was bisected by the chief commercial route into interior Kansas, was
well timbered, and was located on the Missouri river within two miles of Fort

Leavenworth, thus having a ready available market for local produce. Various

 Ind. c1. Com. 130 1721

reports of offers to purchase t.e tract are in evidence. It sold in l8Sf
for $h3,h00, or nearly $17.00 per acre.

(b) Twentyethree sections, or lh,720 acres, north of the Kansas river,
west of the Delaware trust land, and south of the east end of the Outlet
strip, owned by the Kansas halfwbreeds, were the subject of various unofficial
reports in l8Sh to the effect that sales were being made at $2.50 per acre of
land worth as much as $6.00. These were small tract sales of timbered land
near the river, the Indian Agent reporting rumored sales saying:

Whether these lands are intrinsicall*'worth as much or more

than have been offered for them it is not in my power to

give an opinion as value is set upon land in Kansas altogether

according to their peculiar localities.

(C) Between 1839 and l86l, lh8 individual Indians in Kansas were

permitted to sell their allotments. Such sales produced an average of $6.00

would consider  arriving at xdiat he could afford to pay for the 0o.'t.let
tract in 1851;. Concluding that one could dispose of the eastern portion of
the tract within five years but that it wotild require at least ten to move
the western portion, Mr. Hall fixed his valuations accordingly.

Dr. Williaza G. Hurray, specializing in the field of land values, with
the-Iowa State U.niversity' since 1927, also testified for defendant. His
preparatory nor}: was similar to that of hr. Hc'1l1o- He found 1853.; was a
period of recession with relatively high interest rates. He called attention
to the frequent references to fertile soil but scarcity of timber and water
appearing in the original survey notes and thought the central portion of the
Outlet contained rough land not suitable to cultivation. He gave consideration
to a 2,000,000 acre tract in Missouri lying north of Kansas City and exztending
beyond St. Joseph, part of which had been offered for sale since 1821 and l8hS,

 with 35% or 750, 000 acres remaining unsold, and 33,000 acres having been on the

. .2’
.."-‘-'

-..........market over 30 years could be expected to be pnced at 12%,, per acre under the
pending Graduation Act. He also considered a 1,000,000 acre strip in Missouri’.
four ‘t-OWI‘1ShipS I-aide, extending between Kansas City and the bottom of the I-_1iami
lands, which had been available since 1828 and still. had L;5'f«§ or 150,000 acres
undisposed of. Dr. Hurray valued the better land in the Outlet at 25¢ per
acre for 100,000 acres; 300,000 acres at 15¢ per acre and 560,000 acres at
- 10¢ per acre, and an overall total valuation  13¢ per acre or $126, 000
upon it.
53. The Cc-nzcrnission finds upon a consideration of the entire record,
the foregoing findings of fact, and all the ev.'idence before us, that on
M337 5, 18574, the western S99,0‘n0 acres of the tract under valuation h.ac1 a

fair market value of 50,‘. per acre 3 that 170, 000 acres of grazing land lying

8 Ind. Cl. Com: 150 1??

on each side of the Blue river valley had a fair market value of 756 per
acre, and that the remaining 190,960 acres within said tract had a fair
market value of $1.00 per acre, thus giving to the entire Outlet tract

a total value as of May 6, 185b, of $6l7,980oOOn

_ The Commission is of the further opinion and finds that the contsideration of $10,000.00 paid the petitioner Indians upon said date for

said tract was so grossly inadequate as to constitute an unconscionable

consideration within the meaning of the Indian Claims Commission Act.
