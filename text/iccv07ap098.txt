Part II. Rgyce 262 was never specifically described in any one treaty
but its boundaries can be determined by referring to other treaties of
cession involving the adjoining areas. The two treaties of August A,
182A with the Iowa Kation (7 Stat. 231) and the Sac and Fox Kations
(7 Stat. 231) fixed the somth boundary line which coincides with the
Iowa—£iss n i 3tate line. The treaty of July l5, l83O (7 3;at. 328} with
the Sac and Fox Eation, the low Nation, and other Indians Tribes determined the north and nest boundary lines. The 3ac and Fox Treaty of
October 2l, l337 ( 7 3;at. 5&0) established the eastern boundary line.

8. Royce Cession 252 involves lands embraced within that general

area between the Hississippi and Kissouri river below the boundary line
separating the 3ioux.and Sac and Fox Tribes as fixed under Article 2

of the Treaty of August I9, l825 (7 dtat. 272) at Prairie du Chien.
Article 3 of the l825 Prairie du Chien Treaty provided that:

"The Ioways accede to the arrangement between the Sacs
and Foxes and the Sioux; but it is agreed between the Ioways
and the confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes, that the
Ioways have just nlzir to a portion of the country between
the boundary described in the next preceding article, and
the Kissouri and gississippi; and that the said Ioways,
and Sacs and Foxes, shall peaceably occ*py the same, until
some satisfactory arrangement can be made between them for
a division of their respective claims to country.”

9. In the cases of Otoe and nissouria Tribe of Indians, et al.,
v. United States, 5 IJd. Cl. Com. 351 (Dockets ll-A, l38) and the
Sac and Fox Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma, et al., 7. United States,
5 Ind. Cl. Con, 36? (D cket I58} this Commission found as a matter
of law that the language of the 1825 Prairie du.Chien Treaty amounted

‘Y-I
.""
m

to a recognition by the defendant of Iowa and Sac and ox.title to that
general.area described in Article 3 of said Treaty, even though the
specific areas actually owned were never defined.

In Docket lS8, at page L23 of the Commission's opinion, the folw

lowing is stated:

7 Ind. Cl.Com. 98 ' lO2

"In view of (our) holding made later herein that the
Treaty of August 19, 1825, called the Prairie du Chien
Treaty, is thought by us to be recognition of title in
the participants thereto the lands described therein,
we think it unnecessary to discuss in much detail the
evidence in the record as to the use and occupancy of
the land claimed by the petitioners—-this because when
Indian title has been recognized, it is unnecessary to
prove aboriginal title.”

Cession 262 lies wholly within that general area defined in
Article 3 of the l825 Prairie du Chien Treaty;

10. The Iowa Nation of Indians and the Sac and Fox;Nation have
recognized or reservation title to Cession 262, which lands are contained within that general area defined in Article 3 of the l825
Prairie du Chien Treaty. In accordance with the language of Article
3 of said treaty (see Commission‘s Finding 8) their respective interests are separate and distinct, each holding exclusively of the other
an undefined area within the cession.

ll. H'th respect to all but a relatively small portion of
Cession 262, the Iowaintion and the Sac and Fox Nation are in substantial agreement as to the areas of exclusive ownership.

(3) The Iowa Nation claims exclusive ownership of,

“that portion of Cession 262 lying south of the southern

watershed of the Racoon Fork of the Des Eoines River, and
south of the Des Koines River as far down stream as th

present village of Lddyville, and west of the line running
from.Eddyville to the Iowa—Kissouri state line at the watershed between the Grand and Chariton Rivers." (Iowa Proposed

Finding 29)
(b) The Sac and Fox Nation agree that the Iowa §ation at the time

of the l825 Prairie du Chien Treaty used that portion of Cassi n 262,

-I.‘-J

"bounded on the south by the Kissouri~Iowa state line,

on the west by the western boundar" line of Cession 262,

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 98 103

on the north by the south watershed line of the Racoon Fork
of the Des Xoires River and on the north and east by that
River as far down stream as the location of the former

upper Iowa village'wiich was apparently near the present

town of Eddyville, Iowa, and on the east by a line running
south by southwest from the Eddyville, Iowa, point to the
Missouri—Iowa 3tate line between the watersheds of the
Graniand Ch riton Rivers. " (Sac and Fox Proposed Finding 24)

I2. The Iowa Nation exerts a claim based upon joint usage with
the Sac and Fox Nation.nrior to 1825 of a portion of Cession 262 lying
east of the line drawn.fro: Eddyville, Iowa, to the Kissouri-Iowa State
line which is referred to in the Iowa Proposed Finding 29 as set out
above in the Commission‘s Finding ll(a). Iowa Proposed Finding 30

reads as follows:

"Prior to l825 the Iowa Nation used joi”tly'with the

Sac and Fox that portion of Cession 402 lying due east

of the line from bddyville to the Iowa-Eissouri State

lireireferred to in Finding 29." (Underscorino supplied)

13. The Commission rejects as unsound the Iowa claim.of title
jointly with the Sac and Fox Nation to that areaciescribed in the Iowa.
Proposed Finding 30 aased either on (a) recognized joint title under
the provisions of the 1825 Prairie du Chien.Treaty since the plain.

language of Article 3 of said treaty does not support such an interoretation, or (b) aboriginal title founded upon use and occupancy, since

".3

L

dmittedly the Iowa Nation only used the area prior to l825 and were

[11

not there at the time of the Treaty of October 19, l838 (7 Stat. 5é?7la. The Commission concludes from all the evidence that the

Iowa Nation by virtue of the prcvisions of the I825 Prairie du Chien

\.

tr*=ty'had reccg1ized title exclusively to that area within Session 262

lying southerly of line commencing in the western Eoundary of

Cession 262 and running along the southern watershed of the Raccoon

Fork until it joins the Des Hoines River to the present town of

Eddyville, Iowa, and thence westerly of a line running generally south
from Eddyville, Iowa at the watershed of the Grand and Chariton Rivers;
and, that by virtue of the provisions of the l825 Prairie du Chien

Treaty and from all of the evidence, the Sac and Fox Nation had recognized

title exclusively to the balance of Cession 262. ( See map Iowa Ex. 306)
