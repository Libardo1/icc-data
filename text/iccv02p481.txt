2. The United States desiring to negotiate a treaty with said tribes,
for the cession of a large area of land'from said tribes, to confederate
them into one tribe of Indians to be known as the Yakama (Yakima) Nation
or Tribe, and to confine said tribe to a smaller area, called a treaty
council at Walla Walla, Washington Territory, and invited the chiefs of
said tribes to attend (Cl. Ex. 15). Governor Isaac I. Stevens and General
Joel Palmer represented the United States at this treaty council. The
negotiations covered a period from May 28, 1855 to June 12, 1855 (C1. Ex.

14).

At this treaty council Governor Isaac I Stevens outlined the wishes
and desires of the United States, and on June 4, 1855 defined the area to
be reserved to the Yakima Tribes as follows (Cl. Ex. 14, p. 23, proceedings):

"The Yakama Reservation to extend from the Attannum

river--to include the valley of the Pisco river-- and from

the Yakama river to the Cascade Mountains. * * *"

3. At the treaty council, on June 5, l855, Governor Isaac I. Stevens
defined the Yakima Reservation as follows (Cl. Ex. l4, p. 26):

"Here is the Yakama Reservation, commencing with the

mouth of the Attanum river, along the Attanum river to the

cascade mountains, thence down the main chain of the Cascade

mountains south of Mount Adams, thence along the Highlands

separating the Pisco and the Sattass river from the rivers

flowing into the Columbia, thence to the crossing of the

Yakama below'the main fisheries, then up the main Yakama

to the Attanum where we began."

4. The proceedings culminated in the execution of a treaty between

the United States and said Yakima Tribes, dated June 9, 1855, ratified on

Earth 8, 1859, and proclaimed on April 18, l859 (12 Stat. 951; II Kapp.

By article l of this treaty the l
States a large area of land, and by Article 2 thereof, there was reserved for said Indians an area described therein as follows:

"There is, however, reserved, from the lands above
ceded for the use and occupation of the aforesaid confederated tribes and bands of Indians, the tract of land
included within the following boundaries, towwit: Commencing Cm the Yakama River, at the mouth of the Attairmam
River; thence westerly along said Attahnam River to the
forks; thence along the southern tributary to the Cascade
Mountains; thence southerly along the main ridge of said
m uutains, passing south and east of Mount Adams, to the
spur whence flows the waters of the Klickatat and Pisco
Rivers; thence down said spur to the divide between the
waters of said rivers; thence along said divide to the
divide separating the waters of the Satass River fr
those flowing into the Columbia River; thence along said
divide to the main Yakama, eight miles below the mouth
of the Satass River; and thence up the Yakama River to
the place of beginning.

"All which ract shall be set agart and, so far as
necessary, surveyed and marked out, for the en lusive use
and benefit of said confederated tribes and bands of

treaty to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, stating in part that

(Cl. Ex. 14, tter June 14, 1853, Stevens to Comr. Ind. AEESL):

B!t'_'1"..

-ne large reserve selected is in every resgect
adapted to an Indian reservation. It is separated from‘

a fine region of country on the Columbia river by a series
or divides extending from the Yakima River to the Cascades.
It is off from the wafgon route to the South over the
Cascades---It backs us against the Cascades, atfording a

fine range for roots, berries, and game. It has almost
inexhaustible Salmon fisheries. Ihe reserve turnishes

2 484

excellent land for farms, abundance of pine for buildings,
good sites for mills, and large ranges for horses and cattle
through the entire year. * * * A map of the country ceded
and of the reservation accompanies this report.”

6. A sketch map of the Yakima Reservation dated June 12, 1855, and
signed by Isaac 1. Stevens, Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs,
Washington Territory, one of the Treaty Commissioners for the United
States, was prepared and submitted with the Treaty of June 9, 1855.

(Cl. Ex. 2). This treaty map became misplaced in the records of the
United States soon after it was submitted, and was not discovered until
1930, after attempts were made by the United States to survey and fix the
boundaries of the Yakima Reservation in accordance with Article 2 of said
Treaty of June 9, 1855, as hereinafter outlined (Cl. Ex. 35, p. 5).

1. The boundary of the lands reserved by the treaty of June 9, 1859,
was not surveyed until long after the consummation of the treaty and then
only in sections and at different times. The first survey was made in
1861 by Berry and Lodge and was limited to the easterly and southerly
part of the boundaries. About 1890 another survey was completed by George
A. Schw rtz, a deputy surveyor, and accepted by the Commissioner of the
General Land Office on October 21, 1891. By this survey the south and
west boundaries were established as running from a point on the range
line between ranges 22 and 23 E. about a mile north of the town of
Mabton and extending southwesterly and westerly to milepost 51 and from
there northwesterly along a divide to what he considered to be the headwaters of the South Fork of Ahtanum Creel.

The next survey was made by E. C. Barnard in 1899, who extended the

2 485

southerly line established by Schwartz from milepost 5l to Grayoack Eeak,
th-toe to the Hump (east of Mt. Adams), from there northerly to Spencer

Point, thence easterly to the headwaters of the South Fork of the Ahtanum.

9. in l85 the Superintendent of Zadian Affairs for Hashitgton Terri2 486

tory made an agreement with Thomas F. Berry and James Lodge (Cl. Ex. 21)
to survey that portion of the boundary of the reservation from "the
‘divide’ between the waters of the Klickitat and Pisco rivers" to a
point on th- Yakima River, defined in the treaty as follows:

* * * thence along said divide to the divide

13

separating the waters of tee Satass Creek from
those flowing into the Columbia River; thence
along said divide to the main Yakama, eight miles
below the mouth of the Satass River, * * *.

In.making their survey, Be ry and Lodge attempted to find a point
eight miles down the Yakima River below the mouth of Satus Creek ("Satass
River?) and to proceed from that point by surveying in the reverse direction from that of the description in the treaty.

l0. The only survey that Berry and Lodge were to make was that of
the southern boundary from a point "on the Yakima River, where the
‘divide’ separatin the waters of the-Satns River from those flowing
into the Columbia River jets against said Yakima river,” southerly
and westerly until the "divide" between the Klickitat and Pisco Rivers
should be reached. However, the instruction given by the Superintendent
of Indian Affairs for Washington to Berry and Lodge stated that iflthe
intersection of the said "divide" with the Yakima River was not "plain
and apparent" they should start at the "m nth of Satus River, and run
t1e:ee—eight miles down the Yakima [river7 and from this point proceed
as previously directed." (Cl. Ens. 20 and 21, Def. Ex. 7).

The course down the Yakima River from the mouth of Satass River
(or Bates Creea) was not to form a part of the boundary survey. It was
ten for the purpose of determining the starting point of the boundary

strvty.

ll. In reporting tae courses and distances on the survey of the
southern boundary that they were requested to make, Berry and Lodge
also listed the courses and distances of a purported survey down the
Yakima River from the mouth of Satus Creek for tae purpose of determining the starting point for their bouadary survey. (Cl. Ex. 20; Def. Ex.
7; R. 338-350). However, no physical evidence of the starting point,
turning points or ending point of the Berry and Lodge survey has existed for

many years, and the alleged courses and distances cannot be harmonized

th any reasonable interpretation thereof as related to the known course

f-J:

w
of the Yakima River. There is nothing in the Berry and Lodge field notes
that shows a connecting line from the mouth of Satus Creek to any natural

ob‘ect that can be identified todry. There is no convincing evidence

12. the natural habit of minor tributaries entering a river through

a flood plain is to migrate downstream, not upstream. (Kidder, R. 566568). The witness Calvin apparently failed to take this fact into consideration in formulating his theory regarding the location of the

mouth of Satus Creek in l8ol (Kidder, R. 567), whereby he placed it turownstream in 1861 than it is known to have been in 1874 and 1885f

181-183).
l3. The first survey of the west or right bank of the Yakima

River under the direction of the General Land Office was made in

l8?4 by T. M. Reed under a contract of June 27, 1874. This contract authorized a survey and subdivision of the part of T. 9 N., R. 22 E. lying
west of the Yakima River. This survey involved the meandering of a
portion of the west or right bank of the Yakima River. The field notes
of this survey, which are a part of the records of the General Land
Office, show that after Reed had determined the point where the eastern
boundary of T. 9 N., R. 22 E., intersected the Yakima River, he made a
meander survey of the west bank from the said intersection to the mouth
of Sates Creek, which he located near the center of Section 8 of the
said township, and found such meandered distance to be 994.70 chains

or 12.43 miles. Reed had no instructions to ascertain a point eight
miles down the Yakima River and apparently made no-effort to determine
the location of such a point. (Def. Ex. 1, ll, l2, 15; R. 183; 386387, 391-393).

14. In 1885 Harry A. Clarke made a sectionalized survey of T. 9

N., R. 22 E., and also meandered the west or right bank of the Yakima
River, under instructions from the General Land Office. He submitted
complete field notes of the survey and also a plat of the township.
Clarke found the mouth of Satus Creek just north of the center of
Section 8, T. 9 N., R. 22 E., at substantially the same point where

it was found by T. M. Reed in his survey in 1874. Starting from the
Point where the eastern bonndary of township 9 was intersected by

the Yakima.River, Clarke meandered the course of the Yakima River,

R. 22 3., to be only 9.91 miles, wherein Reed, in 1874, fonn the distance between the same points to be 12.43 miles was apparently due to

the fact that Clarke took longer "shots" and did not meander the river

as accurately as Reed had. (C1. Ex. 12; Def. Ext. 13, 14, 16; R. 390394).

acne ly of the township. However, he stated that if only the general

courses were taken and some of the bends in the river ignored, the

eight miles down stream from the month of Satus Creek would end 12.2
chains (or 805.2 feet) west of the east line of the townshig. Since
Clerk found tact this range line between Townships 22 and 23 West, had
for some time been considered the east boundary of the reservation

(or at least the whites had not settled ;st of 12;, he recommended
ghee the range 113-, uh-ch was 8 miles, 12.2 chains down the river

2 489

2 490

from the mouth of Satus Creek, be accepted as the starting point for
the southeastern and southern boundary. Clarke therefore began his

boundary survey at the corner of fractional sections 25 and 30 between Ranges 22 and 23. (Cl. Exs. 27-28; Def. Ex. 16; R. 363-364).

l6. From a point in the western part of T. 6 N., R. 16 E., there

dis a divide that separates the waters flowing into Satus Creek, a

tributary of the Yakima River, from the waters flowing southward
toward the Columbia River which do not flow into the Yakima River.
This divide extends easterly to about the center of T. 7 N., R. 21 E.,
where this ridge. known as Horse Heaven Hills, ceased to form the

divide between the Satus Creek and streams flowing southerly into the

Columbia River. From about the center of T. 7 N., R. 21 E., the main

ridge extending northeasterly becomes a divide between waters that flow
northerly into the Yakima River east of the Satus Creek watershed and
the waters flowing in a southerly direction to the Columbia River. The
drainage of the major portions of T. 8 N., R. 22 E., is into the Yakima
River east of the watershed of Satus Creek. Only a small portion of the
southwestern quarter of T. 9 N., R. 22 E., and a small area in the
northwestern part of T. 8 N., R. 22 E., lie within the Satus watershed.
17. The straight lines extending south slightly more than a mile
from the intersection of the line between Ranges 22 and 23 and the
Yakima River and thence southwesterly to a point near the center of
Section 6, T. 7 N., R. 22 E., as established by Harry A. Clarke in
1885 for the southeastern boundary of the Yakima Indian Reservation
are located some distance east of the easterly limit of the watershed

E

or Satus Creek. This location of the boundary represents an interpre2 491

tation of the treaty of 1855 favorable t the Yakima Tribe. (Calvin,
R. l94~l95; Kinney, R. 371-374, 380-384, 391-398; Kidder, R. 571-572.
See oz. Exs. 11, 12, 26, 27, 28; Def. txs. 3, 9, 1G, 15, 16, 17).

we, therefore, find that the present boundary as it affects Tract A
is in conformity with the treaty description and th t Tract A is not

within the boundaries of the Yakima Reservation.

AETANUM AREA - TRAQT C

 

l8. The northern boundary of the Reservation is fixed by the
treaty as:

"Commencing on the Yakima River, at the mouth of the
tt h-nam River; thence westerly along said Attah-nam
River to the forks; thence along the southern tributary

to the Cascade Mountains; * 3 *"

'!

?Le "Attan-nam" river is now spelled ”Ahtanum", and is generally re.C .. .2. ..,.
rerled to.as a creek on modern maps.

The Ahtanum river at a point some distance west of its mouth has

two main forks designated on.modern maps as the North and South Forks

1

the Ahtanum. The natural flow of the Nortn Fork has always been

I

or
much greater than that of the South F rk and, accepting the well
established definition of the term "tributary" as being a feeder of

a larger stream, the South Fork fits the treaty call: "thence along
the southern tributary to the Cascade Mountains.” The treaty map of
Jena 12, 1855 (Cl. Br} 2) plainly shows two un-named forks of the
Ahtanum, one extending northwest and the other southwest, and th
treaty boundari, shown by a dotted line, as plainly shows the boundary
line to extend along the southernmost fork to two branches of that

Fork, one extending northwesterly and the other extending southwesterly,

and thence along tne northwesterly of such branches to the Cascade
Mountains, thus clearly eliminating the southwesterly of such branches,

now known as Reservation Creek, as a boundary line.

H4.7..‘

Neitner the North Fork nor the South Fork of the Ahtanum reaches

4-'1-n

hunt

the s*umit of e Cascade Mountains, however, the treaty makers evidently thought the South Fork did, for the treaty map shows that both

prongs or branches of the South Fork extended into spurs of the

Cascades. The North Fork,however, is not shown by the treaty map

to extend to those mountains. A natural boundary is indicated by

both the treaty call and the treaty map for the boundary extending

#5

from the Yakima (Yakama) river to the Cascade Mountai

l9. Engineer E. C. Barnard made an official examination of the

western boundary of the reservation and made his report on January 12,

1930. (Cl. Ex. 3l, pp. 6-9 and map No. 1689 attached to the exhibit).

Concerning the northern boundary from the head of the South Fork
(tributary):of the Ahtanum, he stated:

From the head of the South Fork of the Atanum

River, as it does not reach the summit of the

Cascade by some 20 miles, the boundary line should
then follow the divide around th headwaters of th
Kliokitat River, passing over Spancers Point to

Goat Rocks, which is on the main summit of the Cascade
Mo ains; * * *”

The area lying north of the headwaters of the South Fork-Spencers Point

line is shown by a green broken line on his map (No. 1689) and follows

boundary of the reservation as established by Schwartz in 1890 was

the headwaters of the stream then designated by him as the South

Fork of the Ahtanum. t seems probable that what he and the Interior

0

oriieials (and Baraard) have referred to as the South Fork was in
reality Reservation Creek (now shown on the maps as the south tributary of the Soutl Eork), for the present boundary runs along Reservation Creek to its headwaters and thence to Spoacers Point. (Der. Ex.

25, n. 3). Some administrative officials of Interior refer to the

headwaters of the South Fork of the Ahtanum as the northwesterly

corner of the reserve as fixed by Schwartz (see Def. Exs. 23 and 28)

__1

agile others refer to the headwaters of Reservation Creek as such

goint (see Def. Ex. 25, pp. 2-3), at the Indians as late as 1929

Q G

referred to Reservation Creek as forming part of tee teen 2 rthern
boundary, although they disputed its correctness. (Set. Ex. 29).
The treaty map shows that the “southern tributary" of the Ahtanum
forks a short distance west of the 121st meridian. (Cl. Ex. 2).

Modern mags (Def. Ex. 2) show these same forks (west end of the

South Fork and Reservation Creek) breaching at a point about % miles‘

east of the 121st meridian. So the a rth boundary was intended to

.9

follow the northern 0: those two branches, and not Reservation Creek,

the southern of the two branches. we, aoeordiagly, find that the

boundary line should have been established along the stream now known

as t&Q South Fork of the Ahtanum River to its source, thence alore

No proof has been made of the area between the forks of the South
Fort of the Ahtanum east of the Barnard line, so this area should be

determined and added to the 16,448 acres of the area fixed by Barnard.

WALUPT LAKE AREA - TRACT B

 

20. Tract B is an area of land, comprising about 7705 acres, lying

west of the summit of the Cascades at a place near the northwest corner
of the reservation. The crest of the Cascade Mountains forms a semicircular boundary on the east of this area. the treaty map shows

lines forming a loop enclosing Mount Adams on the south and the lines

converging at the northwest corner of the reserve. A broken line

"The testimony of the in tats, Chief Sgeneer and Stick
Joe, given in the report of last ye r, is repeated below.

’Sti k Joe said that in or about 1853 he eeeomgatied a
earty along a portion or the southern boundary line, They
l~ft the old military road at milepost 29, this teing the
point where the reserv tie: line crosses the same. They

2 495

then proceeded on the line which follows a welldetincd ridge to a peak called Grayback, on the'
summit of which a marked wooden post set in th

ground was found. At this point the surveyor, agent,
or officer accompanying the party took out a telescope
or some surveying instrument, and sighting toward
Mount Adams, pointed out a conical hump on the southeast slope of the same, told the party that tte line
now wen tstraight to that point. The party tried to
proceed in that directi n, but on account o the
precipitous nature of the mountain side had to turn
back and go around the ridge. This appears to have been
as far as the party went at this time. Stick Joe said
that the wooden post seen on Grayback has since disappeared.'"

And later in his report (at p. 9 of the Exhibit), after describing the
line from or along the summit to Mt. Adams, re says:

" * * * The boundary line would then conti.ue in a

straight line to Grayback Peak. The blazed trees at the

junction of the Indian trail w th the Goldendale road

falls south of this line about 2 miles, but this is not

surprising, as it would be impossible to locate such a

point accurately without a survey, such a survey never

having been made. In my opinion, the blazes found at this

point established the presumption that a straight line from

Grayback Peak to the hump on Mount Adams was a portion of

the southern boundary of the reserve.

“From Grayback Peak the line extends to the east along

a well-defined ridge to milepost 51 of the existing boundary.
’ . She forked tree and line of blazes extending up the ridge
from milepost 29 on the old military road appear to me ample
evidence that this ridge was part of the intended boundary,
although the true ridge that the line must follow is a l ttle
to the south of milepost 29.

“Granted that the line started from milepost 51 of the

existing boundary down the ridge toward Grayback, and certainly
the testimony of Chief Spencer and tick Joe is str ne evidence,

»nd, when strengthened by the evidence found in the field, I
believe incontestible, the boundary line as indicated in green

23. She Barnard line extending between Graytack Peak and Goat Butt

{she Hump) was approved April 7, 19;o (Ci. Ex. 35, p. 4) and by the Act

or December 21, 1904, 33 Stat. 595, and the line located on the ground by

an ojficial survey made in 1907 by Campbell, Germond and Long. (Cl. Ex. 35,

PAIENTED LANDS IN YAKEMA RESERVATION

 

26. Prior to 1904, it had been discovered that through the erroneous

strvey (Schwartz) made in 1890 the Indians had been deprived of 293,837 acre

1'’

or their lands which had been excluded from their reservation, and part of
the lands in the excluded area had been disposed of by defendant to settlers
and purchasers under the public land laws. To meet this situation there

was enacted the Act of December 21, 1904, 33 Stat. 595, section 1 of which
contained the following provisions:

That the claim of said Indians to the tract of land adjoining their present reservation of the west, excluded

by erroneous boundary survey and containing approximately
two hundred and ninety-three thousand eight hundred and
thirty-seven acres, according to the findings, after examination, of Mr. E. C. Barnard, topographer of the Geological
Survey, approved by the Secretary of the Interior April
seventh, nineteen hundred, is hereby recognized, and the
said tract shall be regarded as a part of the Yakima Indian
Reservation for the purposes of this Act: Provided further,
That where valid rights have been acquired prior to March
fifth, nineteen hundred and four, to lands within said tract
by bona fide settlers or purchasers under the public-land
laws, such rights shall not be abridged, and any claim of
said Indians to these lands is hereby declared to be fully
compensated for by the expenditure of money heretofore made
for their benefit and in the construction of irrigation
works on the Yakima Indian Reservation.

 

7. Pursuant to the validation provisions of the 1904 Act, patents
have been issued to settlers and purchasers of lands within such excluded

urea, referred to in Finding 26 hereof, to the extent of 27,647.71 acres

rs--. -‘
