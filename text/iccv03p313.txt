represent said tribe in the prosecution of the claim set forth in the
first cause of action pleaded in the amended petition herein.

The ‘second and third causes of action appearing in said amended

petition were dismissed by order dated August 30, 1951, and are set

forth in Docket No. 157.
2. _The land which is the subject of this claim is hereinafter

described in Finding 3 and is a part of a larger area of land consists ing of 3,053-I-,l82 acres located in shat isnow the ‘hate of Wyoming, and
which was set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation

of the petitioner by a treaty between the petitioner and defendant

33(3). on September 26, 1872, 18 Stat. 291, the petitioner and

defendant entered into an agreement, which was approved by an Act of

ce11_€'51'ee3 011 December 15» 1571*: by which the petitioner ceded to defendant

that part of their reservation acquired by said treaty of July 3, ld'68,

Lvins -9'south of a line beginning at a. point on the east boundary
of the-Shoshone and Bannock reservation, dne. east to the
mouth of the Little Papa-Agio at its junction with the PapoAgie, and running from said point west to the month of;the ‘
Little Papo-Agie; thence up the Papo-Agie to the North

Fork. and up the North Fork to thenonth of the canyon;

As consideration for said cession of 700,632 acres of petitionIndians the sum of $5000 each year for a period of five years and to pay
to Wash-a-hie, ‘Chief of the Shoshones, for a term of fiveyears. the sun
of $500 each year as a salary. Defendant. in accordance with the provisions of said agreement, expended $25.000 for the use of said Indians

and paid said chief‘ a salary aggregating‘ $2500.
11-. One Felix Brunot represented defendant in negotiating the agree-F

nent of September 26. l872,.referred to in Finding}, and on Qctober 18,

1872. and in reporting the same to the Secretary of the terior (Def.

E7... 21}, pp. he wrote:

____.._,..'_......._._ .. ._......

In regard to the price to ‘be paid for this large bodyof land, I respectfully ask your attention to the following
considerations: - - - '

Acting upon my experience of the general habit of Indians,
the Shoshones wereoffered a em on the ‘basis of further

negotiation, and which I supposed would have to be increased
to meet the demand of the Indians. When theterms first

offered were promptly accepted. _I did not feel at liberty to
make an addition it seemseminently proper to solicit from

Congress.‘ The appropriation of an additional sum of $10,000,
to be expended in the erection of houses. for such of the

Indians as are willing to make permanent settlement in th
and to cultivate the'soi1,'1rcm_.ld be just.'_' _ '

The 1873 cession, ‘because of the name of the Government's represen-'tative in negotiating it, became known andis now commonly icnown as the
Brunot lands or cession, and for ‘brevity will he so referred to here?after.

5. The bulk of the Brnnot land; as of thedate of the‘ cession was
best adapted to stock raising. '3. small hut fertile portion of these
lands was highly s1ri.ta'ble, with irrigation as crop lands and these
agricultural lands for the most part were to he found in the north
central portion of the tract in the valleys in three townships and two
fractional townships in the vicinity of Lender. (Pet. Ex. 3. Appendix
F; Def. Ems. 52 and 53). With the exception of these agricultural lands
the tract is, topographically speaking, for the most part rolling and
mountainous. Approximately 30% of the lands are considered timhered
lands, 65$ grazing lands and 5% or less agricultural lands. (Def. 3:.
259. p. 125; Pet. Ex. “D”, p. 190). Some 219,87‘! acres of these lands
are today in the Lander Division of the Shoshone Rational For est and
70,000 acres of this timhered area. are in the “wild mea” of rough

along the Continental Diride. (Def. E11. 259, p. 125; Def.
Ex. ISO).

a Territory in 1868, and"ad1nitted as the Imth State" on Ju.ly'lO, 1390.
Wyoming is the 8th largest state, with an area of 62,150,720 acres and
today ranks ‘Nth-__in population. a '1 ° '

__ 7. ' The history of the Brunet area--‘begins with the discovery of South l

Pass over the Continental Divide in 1822 by Ashley, a fu.r_‘trader. Until

1593: this area remained known only to the Indians; the _fur tradersend

explorers, After 183-L3, however, reports of rich lands in Oregon started

.-:‘.‘a—~.

.3"

the overland trek to that country ‘by settlers_an<_1 in a fey; years  s i

moved over the Oregon Trail-through South Pass ‘and on to_the Oregon
country. i In 18115. the Mormons _too passedthrough-_on theirzway to the

valley of the Great Salt Lake in that is how Utah. In.“ 18%, this western.

traffic gas increased tremendously with the discovery ofgold in Cd:ifornia.

Road. ranches sprung up along the route of these emigrants to supply them

vith fresh animals, supplies of hay. and other commodities. These emigrants paid little attention to Wyoming ezceptas part of their trip made

more difficult by mountains and hostile Indians. Few, if any, gave

thought to the idea of stopping to make their homes in a. land which seemed
to present little or no opportunity. The beginning of settlement in the
South Pass area just outside the Brunet lands really commenced with the

discovery of the Carissa lode in 1867 at South Pass and some 1.5 mining

.,—.-....—-.. .-..—. _..camps were opened in rapid succession in the South Pass district, which
became known as the Sweetwater mining area, including the mining towns
of South Pass°City, Atlantic City; and Miners‘ Delight. (Def. Er. 225,

p. 71). In 1861, the Union Pacific first penetrated the eastern ‘oonndary

of southern Wyoming and with it came the railroadtowns inhabited ‘by
people who followed the construction of the railroad and were dependent.
upon it for labor and subsistence and they lived in transient and tempo-.
rary homes which were moved to each new point on the railroad that served
as a center of activity for each newiwestward emansion of the railroad
across Wyoming. (Def. Est. 210, p. 28). The railroad too}: little‘ or no
interest in building up the ‘territory and the policy of the road was not
to build up local traffic but rather to secure -through traffic to; the
Pacific Coast. The railroad reached the weste_rn"boundary of Wyoming
quickly and ‘by 1869, in May, _the_golden spike was driven in Utah where the
Union Pacific and Central_Pacific met. (Def . E. 228, p. 85). With the
completion of the railroad across the territory the bull: ofuthe railroad
transient population advanced westward with it. The inhabitants of the
mining camps were for the most part a fluid population also, and ‘by theend of .1870, the once flourishingtmining district of the Sweetwater area
there several thousand miners and others had rushed to following the
strike of 1867, was practically deserted due to the discovery of gold
elsewhere in Montana and Hevada and due also to Indian dgredations inuthe
vicinity of South Pass. (Def. E22. 228, p. 91). e
8, Wyoming, which became a territory by the Act of July 25, 1868,

had a total population in 1870 of 9,118. (Def. Er... 228, ‘p. 71;). Oi‘ the

9,118 persons, the Sweetwater mining district totaled about 2000 inhabitants.

Pass City 1:6o_ and _Smith's'Gnlch 159. (Def. Ex. 146: ne:.__sz. 27). The
actual working sheets of the 1870 census show that with but few exceptions
the population of the_se communities was made up of miners and townsfolk.
(Def. Er. 11-7). Ogitside of the mining campsthere were few settlers on

the Shoshone Reservation prior to the 1872 treaty. Some of these

settlers had gone on the land prior to the creation of the reservation

by the treaty pf 1868. In 1868, five settlers settled on Little Wind

River, and four in the va.lley_of’_the Big ‘Pope Agie. In 1869, two

settled on the Little Pope Agie andstwo in Red Canyon... Agent Imin

reports in 1872 that there were eight settlers on the reservation in

-r----."-";'|u

sight of the agency and four in the Popoagia valley fourteen miles south
of the agency. Eight of the settlers were still within the reservation
which remained after the cession. They were ordered to leave the reser-l
vation and made claims for their improvements. Ehese settlers reported
seven settlers in Popo-Agie Valley, fear on the Little Popo-Agie and

two in the Red Canyon. Thus, ‘but a handful of settlers were actually
within the lands ceded by the 1872 treaty.

The once flourishing gold mining communities in the South ‘Pass area
began to peter out by the end of 1870 as the miners went elsewhere, and
in l872, Bronot estimated the population of South '.?a.ss, Hamilton
(Hiz1ers' Delight) and Atlantic City at less than 100 each. The Federal
Census of 1880 gives the population of Wyoming as 20,789. In l880,

Sweetwater County had a population of 2561, while in 1870, it was 1916

-,§-,_, persons. In 1880, the population of Atlantic City was_82; Miners‘ Delight

1:2. South Pass 37. In 1880,‘-Lander had a population of._l93. -(Def. Ex.‘ 143).
In 1883, the Governor of Wyoming reported Wyomingjferritory hada population
of 35,000 with more than half of these persons located in the towns on the

Union Pacific line.; (Def. E1. 187; Def. Ex. 2340, p. 901).; In l8S_1¥,.

proportienwith increases in elevation. Snow packs at the higher elevations restrict grazing use to relativelyshort summe-.r'periods. Ehe
climate of the valleys is therefore said to feature relatively mild open
winters considering the elevation and"location.' The climate of the area
is very favorable for grazing utilization due to the protection afforded

by the surrounding mountains which afford shelter from much  and many

severe storms.

10. Transportation. As of the date of the Agreement of September 26.

1872, the nearest railroad to the Brunet lands was the mien Pacific; the

only railroad in Wyoming. The nearest railroad station was Bryan, located

I about 100 miles from the Brunet lands. Wagons were used to  material

-to the mining camps. 'Ehese freighters received_three to five cents, per

pound. Smplies were ‘brought to Camp Brown on the Little Wind River hy . 

wagon from Bryan and required twelve to twenty days in: transit. For years

the Brunet area. was to be retarded in itsdevelopment due to the lack of

transportation facilities. As late as l8_89, it was reported that although
some oil wells near Lander had been developed no oil had been shipped since

the wells were lOO miles from a railroad. (Def. Ex. 76, _p. 865; Def. Ex.

78). The area was not to have railroad service until l906, when the Wyoming
and Northwestern Railroad was completed from Casper to Lander. (Def. Ex.

77, Def. Ex. 85, p. 518). Ithzas the completion of the railroad lines which

cut down prohibitive wagon hail rates which opened up such. areas in Wyoming
as the Brunet lands and made the mineral an agricultural lands within them
a. commercial proposition.

(Def. Ex. 92; Def. Br. 2011, pp. 5, 11, 12;
Def. Ex. 228, p. 90).

1868, which set -aside the Shoshone Reservation, gold was discovered’ in
the South Pass area and miners rushed into the country. A few persons
also settled in the ‘valleys and began to cultivate the soil. When it

was discovered that the reservation included the mining claims and the

lands which the handful of settlers had preempted, agitation developed

won the part of the miners and settlers through Government officials to

obtain a cession of the Brunot lands in order that they might receive a.

more assured title in the lands. At the date "of_the treatyoof l872, however, the mining camps were almost deserted and there werebut a handful

of settlers otherwise on the Brunot lands.

Following the Treaty of 1872, surveys of these lands mre commenced.‘
The surveys took place between the years l877 to. 1892. Some 58,000 acres
still have not been surveyed. These nnsurveyed lands are in the northwestern mountainous portion of the cession. A study of the field notes
of survey shows that the townships within the cession were very sparsely
settled at _the dates of survey, with few claims located thereon. The
exception to this observation was the settlement of the good agricultural
land in the north central part of the cession, near Lander, where in the
valleys in these few townships the lands were almost all taken up by the
time of the surveys. By 1890, however, only 22,}-I-16.72 acres of the total
cession of 700,67-.l2 acres were in private ownershi . (Def. Ens. 6? and 69).
These lands in private hands were for the most part situated in the few

good agricultural townships in the north central part of the cession with

a. very limited number of acres in other valleys, also being privately

neighborhood of ‘the Pope Agie. His men used the oil for the galled

dispute as tojtheexact location of these “tar springs” hut Geologist
Eilbur c. Knight identifies the Pope .Agie'_jField as being the same as
what is now known as the Dallas home field withinthe Bronot lands. Knight

reports that this field remained unknown except togthe hunter and trapper

until 1867. Upon completion of the Union Pacific people ‘became interested

and the property changed hands "several times prior to l8§0 but there was

no development except pits sunk as assessment holes. Kz3.i§3.t reports one

packed and__remained so until the time of his report (1897). Ee also

reported that oil flowing from leaks was utilized ‘by ranchers for lubricating purposes and to some extent-by the gold mines_end the flour mill.
Knight locates these wells as ‘being on the Little Pope Agie river, ten

miles southeast of Lender, at that time over lO0 miles from any railroad.

Knight stated the development of the oil fields in the area depended

entirely upon the construction of a railroad into the section to furnish

Simply the_small city of Lender and the few inhabitants in the sparsely
settled region. The market was also small because of an abundant growth
of wood in the Wind Biver Mountains, which was used for fuel.
P. 5347; see also Def. 11:3. 86, 87, 88, 89, 92 and 93). ‘Ens commercial
development of coal on the Brunot lands had to await the coming of the

railroad and the resulting lower rates of transportation. Prior to 1906,

the production was small for a small local trade. (Def. Bass. 86, 87, 88,

89. 92. 93. 9!}. 95. 102 (pp. 009.33% 631)).

Gold was discovered inrthe South Pass area including

Liiners"Delight on't3_n_e Brunet lands in 1868 priorlto the_setting aside

of the Shoshone Reservation in that year. By 1872, the mining camps were

almost deserted,__the miners having gone to new gold fields in Montana and

Nevada. ‘foe facts are that practically all the gold had been taken out,
by the date of the 1872 agreement, aid the high cost of production and

Indian depredations caused an abandonment of mining in that area until

1931;.

lands. ‘a"Iithin this area of timber which today is part of the Shoshone

Rational Forest some 70,000 of the acres are in the “wild area” along

the Continental Divide which is so classified because of inaccessibility

and rough topography. me imbered area was not considered to have roads

suitable for commercial operations and access to the timber was difficult .

-(Def. Ex. 85 ,

_ _, ____....... ...._.................cCommercial timber operations within the area have been practically nonexistent. Some timber over the years has beentcut for local use but the

591118-mi has been limited. 's'.Ehe only commercial timber type is almost pure

1°<1€9Pole pine. Many of the stands of timber are less than ten inches

in diameter, breast high. There is no evidence that the timbered area

as of 1872 had any real commercial value. me use of the timber was

limited to purely small local needs such as fuel, logs for mines and railroad ties. (Def.-E1. 76). The timbered areas of Wyoming have been reported

to be more valuable for grazing, recreation and watershed protection than

as timber producers. (Def. Er. 195; Def. m. 56, p. 66).

15. Demand for Land in Wy oming. ‘For 160 years after the Territory

of Wyoming was organized it was a range state. Some coal was mined by the

Union Pacific but nine—tenths of its area was firstoccupied by herds of

cattlegand later sheep. It was regarded as an unfenced wilderness and

the national home of the cowboy and sheep herder. It was a frontier land.

line early pioneers found the territory in the possession of the Indians.
It was not until the surrender of the Sioua: to General Crooks in_l877 and
1878 that the raids against the settlers were stopped. The greaterp-art
of the area of Wyoming being a.<1apted_'to grazing it was onlynatural that
its development would be in the direction of stock; raising when it became
3858 to use the lands following the end of Indian hostilities. Ede pattern
of land use for Wyoming developed in the early days had a direct effect
upon the demand for land. The cattlemenfisought “free range“ upon the

public domain in isolated areas. 'Ehey needed large areas of land upon

which to graze their stock and they could not afford to buy the land. These

cattlememwere confronted with the problem of controlling the grazing

land on the public domain "to prevent overcrowding and tojpreserve the

individual‘s share.‘ The only way he could legally assert the control

was by obtaining title to water courses, thus mal:i.ng the grazing land

valueless to anyone who did not have access to water‘. (Def. Ex. 21¥l,_

PP. ll)-F-117, 1811-). The coming of the granger on to these hitherto “free”
ranges presented a. problem to the stock raiser. ihe large ranchers tool:

to fencing _-the public lands. (Def. Ex; 2141, pp. 192. 193. 1974»), The

Wyoming cattlemen urged Congress in 18834 to enable the cattle industry

to acquire by lease the right to graze upon unoccupied land. (Def. Ex. 211-1,
:9. 201). Every effort was made by the ranchers to obtain title to stream
sites through purchase. or under the homestead, preemption, or desert, land
laws. in the_ early 1880's in Wyoming. (Def. Ex. 281!-I,:pp. 201%, 205 and 206).
Adding to the problem of the cattlemen in the middle 80‘s was the acquisition
of alternate sections of railroad. grant lands.‘ Much of this grazing land

was purchased by large cattle companies for 50¢ to $1.00 an acre, which

they fenced in and by so doing the alternate sections of government land
were also enclosed. Public policy and laws prevented the large stock
raisers from acquiring large blocks of government land even if they could u
have afforded to purchase them. (Def. Ex. 21frl, pp. 2ll,_2l2) . ’.?he "i;-xpasse”

The cattlemen of Wyoming in 1886 were in the grip of a. depression.

disaster on the open range was complete, with 85 per cent or more of the

herds destroyed. The open range cattle industry was at an end and a new

329136 of range industry, depending on supplemental feed, developed and the
development of irrigation began to be closely associated with the shift
of the stock-growing industry from the open range to the ranch basis in
order to obta.in supplemental feed. (Def.'Ex. 2741, PP. 218-231). With
this shift came the necessity of acquiring title to lands which ‘could be
irrigated. By 1900, the land held was chiefly irrigated land or unimproved
pasture which from the stockraisingpoint of view represented haystaclcs
for winter and enclosed pasture for  (grazing. (Def. Ex, 2341, pp. 23123'{ inc_l.), _' _-_

!'L‘he_ pattern of land use therefore was to obtain title to the water
sites  later to the portions of land nearby which could be irrigated.
Even after the shift to the ranch basis from the open range concept, ‘the
ranchers continued to make use of the public lands. is late as 1906,
the unappropriated and unreserved lands in Wyoming, much of which was
grazing land, amounted to 33,998,249 acres of surveyed and 2,728,088 acres
of unsurveyed lands fora total of 36,726,337 acres. (Def. Ex". 206). It
was not until_'the passage of the Taylor Grazing Act of 1931-!» thatrthe
Government began to charge a fee for the use of these public lands.

Ehe demand otherwise or land inwyoming did not come until about
1905 when the "population began to push westward from Nebraska. Land
¢0mPan.ies brought into southeastern and eastern Wyoming hundreds of

settlers who attempted dry farming. Substantial settlement did not come,

the

however, until the development of large reclamation projects such as

‘find Ever Project. (Def. Er. 228).

17.; Disposal of Public Lands in Wyomin . The public lands of
Wyoming were subject to entry under the public land laws of the United

States which included pre-emption and homesteading. Under the Preemption Act, people were entitled to pre-empt up to l60 acres of land,
surveyed or unsuryeyed, npon't3:_1e payment of $1.25 per acre, cash. Under
the 1862 Homestead Act, any adult could obtain 160 acres free, ‘by paying
a. small filing and registration fee and agreeing to improve and live on
it for five years. There were available in Wyoming,, which contains some
62,000,000 acres of land, many millions of acres subject to such entry
from 1872 on. The following table shows the acreage surveyed and the
disposals in Wyoming from 1868 through lS80: (Der. Ex. 72).

In 1898, there ware still 349,311-1,533 acres of public 18.315. in Wyoming

vacant and subject to entry. (Def. Ex. 239, p. 111:-). In 1898, there were

5,683,126 acres unreserved and unappropriated in Fremont County out of a.

301‘-al acreage of 5,861,120 acres within the County. (Def. E31. 239, _p. 3.15).
As late as--July 1, 1926, Wyoming had 19,83-$9,762 acres of nnappropriated
public land and as of that date there were 3,150,’-.187 acres of unappropriated and unreserved landin Fremont County. * (Def. Ex. 19?, p. 5).
Hthough the first homestead entry in Wyoming was completed in 1870,’

it was not until the late l880"s and early 1890's that a tide of settlement came into the ‘state under the homestead la:-:s..-; (Def. Est. 228, p. 100).

meat of__ September 26, 1872. _'(5.‘.; 2l'{, 218; Def. Ex. 259, p. 160).. There

‘was no demand for the lands in that area at that time except 'oy‘_ the handful of settlers within the Brunet lands.’ (T. 373-). There is, therefore,

a complete lack of market data as of that date with respect to the value

attached to lands in Jfyozning Territory. Besides the Govement disposals

the only other sales of note within Wyoming anywhere near the date ofp_the

_ Agreement inttolved the sales of grant lands ‘by the Union Pacific Railroad

- which was created in 1862. By 3.870, the Union Pacific had completed its

track through Wyoming and had earned under the Act about 12,000,000 acres
of lands with about 1;,800,000 of these in Nebraska, 11,600,000 in Wyoming,

700,000 acres. in Colorado and l,l00,000 in Utah. (Def. Ex. 120). In

1873, the Union Pacific had sold no lands west of Grand Island. B-ehraska...

(Def. as. 119, . 937; Def. Est. 125; Def. Ex. 128).‘ Of the approximately‘

34,500,000 acres the railroad received in gents in Wyoming, most of the

land was classified as grazing land. (Def. Ex. ll9, pp. 936, 937). The

On grazingland at 7 per cent interest. By 1883, only 2520 acres of these

lands had been sold in Wyoming. (Def. Er. 211.-l, p. 210). In 1881;, the
railroad entered into contracts of sale for large tracts in Wyoming Territory whereby.so1ne 2,000,000 acres were sold extending from the eastern __
boundary of the Territory west to--the vicinity of the North Platte River

at Fort Steel in an almost continuous ‘body. One of the purchasers was the

Durchase of 286,1!-73.08 acres of these lands was later cancelled and the
lands allowed to revertto the__railroad. (Def. Eng. 111.-5; Def. Ex. 220,

P» 225)., In 1887, the railroad had on hand 3,168,990 acres of landminsold, which lands were almost entirely in Wyoming west of Ear.-lins (Def.
re. 119, P. 937). and although at that date the railroad had fixed a
ninimm of $1.00 an acre on these lands which conld he purchased in large
tracts only (net. Er. 119; Def. Ex. 128, p. 1;; Def. Ex. 76, p. 828), the
railroad, however, continued to sell thousands of acres of grant lands
in Wyoming in large tracts, both before and after 1900, ifor about 50
