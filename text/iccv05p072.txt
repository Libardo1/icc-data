DEPREDATEON PAYKEETS

27. Payments of depredation judgments involving only the petitionstribes are summarized in G. A, 0. report (Dis. Sch. 2, p. S), for fiscal

years 1901 through l9l9 at $l,S63,§h8.00e Defendant concedes with

respect to this sum that it could find no record of a Lipan Band of

Comanches against which band a judgment in the sum of $2180.00 is included in the G. A. 0. report (Def. Reg. Fdg. 26, subfinding 1"). Defendant claims, therefore, a net offset of $1,561,368.00 on the depre"tion judgments against petitioners’ awardo
a. The accounts summarized in this schedule are each based
on a certified copy of the judgment of the Court of Claims, a.certificate
of payment by the auditor for the Department of the Interior and related

papers. There are llOh such accounts involved. Samples of such judg—
‘W I

ments and accounts are in evidence as defendant's Exhibits 28, 28a, 28b,

and 29.

b0 The judgments were rendered.under the Indian Depredations
Act of March 3, l89l, section 6 of’which reads (26 Stat. 853):

SEC. 6. That the amount of any judgment so rendered"
against any tribe of Indians shall be charged against the
ribs by which, or by members,cf'uhich, the court shall

find that the depredaticn was committed, and shall be
deducted and paid.in the following manner: First, from
annuities due said tribe from.the United States; second,
if no annuities are due or available, then from any other
funds due said tribe from the U.‘ted States, arising from
the sale of their lands or otherwise; third, if no such
funds are due or available, then.from any appropriation
for tie benefit of said tribe, other than appropriations
for their current and necessary support, subsistence an

appropriation is due or available, amount of
the judgment shall be paid from the Treasury of the
United States: Provided, That any amount so paid from

against such tribe, and shall be deducted from any
annuit , fund or appropriation hereinbefore designated
which may hereafter become due from the United States
to such tribe.

c. These disbursements were made under identical appropriations

for: “Judgments, Indian Depredation Claims,“ G..A. 0. Report, at page 5.

The year, date, citation of act and amount appropriated are listed in

original G. A. 0. Report of 1951, at pages 181 and 182.1 The pertinent

language of the last Act of Jmky 8, 1918, to Stat. 821, 837, follows:

Interior, haying due regard to the educational and other
necessary requirements of the tribe or tribes affected;
and the amounts paid shall be reimbursed to the United
States at such times and in.such proportions as the
Secretary of the Interior may decide to be for the
interests of the lndian Service:-% sea

The pertinent language of all of the preceding appropriations is
identical, except the Act of August 26, 1912, 37 Stat. 595, 617=-618,

the amounts paid shall be reimbursed to the United
tates: % % %.

This 1912 Act included an appropriation for $719.00 for depredations
committed by Comanche Indians before 1891 and the judgment therefor was

paid by defendant and, insofar as the record discloses, the defendant

has not been reimbursed.therefor.

d. The Secretary of the Interior, as required by each of the
acts, except that of August 26, 1912, supra, appropriating money to pay
the depredation judgments of the petitioners (aggregating $l,S63,Sh8,
less $2180), certified as to each of llO3 of the judgment claims, substantially as follows:

% % % I hereby certify that none of the tribes or nations
of Indians against'whom the above specified judgments
‘were rendered have any annuities due them.from the United
States or any other funds due then from the United States
arising from.the sale of their lands or otherwise, nor is
there any appropriations for their benefit other than the
appropriation for their current and necessary'support,
subsistence and education available for the payment of
the judgments rendered against them, or out of which the
same should be paid, due regard being had to their educational and other necessary requirements.

e. By Article II of the Act of June 6, 1900, 31 Stat. 672,
680; I Kapp. 70h, 712, Congress provided, in acquiring the land here
at issue, that none of the cash consideration for said land should be

subject to payment of dep-edation judgme-tso

as follows:

The article reads, in part,

That none of the money cr interest thereon which is,
by the terms of the said agreement, to be paid to said
Indians shall be applied to the payment of any judgment
that has or may hereafter be rendered under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved March third,

The sums claimed by defendant based on expenditures made by the United

it Would appear that the vouchers showing these expenditures would indicate the tribal membership of the delegates, or at least the tribe or

The testimony of defendant’s vitness on this item is that the voucher
or other evidence of er.penditur'e, available in the General Accounting
Office, in most cases gave the name of the individual, Indian who was the
recipient of the expenditure or service (Tr. 1352). While a few sample
vouchers were introduced into evidence to explain the nature of the expenditures (Def. Exs. 32c, 32e, 32f, 321), and though the name of the
beneficiary appears on each voucher, in no case has defendant proved that
the recipient of the e:«:penditure or item was a member of a petitioner
tribe. Whe n, in the nature of things, evidence is available to Show
tribal membership of a recipient of Government funds but the defendant
fails to supply such evidence, we are not ;§ustified in charging the costs,

In fiscal.year l90l, the sum of $27,553.11 for provisions was expended for such items as lh6,000 lbs. of ilour, 703,086 lbs. of beef
cattle, 52,500 lbs. of flour and 36,035 lbs. of corn. In fiscal year
1902, provisions included, among others, such items as lO8,99l.826 lbs.
of beef cattle and 89,750 lbs. of flour. Expenditures for these provisions,
together with purchases of coffee, sugar, salt and bacon, were made yearly

between 1901 and l9lO inclusive, although follow‘.g 1902 the disbursements were considerably less than before.
On September 1, l902, the agent at the Kiowa Agency reported on.the'
general condition of the Indians as follows: (Pet. Ex. lh3-l(b))

The larger number live in houses on their allotments and 5, are manifesting considerable pride in the ownership of individual homesteads, and in very many cases their houses are

furnished well with comforts and conveniences which equip

civilized home life. % % % There are~no vagabond beggars

among these Indians. In some pa‘, even the poorest among

them make out with what they receive from the income of their

lands, so that no real suffering from poverty is know-.anong

then.

The Kiowa, Comanche and.Apache, as a.r
good fortune that has befallen,tlen in th
surplus lands of their reservation to settl - U
and realize the justness of being thrown for the 0
upon their cwn.resources for livelihood. Congress at ts
last session made no appropriation for th ir support during

ha

the ensuing fiscal year, and they understand that they are
expected to support themselves through their own efforts
upon their allotments and the money derived from the sale
of their surplus lands under act of June 6, 1900, and the
rents received from their pasture reserves which.are held
in common.

Defendant is entitled to offsets for 73% of the sums expended for
provisions for the fiscal years 1901 and 1902 only, during which period
a total of $h8,863.h3 was disbursed, or $35,670.30. The remaining sum
of $1,179.60 expended for provisions from 1930 through 19hO consists of
small items mostlv for miscellaneous provisions and is not a proper offset.

Defendant claims expenditures totaling $29.07 for transportationi

of agricultural.inp1enents and equipment. This sum was expended between
the years l9l2»l92l, and after such articles were made available for sale
to the Indians on credit. These items are not proper offsets. A snm.of
$h8.05 is claimed by defendant for the transportation of clothing over a
period of years. No explanation as to the use planned for such clothing
or its distribution is made by defendant. The items making up the sum

of $h8.0S for trcnsportation of clothing are denied as offsets. The expenditure cf the sums of $201.88 for transportation of hardware, glass,
oil, and.paints, $212.h9 for the transpdrtation of household equipment and
supplies, and $8.00 for transportation of feed for livestock are denied
as proper offsets (see Findings 35 and.37). ‘In 1918, the sum of $12.80

e expenditure of $19.80 for agricu_tural aid was made for the
purchase of 53% gallons of lubricating oil in 1901. This may well have
been an agency expense. It is not a proper offset. Of the items under
“Agricultural Implements and.Equipnent,“ the sum of $533.07 was expended
in 1901 for parts for nosing machines. In 1901, ten mowing machines were
purchased and defendant has been allowed an offset for the machines
(Finding 32). In 1909, the sum of $lh3.79 was expended for agricultural
implements and equipment and a sum of $h28.h8 in 1910, making a total of
$l,l05o3h under this heading. It is not possible to determine from.the
record.whether these items were used by the agency, issued.to the Indians
or sold to the Indians on credit, and, therefore, are not proper offsets.

Hardware, glass, oil and paint items in the sum of $7S.1h and household

, ‘\

equipment and.supplies in the sum of $38.85 appear to be.most likely

agency expenditures and are denied as an offset. (See Fdg. 35).

Lb. Defendant claims offsets tota-ing $Ll3.6O in the G. A. 0. report

é

under “Mills and Shops.“ This sum includes expenditures for the black»

smith, carpenter, machine and tin shops. These shops no doubt were

fendant for pay and expenses of nerd-rs, Spockmen; bl3Ck5mith5= butchers’

carpenters, harness—makers and general mechanics. These items were

expended w'Z._m.arily for agency or administrative services and are not

proper offsets.

b5,_ A total of $7,39§,o6 is claimed as offsets by defendant for

surveying and allotting expenditures. Of this total; $3:8O7°72 335

expended in 1901 and the remainder in 1907. There appears to be no

evidence of record as to what lands were teing surveyed and allotted to

j_-_qcu'_r_~ these iterrs of e:=:penditm~e. D‘.}_'I"iI"9, the year 1901, the United States

1901, 31 gtai. 727 (Def_ 3x_ 27, p, 3L). In the absence of proof as to’
whether the lands for which the items of expenditure Were made were those
of petitioner tribes, the items are not proper offsets»
