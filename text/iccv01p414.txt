0‘Marr, Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission:

By the petition filed in this case eight members of the Eastern‘
(Emigrant) Cherokee Indians have presented a claim for and on behalf
of all the members of that part of the Cherokee Nation of Indians who
became known as the Eastern or Emigrant Cherokeesc

They seek an award

against the United States in the sum of $992,550.31 with interest at

the rate of 5% per annum from November 3, 1906. The three items mak—
ing up this claim will be referred to later.

Early in the nineteenth century the Cherokee Indians lived eastl
of the Mississippi river in parts of the States of Georgia, Alabama,

Tennessee and the Carolinas. Part of the Cherokees, which became

known as the Western or Old Settler Cherokees, moved west of the Mississippi river and finally located in what is now the State of Oklahoma.

See treaty of May 6, 1828, 7 Stat. 311. After the settlement of the

Western Cherokees in Oklahoma, the Cherokee Nation ceded to the United
States for a consideration of $5,600,000 (Treaties of December 29, 0
1835, 7 Stat. M78 and March 1, 1836, 7 stat. has) all its remaining 0
lands lying east of said river and moved to the western Cherokee lands

in what is now the State of Oklahoma and settled thereon and on the

y800,000—acre tract acquired from the defendant by the treaty of 1835.

Attorneys‘ Fees

A dispute arose between the Eastern Cherokees and the deiendant
as to the handling of the treaty fund and other matters, and by the
act of July 1, 1902, 32 Stat. 726, as amended by the Act of March 3,
1903, 32 Stat. 996, the Cherokee Nation and the Eastern Cherokees were
permitted to sue the United States in the Court of Claims for any claim
they may have against the United States arising under treaty stipulavi
tions. Accordingly, separate suits were brought by the Cherokee

Nation, No. 23,199, the Eastern Cherokees, No. 23,2lH, and the Eastern

1 Ind. c1. Comm, 408   _ 416

-3and.Emigrant Cherokees, No. 23,212, which were consolidated and tried,

‘with the result that the Cherokee Nation on May 18, 1905, obtained a
judgment in the sun of $l.lll,28h.7O with interest, amounting in all
to $5,098,361.08. (See Cherokee Nation v. United States, U0 Ct. Cls.
252, 363-365: and Def. Ex. 2 as to amount of interest accrued on
judgment). The judgment included other items but this item was for
the sole benefit of the Eastern Cherokees and it is for the following
deductions made from this item that the plaintiffs are here complaining, namely:

1, The sun of $7U0,555.¥2 paid to plaintiffs‘ attorneys.

2. The sum of $lHS,2h5.l5 paid the attorneys of the Cherokee
Nation.

3. The sum of $l03,7H9.7H for the expense of ascertaining and .
identifying the persons entitled to the judgment fund and distributing it.

As to the first and second deductions, being those made for fees
paid attorneys for the Eastern Cherokees and attorneys for the Cherokee Nation, respectively, we have this day decided in the case,

Western (Old Settler) Cherokees v. United States, Docket No. U1, that.

those Indians may not recover attorneys‘ fees under facts quite
similar to those presented here, the only factual difference being
that in No, 51 the amount paid was fixed by contract, while here the
amount was fixed by the court, but in both cases the theory advanced

for recovery is the same. So, for the reasons set forth in No. Ml,

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 408

417

muwe must deny both of these claims.

There is an additional reason why the claim for the sun of
$lM8,2M5.l5 deducted from the judgment to pay the attorneys for the
Cherokee Nation, cannot be allowed and that is that the Eastern
Cherokees, in their case No. 23,2lU, petitioned the Court of Claims
to so construe its decree of May 18, 1905, that the judgment for the
benefit of the plaintiffs herein in said sun of $l,lll,28H.70 be not
chargeable with the fees of the attorneys for the Cherokee Nation.
All the parties, the United States, the Cherokee Nation, as well as
the petitioners, the Eastern Cherokees, nere represented at the hearing on the supplemental petition, and the Court of Claims determined
the matter against the Eastern Cherokees and dismissed the supplemental petition. (See Eastern Cherokees v. United States, H5 Ct.
Cls. 10h, affirmed by the Supreme Court, 225 U. s. 572, 56 L. ed.
1212). Thus, we see, there has been an adjudication on the merits.
We decided in Western (Old Settlers) Cherokees v. United states,
Docket No. 3. and Eastern (Emigrant) Cherokees, Docket No. 5, decided
November 15, 19U8, affirmed by Court of Claims (appeals Dockets Nos,
2 and 3, decided May 1, 1950, 116 0. 01s. ), that a claim
lonce litigated on the merits cannot be relitigated under clause (5),

which is the ground plaintiffs, in their brief, rely on here. The

rule in those cases applies here.

Exnense of Distributing Judgment Fund

 

' By the decree of the Court of Claims of May 18, 1905 (H0 C. Cls.

,,.__‘_-H‘; _.-...J-...'....an'...’l1 Ind. c1. Comm. 408 ' 418

-5363-365) there was awarded for the benefit of the Eastern Cherokees
"the sum of $1,111,2su.7o and interest, a total of $5,098,361.08,
which, after deducting attorneys‘ fees and the cost of determining
the persons entitled thereto and the costs of distribution, was
ordered distributed.per capita to the Eastern Cherokees. (See order
of May 28, 1906, Def. Ex. 1).
The orders of May 18, 1905, and.May 28, 1905, provided for the
distribution to be made by the Secretary of the Interior, but on
April 29, 1907, the Court of Claims in said case No. 23,2lU modified
its original orders by retaining jurisdiction of the distribution and
appointed one Guion Miller a special commissioner to prepare a roll of
the Eastern Cherokees entitled to share in the auard. The order also
provided that the expenses and costs of determining who were entitled
to the per capita payments should be borne by the judgment fund.
(See Ex. A. Appendix to Defendant‘s brief).
The order of April 29, 1907, was made pursuant to a petition on
behalf of the Eastern Cherokees in said No. 23,2lh, and letters of
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior.
(Exhibits D, C and B. appendix to Defendant's brief). There was
aecordingdy distributed to the Indians $H,105,8lO.53, and the costs
and expenses of ascertaining the distributees and paying them out of
the appropriation made to pay the judgment, was the sum of $lO3,7M9.7U.
It is because of the deduction of_this sun that plaintiffsare seeking

reimbursement here. The allegations of the petition concerning this

I Ind. C1. Comm. 408

419item are as follows:

"That although the Cherokee Nation was then in
existence, and as trustee for said Eastern Cherokees,

prosecuted such action to a successful conclusion, and
had efficient officers in sufficient numbers, and.
ample authority to distribute the remainder of the proceeds of such judgment, and were in the superior position of knowing what individuals were entitled to enjoy
the results thereof; that, nevertheless, the defendant

procured the appointment of one Guion_Mil1er, Esquire,

of the Baltimore, Maryland Bar, a total stranger to the

Eastern (Emigrant) Cherokees, as a Special Master, to

make such payment, at an expense to them of $lO3,7h9.7H."
It will be seen from the above allegations that the plaintiffs make

no charge that the expense of ascertaining the persons to when the

I

money appropriated to pay the judgment was to be paid, or of distrib~

1'‘ run“,
at uni"

uting the fund, was excessive or improper, or that the Special
nissioner acted to the disadvantage of the Indians. The real complaint
is that the Cherokee hation which obtained the judgment had efficient
officers in sufficient numbers and ample authority to make the distri~
bution, and should have been authorized to make it. Flaintiffs have
offered no proof whatever to support the above allegations. It is,
admitted by the defendant that Miller was appointed to make the distribution and the defendant‘s evidence shows (Def. Ex. 2) that the
sum of $lO3,7U9.7U was expended by the Special Commissioner in his
twork. In so far as anything appears to the contrary, the Special Commissioner performed his duties efficiently and, we may assume, with
the approval of the court. It is odd, to say the least, that after

petitioning the court to have the distribution made under its supervision, rather than that of the Secretary of the Interior, it should

now object. Be that as it may, we shall now pass on to the broader
question, which we suppose is involved in plaintiffs’ pleading.
namely, the propriety of charging the judgment fund with the cost
of determining the distributees and paying them.

At the outset, it will be remembered, the court decided (HO 0.
Cls, 327) that the judgment fund belonged to the Eastern Cherokees
ias communal owners, and accordingly, ordered it distributed per capita
to them. To make the required distribution it was necessary to determine the persons who belonged to that groups This determination
was for the sole benefit of the distributees; without it a distri— l
bution of the money would have been irpossible, so in directing and
supervising the handling of the fund the court took the only logical
course possible to insure payment to the individual Indians entitled
to the money. The Government derived no pecuniary benefit from the
fund, so how can it be said it should stand the expense of disbursing
tit. Even if the Government were considered an ordinary trustee, as
plaintiffs contend, it would have been entitled to be compensated
for the expenses of distribution. Not only that, when the Indians
petitioned the court to supervise the distribution of the fund they
must be presumed to have expected there would be costs which could
only be paid out of the judgment fund for the appropriation therefor
was only to pay the amount found due the Indians, plus interest to
date of payment. Acts of June 30, l906, 34 Stat. 63H, 66%, and

March U, 1909, 35 Stat. 907, 938.

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 408 ‘ 421-S~
The defendant, neither by treaty, agreement. nor act of Congress.
became obligated to pay the cost and expense of distributing the fund,
nor has it been the policy of the Government to bear such costs. Cf.
Choctaw Nation v. United States, 91 C:'Cls. 320. This item must,
therefore, be disalloweds
After the submission of this case plaintiffs filed a motion to
make "The Cherokee Nation” in additional party plaintiff. The view
we have taken of this claim makes the additional party unnecessary
because our conclusions will be the same if the Cherokee Nation had_
been a party from the bcginni.gs
For the reasons set forth above, plaintiffs’ poti ion must be

dismissed.
