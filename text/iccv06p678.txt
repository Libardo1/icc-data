OPINION O5 _I_ND_ OCNNISSION

6 678 J

O'Marr, Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Conrxission.

On March 25, 1958, the Indians of California, Dockets 31 and 37, the
Yokiah Tribe, Docket 176, Yana Tribe, Docket 215, Shasta Tribe, Docket 333,
and the Mission Bands, Docket 80, filed their joint motion to modify our
decision of January 20, 1958, so that the Indians of California "may continue to present and include the claims of Dockets Nos. 80, 176, 215 and
333, as claims of the Indians of California, in accordance with the stipulations between the petitioners" in all of the above numbered dockets.

On July 211, 1958, the Mission Indians, Docket no. 80, filed its
separateimotion to modify said decision of the Commission for the same
purpose.

The Government filed its objection to both motions on April 1;, 1958,
and August 13, 1958, respectively.

The two motions will be considered together.

On the 6th day of October, 1958, and at their request, we by order
merged the claims of the Yokiah, Yana and Shasta tribes with those of the
Indians of California for all purposes, including judgment. The Yokiah,
Yana and Shasta are, therefore, not interested in said joint motion for
they could not now be affected by any modification thereof if any were

made. So the only claimants now interested therein are the Mission Bands

and the Indians of California.

As to the Mission Bands, Docket 80, aside from the fact that we see
no reason for modifying our decision of January 20, 1958, 6 Ind. Cls. Com.
93-97, the lands claimed by those bands have by order of this day been

removed from the lands claimed by the Indians of California and they are

6 679

6 680

now empowered to prosecute their claims therefor without regard to their

i'stipu_'Lation with the Indians of California. This arrangement, we believe, is in best interests of the Mission Bands.
Orders overruling the joint motion of March 25', 1958, and the separate motion of the Mission Bands, filed on July 21:, 1958, will be enterei.
