July,.A. D. l855, with the Ottawas and Chippewas of Michigan,

for the selection of their lands.‘

And the said Chippwas of Saginaw and of Swan Creek and

Black River, shall have the'same exclusive right to enter
lands within the tracts withdrawn from sale for them for

five years after the time limited for selecting the lands to
which they are individually entitled, and the same right to

sell.and dispose of land entered by them, under the provisions

. of the Act of Congress known as the Graduation Act, and is

Pursuant to said Article 1, the Indians selected the followingdescribed lands in the County of Isabella: The north half of township
fourteen, and township fifteen and sixteen, north, of range three west,
the north half of township fourteen and township fifteen north, of range
four west, and townships fourteen and fifteen north of range five west.

%(Def. Ex. 12). This area became known as the Isabella Reservation, of’
which area 98,051.13 acres (the unsold part thereof) were available for
Indian selection and entry, and 160 acres for churches, school-houses
and educational purposes.

Of the land in the Saginaw Bay area, Townships l7 and 18 north,
ranges 3, 4 and 5 East in Michigan, the unsold part of which was made
available for Indian selection and entry, comprised 60,873.23 acres,
however, 280 acres thereof were apparently not released or relinquished

_by the 1864 treaty, hereafter to be referred to, so there were 60,593.23

acres thereof affected by the latter treaty. This area became known as

the Saginaw Reservation. (Def. Ex. 1).

3. By the treaty of August 2, 1855, it was provided that the
selections of land by individual Indians as therein provided should be
madegunder the same rules and regulations in every respect as provided
by the agreement "concluded by the United States on July 31, . 1855, with
the Ottawas and Chippewas of Michigan (11 Stat. 621; 2 Kapp. 725). Th£3€
rules and regulations are set out in Article 1 of said treaty and are

as follows:

**'k'k.'k

For the purpose.of-determining who may be entitled
to land under the provisions of this.article, lists
shall be prepared by the Indian agent, which lists shall
contain the names of all persons entitled, designating

---u--g-u..._......1p-n—u—o-—.g__. ..g-u.. ,,

them in four classes. Class lst, shall contain the
names of heads of families; class 2d,:Zthe names of
single persons over twenty-one years of age; class
3d, the names of orphan children over twenty-one
years of age, comprising families of two or more
persons, and class 4th, the names of single orphan
children under twenty-one years of age, and no

_ person shall be entered in more than one class.

Such lists shall be made and closed by the first

day of July, 1856, and thereafter no applications
for the benefits of this article will be allowed.

-At any time'within five years after the completion of the lists, selections of lands may be
made by the persons entitled thereto, and a notice
thereof, with a description of the land delected,
filed in the office of the Indian agent in Detroit,

‘to be by him.transmitted to the Office of Indian

Affairs at Washington City.

All selections of land under this article must
be made according to the usual subdivisions; and
fractional lots, if containing less than 60 acres,
may be regarded as forty-acre lots, if over sixty _
and less than one hundred and twenty acres, as
eighty-acre lots. Selections for orphan children
may be made by themselves or their friends, subject
to the approval of the agent.s

sAfter selections are made, as herein provided,
the persons entitled to the land may take immediate
possession thereof, and the United States will
thenceforth and until the issuing of patents as
hereinafter provided, hold the same in trust for
such persons, and certificates shall be issued, in
a suitable form, guaranteeing and securing to the
holders their possession and an ultimate title to
the land. But such certificates shall not be
assignable and shall contain a clause expressly

prohibiting the sale or transfer by the holder of
the land described therein.

After the expiration of ten years, such restriction
on the power of sale shall be withdrawn, and a patent
shall be issued in the usual form to each original holder
of a.certificate for the land described therein PROVIDED
That such restriction shall cease only upon the actual

issuing of the patent; AND PROVIDED FURTHER That the
President may in his discretion at any time in individual cases on the recommendation of the Indian agent
when it shall appear prudent and for the welfare of any
holder of a certificate, direct a patent to be issued.

AND PROVIDED ALSO, That after the expiration of ten years,
if individual cases shall be reported to the President by
the Indian agent, of persons who may then be incapable of
managing their own affairs from any reason whatever, he may
direct the patents in such cases to be withheld, and the
restrictions provided_by the certificate, continued so long
as he may deem necessary and proper. '

Should any of the heads of families die before the
issuing of the certificates or patents herein provided for,
the same shall issue to the heirs of such deceased persons.

All the land embraced within the tracts hereinbefore
described, that shall not have been appropriated or selected
within five years_shall remain the property of the United
States, and the same shall thereafter, for the further term
of five years, be subject to entry in the usual manner and
at the same rate per acre, as other adjacent public lands are
then held, by tQ- Indians only; and all lands, so purchased by
Indians, shall be sold without restriction, and certificates
and patents shall be issued for the same in the usual form
‘as in ordinary cases; and all lands remaining unappropriated ,
by or unsold to the Indians after the expiration of the lastmentioned term, may be sold or disposed of by the United States
as in the case of all other public lands.

Nothing contained herein shall be so construed as to
prevent the appropriation, by sale, gift, or otherwise, by
the United States, of any tract or tracts of land within the
aforesaid‘reservationsjfor3the£location of churches, schoolhouses, or for other~educational purposes, and for such

"purposes~purchases”ofLIand”may*likewise be made from the
Indians, the consent of the President of the United States,
a having, in every instance, first been obtained therefor.

It is also agreed that any lands within the aforesaid
,tracts now occupied hy.actual settlers, or by persons
ientitled'to pre-emption thereon,.shall be exempt from the
provisions of this article;.provided, that such pre-emption

H claims shall be proved, as prescribed by law, before the
lst day of October nert,'- I

Retyped

in in quantities depending upon their marital status, age, etc., fixed

by said treaty. (Art. 1).

5. Subsequent to the execution of the 1855 treaty, the Saginaw

became dissatisfied with the Saginaw Reservation area, so at the request

of the Saginaw, and with the encouragement of the representatives of the

United States, the Saginaws concluded a treaty with the United States on
October 18, 1864, (14 Stat. 657). This treaty was ratified by the Senate
of the United States on May 22, 1866 and proclaimed by the President on

August 16, 1866. By this treaty, the Saginaw released to the United States

the Saginaw Reservation land reserved to said tribe" by the treaty of

August 2, 1855, and relinquished to the United States "all claim to any

right they may possess to locate lands in lieu of the lands sold or disposed
of by the United States upon their reservation at Isabella, and also the
right to purchase the unselected lands in said reservation, as provided for
in the first article of said treaty." (Article l).l The area so released,
as shown by Finding 2 hereof, comprised 60,593.23 acres.
Article 2 of said treaty reads as follows:

In consideration of the foregoing relinquishments, the United States hereby agree to set apart
for the exclusive use, ownership, and occupancy of

’ the said of £hg_said Chippewas of Saginaw, Swan Creek,
and Black River, all of the unsold lands within the
six townships in Isabella County, reserved to said
Indians by the treaty of August 2, 1855, aforesaid,
and designated as follows, viz:

The north half of township fourteen, and townships fifteen and sixteen north, of range three west;
the north half of township fourteen and township
fifteen north, of range four west, and townships
fourteen and fifteen north, of range five west.

Article 3 of said treaty relinquished all selections made by

individual Indians who were granted the right to make selections of

\

land upon the Isabella Reservation in lieu of the selections made by

them in the Saginaw Reservation. It also provided for selections by Indian chiefs and head-men, and other members of the Saginaw; for selections
by certain.named persons, and by Ottawas, Chippewas and Pottawatomies then
belonging to the bands of which Metayomeig, May-me-she-gaw-day, Kech§kebeme-mo-say, and Waw-be-maweing-gun were chiefs.

"This article also provided for a list of all persons who had made
selections in the Saginaw Reservation under the treaty of August 2,Zl855,
and those who may be entitled to selections under the provisions of-the
treaty of I064. This treaty also provided for the expenditure of the sum‘
of $20,000 for the support and maintenance of a manual-labor school upon
the Isabella Reservation.

6. At the time the treaty of 1864 became effective there were
no lands within the Isabella Reservation subject to selection under the

1855 treaty, but by the provisions of the 1364 treaty all lands the

_Indians were entitled to select or purchase (entry) therein, which had

not been previously acquired by the Indians, became subject to selection
by individual members of the Saginaw, their chiefs and headmen, certain
namedtpersons, and by members of named bands of Ottawa, Chippewa, and

Pottawatomie Indians.

The evidence does not show the acreage in the Isabella Reservation

'that was made available for selection by members of the Saginaw under

the 1864 treaty. It does show, however, that of the total of 98,051.13’

acres assigned to the Indians therein, 2303,42 acres were selected by

individual Indians.under the l864 treaty. (Def. Ex. 1, pp. 2 and 18).

the Isabella Reservation under the 1864 treaty, does not definitely

appear, nor has the value of the rights or things the Saginaw acquired
under the treaty of 1864 been shown.

As to the value of the Saginaw rights_in.the Saginaw Reservation,
which the Saginaw relinquished by the 1864 treaty, the evidence mainly
relied upon by plaintiffs is the report of sales of tracts therein by
defendant subsequent to August 2, 1855, shown by defendant's Exhibitl,.
pp. 3 to 16. This exhibit covers only a part of the area relinquished,
that is, 43,025.82 acres of the 60,593.23 acres the Saginaw relinquished
by the 1864 treaty. The figure 60,593.23 includes 17,567.41 acres of
railroad grants made after the l8S5 treaty became effective and pursuant
to the Act of June 3, 1856, (ll Stat. 21). (Def. Ex.-1, pp. 2 and 17-18).

7. The treatyLof October 18, l864, was consummated by the United
States and twenty-eight chiefs and headmen of the Saginaw as their representatives. This treaty was made because the Saginaw Reservation lands
‘were unsuitable for the Indian use and because it was recognized by both
the Indians and government representatives that a removal of that part
(Def.

of the Saginaw located in said reserve would promote their welfare.

Exs. l4, 15, 17). The treaty as concluded, was with the authorized representatives of the Saginaw who fully understood its contents and voluntarily executed it and later approved amendments thereto. (Def. Exs. 1?,

l8, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,.24).
The Commission further finds that no fraud was practiced or in any
way involved in the negotiation or execution.of said treaty of l864.

the Indians under the treaties of 1855 and 1864, the plaintiff has
offered little evidence in support of its claim, but relies mainly
upon statements contained in a letter (C1. Ex. 2) written by the
Assistant Secretary of the Interior on February 21, 1935.

The evidence shows that whites, in devious ways, obtained timber
from Indian lands in the Isabella Reservation. Generally, this was
done through dealings with individual Indians who had made selections

under the treaties of 1855 and 1864. In other cases, the timber was

acquired from.Indian patentees. ‘But however or through whom the timber.

was taken, the record is devoid of any facts sufficient to determine

whether the plaintiff has a right to recover therefor. The proof

consists entirely of vague.and general statements as to time of taking,
quantity of timber tahen, or places from which taken.

Furthermore, there is no proof whatever that the failure of
defendant, as alleged in the petition, to issue allotment certificates
and patents resulted in loss or damage to plaintiff.

9. By the Congressional Act of September 28, 1850 (9 Stat. 519),
the United States-granted to the State of Michigan swamp lands within
thaf State, and pursuant to that Act, the State of Michigan, acting
through its proper authorities, selected 14,601.41 acres of swamp land

within the Isabella Reservation, and 14,829.43 acres of such lands

within the Saginaw Reservation. All of such selections were made prior

to the treaty of August 2, 1855, and approved by proper authorities of
the United States, although patents for all of such selections were not

delivered to the State of Michigan until after August 2, 1855. That by

the "so-called” Swamp Land Act of 1850 and the action of the State

"-"authorities pursuant thereto, all of the swamp land selected in the

"two reservations passed to the State of Michigan. Furthemore, none
of the lands so selected were wrongfully classified as such.

That by reason of said'Act of 1850 and the selections made thereunder, the rights thereto for selection or entry did not pass to the
Saginaw or its members under the provision of the treaty of August 2,
1855, and such lands were notincluded in the category of "unsold public
lands" within the areasof either the Isabella or saginaw reservations
referred to inarticle l of the treaty of 1855.
