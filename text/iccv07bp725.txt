The Cozmissicn rakes the following findings of fact which are supplemental to the findings ihtrsbered 1 to 20, inclusive, heretofore made herein:
 21. The Cornmiscsion has earlier in this case decided that petitioner
herein,  T}_u2~zamish ,“ held aboriginal “Indian title to certain’ lands
in what is not: the State of Washington which were ceded to the United States
by the Treaty of.‘ January 22, l8S§, l2 Stat. 927, and that the United States
 petitioner's Indian title to said lands on Iziarch 8 , l8S9,
the effective date of the treaty “(S Ind. Cl. Comm. ll'{). 2 The lauds found
to have been exclusively used and occupied by the D I-ramish Indians are set

out in said prior decision in Finding 2C. Said ‘lands uni." '1 hereinafter be

referred to as the subject tract or the Du‘.-.—'a.mish tract. This trial has been

held to deterzrzine the value of said lands as of Eéarch 8 , 18-59.
22. (a) The subject tract is an area of land l"ing be ‘seen Puget Sound
and Lake ‘z~2'ashington mostly south of Elliott Bag; and north of a line drawn.

east from Point Fully to just south of E-EcDonald Lake. The Duwamish tract

islocated in the northwestern portion of Yiing Count3', 1=Iash'ington, and consists of §1.',79C acres. The subject tract is aé_:~.pro::imately l3 "miles in its
greatest length north and south and ranges in 1-Iidth east and west two and a
half to fourteen miles. The southern portion of the Ihu-zamish tract is

 ‘by the Dut-zanish River and its tributary, Cedar River. The valley

of the Cedar River in its corcse through the tract is narrot: and rather deeply entrenched; the valley of the Du:-ramish is low and flat-bottomed 1;.-‘i
inadequate drainage, resulting in many marsh and swampy’ areas. About lLL,-"3

of the lands of the subject tract are located in these river vallegrs ard

the remainderof the tract is made up of a succession of rather steep, rounded
hills and ridges, with elevations -rising from sea level to UCC‘ feet. Much

214. The slowness of settlement of the Puget Sound area prior to the

D 4.

l88C‘s can be attributed to its physical"inacc'e'ss:I.‘oility and the lack of
transportation facilities. As of l85'9 all the comrrrunities of western WashI’
ington were mtualy dependent upon rarer transportation. There were few
roads and no railroads in the area. The construction of railroads west of
the Mississippi was delayed until sufficient funds were available, Which»-=

funds generally were derived from tke sale of lands granted the railroad.

The first transcontinental ra£ service was to California m l869. The

 Northern Pacific Railroad to the West Coast was completed in l883 and did

not reach the Puget Sound area until 1887.
-25. By Act of.‘Congress—the Territory of Oregon was established on

august 11.1,-1812.8 (9 Stat. 323). -L This territoryincluded the present States

by; tphep-{Act of Congress or March 2, 1853 (lO_Stat. 172) and included the

‘present States of I-{ashpington and Idaho. pp The Act of _I~iarch 3 , 1863 (12 Stat.

808) created the Territory of Idaho and established the eastern boundary of
the present State of Washington. On November-ll, 1889, Washington was admitted to the Union as astate. I

26. The first American settlers arriyed in the .‘Fuget Sound ‘area in
181:5, and in 1851 they established the frat Puget Sound town", T1:u.-Mater,
33001113 50 miles southwest of the Du*.:a.ni.sh tract. The first white settlers

in the subject tract arrived in 1551. In 1853 northern Thurston County became King County and the plat of the to‘;-zn of Seattle was filed. In l8S3

 

7 Illd. C10 00 1.2’...  

a special census listed l?C inhabitants in King County and the census of

1860 showed only 302 peo_le in King County. In l8§3 Henry L. Yesler built
a steam-powered sawmill on.the north shore of Elliott Bay. The population
of the town of Seattle in 1855 was said to be 50 people and following four

years of Indian trouble in the area it was reported there were twenty families

pin the town.

Timber

27. The Puget Sound area lies in a band of heavy timber which covers
uirtualby the entire area west of the Cascade Mountains. In fact, reports
indicate that nearly 9/l0ths of hashington's timber is in that area. The
Douglas fir forms about 7/Bths of the forest growth. There is also valuable
timber such as red cedar and hemlock. In l899, Henry Gannett, Chief of the
Division of Geography and Forestry for the Department of Interior, reported
that Smith the exception of the redwoods of California, the forests of washington are the densest, heaviest, and most continuous in the United States.

, Except for a few prairie openings, ard except where removed by fire or the

\

ai, they cover the country as a thick mantle from.high up on the Cascade
'Range westward to the shore of the Pacific.“ He reported on King County;

This county is in the middle of the State north and south,

and extends~from.the crest of the Cascade Range westward to

the shores of Puget Sound. Much of the eastern part of the
County lies high up in the Cascade Range, and contains little
ttimber of present merchantable value. Aside £rom.this and a

few trifling areas of prairie, the county was originally heavily
forested, but the forests have been largely removed by fire or
the ax.__Ihe latter has taken the timber from.Vashon.and Eaury islands, from the shores of Puget Sound, and.of lakes Washington
and Sammamish, and from a broad belt along the line of the
Northern Pacific Railroad, together with other smaller areas in
the interior of the county. Fires have done a vast amount of

damage in various parts of the county, mainly in its central

-I.

7 Ind. :31. com, 725 729

portion, although the mountainous regions have not been
neglected by it. Indeed, fully one-half of the area forme
erly covered with merchantable timber has been devastated
by fire.
28. In the subject tract there were approximately lh,COO board feet
of timber per acre, made up of the following species and amounts thereof:
Red Fir (Douglas) ........ 50%
 ouooooooooocoocooo 

Cedar ooocoooooooooooooooo 
Lesser Species ........... 15%

%29. In the early days of our colonial history, the forests were generally'regarded as inexhaustible and were in many instances considered a
liability rather than an asset, since many of the early settlers were interested in the use of the land for agriculture and razina ur oses and the

D -T.)
clearin of lands for those ourooses was a burdensome and ex ensive rocess.
- . P

That was the attitude of some of the early Oregonéwashington settlers where

tfires were started by them in the forests as an aid in clearing the land.

’Hetetet; there also existed a recognition of the need for timber for hones
and local industries as well as for shipbuilding and export. iFron.a commercial atiaaapaiat the imeerinaustry in this country had its beginning 
Maine, and geaduaiij eictended along the Atlantic seatoardana then into the
Great Lakes region.inel5§O. iLumbering oberations of any importance did

not reach the Oregonewashington area until about l89O to 1900 although ships
ments of timber began on Puget Sound around l8SO. The earliest commercial
uses made of the vast tinber resources were for spars and pilings. The

huge trees were cut by the settlers and dragged to the waters‘ edge to be
sold and loaded on ships for transportation to the world markets.

30. The first sawmill on Puget Sound was a small waterpower mill at a

t.. — .'.*
‘at’-?+~w«*'

 

7 ins. Cl. Comm. 725 730

site named Eea'Karket, now Tumwater, near the present city of Olgapia,
Washir ton. In September l8S2, there were three sawmills in operation in

what Became Washington Territory. Two years later there were thirty-three

sawmills in operation in Washington Territory. In l8SS there were twentyfour sawmills in the Puget Sound area. All the sawmills were constructed
along the waters of the Sound or on the banks of rivers whose waters could
be utilized in transporting the logs as well as providing power for the
saws. The first steam.plant sawmill was Yesler’s mill built in present
Seattle in the winter of l8S2—3. It had a capacity of 10,000 to lS,000
board feet per day and became the main industry in Seattle and for years
furnished employment for the local inhabitants. The mill in Seattle was
the only one in King County in 1860.

G
31. The early'lunbering operations were very crude. The logging was

done by manp aer. Trees were felled by ax, which was used until the early

l8t$0‘s when the cross-cut saw came into use. The trees were cut into logs

of a len¢th.which men could handle and were rolled or dragged to the

nearest water to be floated to a sawmill. Because of the laborious

S operation, the timber was cut slowly. The timber first cut was that along

the waters of the Sound and those streams which could.be used to drive
logs. Even as late as 1880 it was reported that the forests along the
shores of Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the lower Columbia
River had been culled only of the best trees for a distance of only one to
two miles inland. In the Department of Interior‘s Census Office Report

on the Forests of North America, by Charles S. Sargent (lB8h) it is re   

ported:

7 Ind. -33.. Com. 725 , 731

The methods adopted by the lumbermen of western Washington
territory are wasteful in the extreme. Loggers cut only timber
grotzing within a mile or a mile and a half of shores accessible
to good booming or shipping points or which 1.-rill yield not less
than 30,000 feet of lumber to the acre. Only trees are out
which will produce at least three logs 2L1 feet long, uith a
min5:'_:auIn diameter of 30 inches. Trees are out not less than l2
and often 20 feet from the ground, in order that the labor
cutting through the thick bark and enlarged base may be avoided,
while 140 or 50 feet of the top of the tree are entirely wasted.

 

32. In keeping with the early settlers‘ attitude ‘I; ward the liebility of seemingly inexhaustible forests  his desire to clear land, was
the feeling of the luznberman who cared little whether the timber he took legally belonged to him or not. Timber was cut indiscriminately from a neighbor‘s land, railroad land, or the public domain. It has been reported that

Puget Sound was the center of wholesale ti_mber stealing. In l86l measures

were taken to suppress this illegal activity and the areas‘ leading lumberq'men7from Port Gaznble, Port Madison, and ‘Seebeck (all lumbering centers on

0 the shores of the southern part of Puget Sound) were indicted. The usual

penaltylupoin a finding of guilty was payment for the land upon which the

timberlwas cut plus a. jail sentence of "an hour of jolly cozrununion" with

the court,“ theprosecution‘ and the defense.

5*‘ In an effort to prevent spoliation "of public timber a charge of 0 $2.50

a thousand was made for tiirber cut on government land. This “stumpage fee"

Since the land, if surveyed, could be offered for sale at $1.25 per acre.
An agent sent west during the Grant administration found that since l8S'S
on Puget Sound alone timber to the valuge of not less than $50, 000, 000 had

been stolen from the government. During this period a comnzon term in the

Pacific N rt west was “round forty.“ A.settler would acquire R0 to lé0 acres
of land; then he would out not only the timber on his own land but on the
surrounding land on all four sides. Before he was through cutting, he would
‘have cut from.l6C to 6&0 acres of timber from this government land in addition to his own b0 to 160 acres.
Agriculture

33. (a) The Duwamish tract contained some fertile land, mostlydalong

the river valleys which would need clearing. The productive soil accounted

for about lh% of the land. Most of the tract was so heavily timbered as to
prohibit clearing since the cost was estimated from $50.00 to $300.00 per
acre. I

‘(b) The 1860 census listed 366,156 acres in the Tslashirzgton Territory

 

as farmland. This compared with 2,060,539 acres of farmland in Oregon Territory. In l86C there were only 73 farms containing l2§89h acres in Kingf
County. iLess than 1% of the total'area of King County has listed as farm:

‘ land in the 1860 census. The early history of the entire'Washington Territor? and in particular the Puget $ound.area indicates that the use of land
for agricultural purposes was almost exclusively for the subsistehce of the
settlers. I 0 M 0

3h. (a) Under the Oregon Donation Act of Septemher 27, l850 (9 Stat.
H95) settlers were able to acquire a right to land in the Oregon Territoryg
which included.the present State or Washington. The Act originally provided
for grants of 320 acres to single, and 6&0 acres to married, elite settlers
Vho had settled.on.the land claimed prior to December 1. 1850. The Act required that the settlers live on the land.for four years, cultivate and improve

7 Ind. Cl. Com. 725 ' _ 733

it for their own use and not as agent for anyone else; that no town lots,
mineral lands or lands reserved for public purposes could be selected. The
act limited the donations to one person. Actual proof.‘ of a settler's conpliance with all the terms of the act was required before aipatent could
issue, and no patent could issue until the land was surveyed by the government surveyor.

(b)_ 1n l85l, 58 entries were made in the Washington Territory under
the Donation Act, and in l852 there were ll? entries. The Pgeemption Act
of September 14, l8hl, was made applicable to Washington in l851.1. Under the

35. (a) There is no evidence of any sales of'land comparable in size,
character or location to the Duwamish tract priar to l8S9. There were, however, several sales which were similar in certain.respects to the land ine
volved in this case. The Pope and Talbot firm, the Puget fHill Company, was
one of the early purchasers of tract of timger land. This company was one
of the largest sanmill companies with a mill at Port Gamble on the western.

side of the Sound. Under the Act creating the'washington Territory, two

,J"‘¢n

7 Ind. c1. Comm. 725   735

townships of.‘ land were allowed for financirg the University. The land could

be sold for not less than $1.30 per acre. Pope and Talbot were permi ted to

select the best of this University land and the records shot: purchases of
787.75 acres in 1861; 555.50 acres in 3.8623 and 17,150 acres in 1863, all at

a purchase price of 231.50 per acre. The land so purchased was choice, accessible timberland,‘ not more than a mile to a mile and a half from the

shoreline of the Sound and within the immediate vicinity of the Port. Gamble
mill. ‘Pope and Talbot also utilized military scrip to acquire 17,398

acres in 1863 but the exact price paid cannot be determined. The Puget
I-iill Company purchased 2 ,8h9.7S acres in Island County for about $1.05 per
acre in 1866. From 1875 through the 18805, Pope and Talbot purchased

numerous 160-acre tracts on a selective basis within a m&e and a half of

. salt I-iater at about 5.53 .12 per acre, with an occasiona. purchase slightly

above or belot-I this figure.

L  (.5) 'I'he first sale by the Northern Pacific Railroad Company was in

_December, 1872, when it sold 2h.69 acres north of Kalama on the Columbia

Rivmerpppat a price of  per acre. The first sale of more than-200, acres
was in  37 of l871L. That involved a tract of 590.36 acres onthe Hisquallfy
Plains which sold for $3.15 per acre. From July 1, 1383, until June 30,
1881:, the railroad sold a total of 11;? ,hS0.}.L9 acres in Washington for ~‘33h.70

36. The highest and best use for which the Duteamish lands were
adaptable as of Iviarch 8, 3.859, was timber production.

37. There were no mineral deposits of any i sportance known to be present on the Duwamish tract asof March 8, l8’,-39.

38. (a) Mr. James R. Crutchfield, a Professor of Economics at the
University of Washington, appeared as a witness for petitioner. This witness
testified that he used tvzo methods of evaluating the subject tract. The
first method he used to determine value was on the basis "of the actual commercial use which land might have and secondly he used a method to arrive
at a "subsistence valuation.“ C

Gib) l~‘Er. Crutchfield in his report states (Pet.'Ex. la) that he arrived at his estimate of value based on the actual commercial use which‘ the
land might have by following the procedure outlined  earlier cases. The

cases referred to by petitioner‘s witness are The Nooksack Trib°e v. United

 

 
   

States, 6 Ind. Cl. Co. e. 578, and I-iuckleshoot Tribe v. United States, 6. Ind.
Cl. Comm. 6C-8. In these prior determinations this Commission set: forth
fv-‘-iv in its pfindings of fact the methods used by the witness and in its
opinions stated Mr. Crutchfield‘s opinion of value could not be given much
weight since his method of valuation was not inaccordance with legally approved standards but rather involves methods based on conjecture and speculation, "which Irethods have been specifically rejected by‘ the courts and this
Commission." re‘. Crutch_field‘s opinion based on his "subsistence value"

method was rejected in these prior cases as being entirely theoretical and

7

as one not based upon any judicially accepted method of evaluating land.

his opinion as to value the ‘fair Irarket value approach. Defendant’s appraiser took into consideration the many factors considered in evaluating
lands such as the sizes of the tracts, accessibility, surrounding saes,
taxes, transportation, population, demand for land, markets, financial
investment, risks and need for a return on investment and profit. With
respect to the subject tract, Mr. Miller wrote:

- The Dut-zanish tract had certain recognized advantages

not common. to other areas in the Puget Sound region. The

tract is situate, on and around Elliott Bay, the best, and
best protected, deep water harbor on Puget Sound. Through

the tract flows the navigable Du:-ramish River 1-: .-ich, I-Ii oh
