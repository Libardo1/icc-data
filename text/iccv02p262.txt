WINION OF TE COLMISSION

 

PER CMJAM. The cause of action asserted in Docket Ho. 274 is on

 

behalf of the "Delaware Tribe of Indians,‘ also referred to as the “Delaware Nation.‘ The claim asserted is based on the alleged ownership of
lands in Kansas, ‘rcnottn as the “Outlet”; which lands are alleged to have
been guaranteed to the Delaware Nation by treaty of September 234, 1829
(7_ste.t. 329); and by a treaty of may 6, 1851: (10 Stat. 101:8) to have been
ceded to the defendant Government for an unconscionable consideration, by
reason whereof petitioner is entitled to recover.

Subsequent to the filing ‘or the petition in Docket Ne. 27...; there was
filed as Docket No. 21-Ll by the absentee Delaware .Tribe of Oklahoma‘, et al,
in behalf of the Delaware Nation, a claim for the value of the same lands
M11 by reason of the same facts.

The petitioners in both cases claim to be successors to, and assert
claim on behalf of, the Delaware Nation.

In View of the con.flic'ts by reason of the aforesaid, the defendant
filed I011 September 11:, 1951, n motion requesting the Commission to hold a
Preliminary hearing in the two doc!-net numbers on the questions: (a) whether
the respective petitioners, or either of them, are entitled to maintain the
aforesaid claim or claims; and (b) whether either of the petitioners is an
identifiable tribe, ,_band, or group within the meaning of Section 2 of the
Indian Claims Commission Act,  entitled to maintain the action asserted.
'.Ehe defendant i‘iled-motions to dimiss in both Dockets Nos. 27-A and 2141.

"333 Petitioners in both 27-41 and 21¥l filed a written consent to defendant's

introduced their evidence. On Harsh 31, 1952, a single hearing was held

in the two cases. At this time, with the consent of all parties, the
Comission ordered that the record show that ‘the evidence" taken in

either case may be considered as evidence in the other case;“ and, on

the defendant's motion, further ordered that the "record in Docket No.

274 is to be considered a part of the record in No. 231." Thereupon,
the petitioners in No. 21Ll and the defendant presented their evidence.
At the close of the hearing the Commission requested the parties in both
cases to file requests for findings of fact andbriefs. These requests
for findings of fact and briefs were thereafter filed, and the questions

raised were presented to the Commission in oral argument by attorneys for

both parties plaintiff and defendant.

- Q'_L1_e st ions Pre sented

l. Whether the petitioner in either case has the capacity to maintain
the present claim as a ‘tribe, band, or other identifiable group“ within the
meaning of the Indian Claims Cormnission Act.

2. Fhether or not the ptitioner in eithercase is entitled to maintain the claim asserted to the exclusion of the petitioner in the other.

The petitioner ‘in Docket No. 27-A claims to be the successor to and
the descendant of those Delawares who, following the treaty of September 21;,
1829 -- whereby the United States conveyed to the said Delaware Hation a
tract of land in Kansas — removed to said reservation so provided for them

in Kansas and remained there untill86'{; and who, following the agreement

_ _,._,...-_.__..--‘tn :...— .n.... ..o._.

of April 8, 1867, between the Cherokee Nation and the Delaware Tribe
of Indians, removed to the lands acquired under said agreement from the
Cherokeesin Indian Territory, where those so rmoving and their descendants continued to live  where they are at the present time.

. Thepetitioners in Docket 2141 claim to be an identifiable and
organized group of Indians and the descendants of those who refusedoto
Join those who became merged with the Cherokee Nation but who have continued to maintain a tribal existence, some of whom lived with the

Wichitas and Caddos and became attached ultimately to the Wichita Agency

around 1859 and now resideanong the Wichitas and Caddo Indians in western.
Oklahoma, and to have been recognized by the Department of ‘Interior as an
existing and functioning Band of Delaware Indians and to have been variously
Zcnowngas the Absentee Delawares, Southern Delawares, Delawares of Indian

Territory, and Absentee Delaware Tribe of Oklahoma.

*3ind.i.ng Ho. 8 of the Findings of Fact herein is to the effect that.
petitioner in Docket 27-A has at all times maintained identity as a_g'oup
and constitutes an identifiable group within the meaning of the Indian
Claims Commission Act. I

Finding No. 9 is to the effect that petitioners in Docket 2141 have
maintained group identity and constitute an identifiable group of _Delawere Indians within the meaning of the Indian Claims Commission Act.

It is undisputed that the main body of the Delawares and the group
with whom the defendant dealt as representing the Delaware Nation following the treaty of September 21%, 1829, removed to‘ the reservation
ceded to the Delawares in Kansas, and that following the ageement of

April 8, 1867, this group removed to the Cherokee Territory and its

did not result in the destruction of the continued activities of those
so incorporated with the Cherokees as a distinct identity. They continued to maintain their tribal customs, practices, and their hereditary form of Delaware government. They received annual payments for

many years from their own tribal funds, sepaate from the Cherokees.

They had separate tribal funds in the hands of the United States as
late as 1906. They were governed by hereditary tribal chiefs until
the death of Charles Journeycake in 1895. Thereafter they maintained
a. tribal council and business committee to perform the functions and
duties previously performed byltheir chiefs. This tribal council and
business comittee have continuously functioned as an identifiable group
as stated in Finding Ho. 8 until end at the present, time.
Notwithstanding the fact that the Delaware Indians previously residing on the Kansas reservation, and thereafter removing to the Indian
Territory upon lands purchased from the Cherokees, constituted a majority of the members of the Delaware Tribe or Nation and constituted the
group dealt with by the Government as representing the Nation subsequent
to the treaty of .1829, nevertheless there were Delaware Indians who were
recognized as members of the Delaware Ration or Tribe in 1829 and thereafter who did not remove to the Kansas reservation nor to the territory
acquired from the Cherokees. Many members of the Delaware Tribe, prior
to 1829 and thereafter, roamed over various portions of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, and became Lrnosm as Southern Delawares, and the descendants of these Indians now constitute the group who are petitioners

in Docket Do. 2141. ilhese Indians have also maintained a group identity
through the years and do so at the present time, as stated in Finding
No. 9.

That the Delawares onthe Kansas reservation who made the agreement

yrith the Cherokee Nation on the 8th day of April, A. D. 1867, did not

a consider themselves as constituting all members of the Delaware Nation

or Tribe is indicated by the provision in said agreement that the provisions of same should not belimited to those then registered (and only
residents of the Kansas reservation were at the time so registered), but
it provided that the beneficiaries thereof should consist of those then
registered ‘with such additions as may be made trithin_ one month of the
signing of this agreement."

_Die_question of whether or not the Delawares south of the Arkansas
River had maintained their membership in the Delaware Nation was raised
in 1858 by the Choctaws and Chickasaws withmhom they were living, and
with reference to their status Charles E._,lLiz, 5-cting Commission of
Indian Affairs in,the_ Department of _Interior, by letter dated Hay 10th,
1559. to Elias Rector, Superintendent of Indian Affairs at Fort Smith,
irkansas, stated that they were regarded as a port ion of their tribe
which resided in Kansas and that they had rights in commonjrith that
tribe, both as to land. and as’ to annuities, The Commissioner further
stated that the case" of Connor illustrated the connection of Delawares
not residing in Kansas with the said Delaware Nation as he (Connor)

became its principal chief by descent while he lived with the Delawares away frcm the Kansas reservation’ and south of the Arkansas.

0 .i 1.4 -'n..'...- ..'.b.uL4‘...By treaty of May 30th, 1360 (12 Stat. 1129) , which provided for
allotments to individual Indi.-«ms of lands previously set apart if or

their reservation in Kansas. Article 1!» recites that ‘Whereas "' " *

many oi’ the Delawares went down among the Southern Indians, and "' "' "‘

are still there, "' " "’ it is hereby agreed that eighty acres each be

‘set apart for then, to be allotted to them as they return, and certificates to be then issued to then, in the same manner as to those
now within the reservation, and in every respect to be governed by
the same rules and regulations "' ’ "."

That these who formed the Cheroicee-Delaware group be came a distinct identity notwithstanding the incorporation into the Cherokee
Tribe, but that they did not constitute the whole oi‘ the Delaware
Tribe or Ration is evidenced by the language of the Court of Claims

in the decision of that Court reported in the case of Journeycake v.

Cherokee Nation and The United States, 28 C, C, 281 (affirmed 155 U. S,

197). Statement is made in said opinion (13. 310) that '_'it is appaent

F
that the Delaseres retained their separate national fund of $889,191

in the Treasury of the United States as their separate property.‘ On

page 307 of that decision reference is made to the quantity of the

land being acquired by the Delavares as being an amount “fixed at and

limited to ‘one hundred and sixty acres of ‘land for each individual

of the Delaware Tribe‘; that is, ‘of the Delawares who elect to remove

to the ‘Indian Country “," — meaning the Cherokee Country - (underscoring slmplied). The obvious inference is that there might be

members Of the tribe the would not come to the Cherokee lands,

‘Ede opinion of the Supreme Court, by Mr. Justice Brewer, affirming the Journeyca‘-ce case, points out that the provisions of the
1867 contract involved ‘an absorption of individual Indians into the
Cherokee Nation” and contemplated ‘a personal selection of separate

tracts by individual Delasares.‘ (Page 205 — underscoring supplied).

 

Again quoting from this opinion (P. 2.13), "The  Delawares

took their homes in and remaining in the Cherokee reservation“; (underscoring aupplied) and, with reference to the retention of a portion of

the Delaware national fund, this was held to be for the_ benefit of
Delawares who might remove to: the Cherokee purchase, and other Delawares. with the language “that there was no certainty that all the
members of the Delaware Tribe would elect to removeto the Cherokee
country, and that those who remained in Kansas were entitled to their
share in the Delaware national funds.” While no reference is made to
Delawares who might be elsewhere remaining other than in Kansas - if
there were arm’ -- the proof introduced indicates that there were others,
to sit: the ancestors of those constituting petitioners in Docket No.
211,1. There is nothing in the record to show a loss of Delaware tribal
membership to any Delauares because of failure to remove to the Cherokee
territory.
mat those Delaware Indians who immigrated to the Cherokee territory, and their descendants, did not and do not constitute the whole

of the Delaware Nation is further evidenced by a later decision of

the Court of Claims and the Supreme Court, to wit, Delaware Indians

v. Cherokee Nation, 38 C. C. 231+, affirmed by the Supreme Cou.rt as

modified. 193 U. S. 127. In discussing the agreement of April 8, 1867,
made between the Delawares and the Cherokees, Judge Weldon in the Court
of Claims decision (13. 2145) uses this language, to wit: "There is a
class of Indians, perhaps very insignificant in numbers, who are not
provided for, and that is the Indian who was in being on the 8th of
‘April, 1867, and rho was not on the register roll,  who did not
within one month thereafter remove to the Indian country. As to such
Indians no provision is made, so that the classification becomes the
registered Indians and children born after said date to said registered Indians.‘ This language is certainly recognition of the fact
that those who became what might be called the Chero1~:ee--Delafzares
were not necessarily all the members of the then Delaware Ration or
Tribe.

As the injury, if any, complained of in'_Doc1:ets Hos. 27-3-1 and
Zhl was to the Delaware Nation or Tribe as it was constituted in_l829,
then as, stated in the opinion of the Court of Claims (Appeals Docket
No. 3.1!», Indian Claims Commission Docket 21), “any recovery for such
inJ‘J1'y (to the Cree}: Nation) should be for the benefit of all the
descendants of that nation." is neither the petitioner in Docket No.
27-A nor the petitioners in Docket Ho. 2341 can be called ‘the full.
successor“ to the Delaware Nation, so far as the treaties of 1829 and
185M are concerned, under the decision of the Court of Claims in the
above cited case neither group can be accorded the exclusive right to

prosecute the claim; but, as held in the said opinion, said causes of

action must be consolidated and any recovery for such injury must be

2 270

for thetbenefit of all the descendants of the Delaware Nat ion as
constituted in 1829 and 1851+. e

Eherefore. in keeping with this opinion and the findings of
fact, it is the conclusion_o£ the Commission that the motions of the

defendant to dismiss in each ofthe cases, Docket No. 27-1. and Doclmt

- ‘Ho. 2141, should be overruled, and the motions to consolidate the

cases should be granted. It is so ordered.

The Commission will hear counsel as to the form of the order

or orders to be entered in accordance with the above decision.
