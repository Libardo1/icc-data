treaty, and at the same time the Huron band.relinquished any interest it
‘might have in the permanent annuity provided for by the Greenville treaty.
The United States recognized the exclusive interest asserted.by the Huron
band to the 1805 treaty payment.

EVIUEECE

See evidence cited.under Finding 31. See also, Pet.
 EX:   EX. I“1Sl,  Into Ebco 

33. The Detroit treaty of 1807 provided for the payment of a
permanent annuity of $h0O to the Huron band exclusively. The annuity
was paid to the Huron band in Michigan until it was commuted for the
sum of $8,000 and that sum, appropriated under the act of Jun 29,

1888 (25 Stat. 225), was paid to the members of the Huron band.

EVIDEHCE

 

As noted above under Finding 31, the treaty provided
for the payment of $1,666.66 to the "Pottawatamie nation."
In 1808 this sum was divided, half being paid at Detroit
to the Huron band, the other half being paid at Chicago
to other Potawatomi, who cannot be identified from the
present record. The permanent annuity, however, was all
paid at Detroit to the Huron.band (Int. Ex. I-150 and
I:153). The Huron band still claimed this annuity after
the‘westward.removal of the other Potawatomi bands (Def.
Ex. 29) and the Government continued.to list it as one of
the annuities payable in the Michigan Superintendency
(Def. Ex. 89). After the l8h6 treaty with the Potawatomi
Nation, this annuity was separately appropriated for the
Huron.band (See Finding 28 and evidence cited). Payment
under the 1888 appropriation was made in 1889 (Int. Ex.

 0
3h. In accordance with a provision of the 186? treaty referred to
above in Finding 29, a commission.was appointed by the President to

investigate a claim that the obligations of the United States under

various Potawatomi treaties had not been carried out in full. This
commission studied all of the Potawatomi treaties between 1795 and
18h6 and computed the obligations of the United States through the year

l86l. The Commission reported 3l?8,953.h3 due under the stipulations
of treaties which had not been fulfilled, after deducting overpayments
made under some treaties. Of Unis total, the sum of $5,000 was reported
to be due and.unpaid under the treaty of July h, 1805, and the sum of
$h,h0O was reported to be due and unpaid under the treaty of November 17,
1807c By the Act of March 2, 1889 225 Stat. 988) Congress appropriated

the total sum.so reported and directed payment out of that sum of

s $9,h00 to the Potawatomi of Huron, and payment of the balance in the

proportions stated in Finding 29 above to the Citizen Band and the Prairie

Band, Payment of $9,h00 plus interest was made to the Huron bands
EVIDENCE

See "Recapitulation" in report of the President's com»
mission, p. 30 of'House Ex. Doc. 61, h0th Cong., 3rd Sess.
(Int. Ex. I-62); and Int. EX. I~72. Note that the l8OS
and 180? treaties are identified in the report cited by

their proclamation dates, April 2h, 1806 and Jan. 2?,
l808, respectively . ’

35} The claim of the Pokagon band to a “just proportion of all
annuities" pursuant to the special provision of the 1833 treaty re»
ferred to above in Finding 22, as presented to Congress and eventually
to the Court of Claims, and as determined.by the Court of Claims
(Pbtawatomie Indians v. U. 3., 27 0. Cls. hO3), did not include a

Share in the permanent annuity of the Huron.band under the 180? treaty,

h L99

but included shares in all the permanent annuities and all the short
term annuities continuing beyond 1833 under the treaties with the other
four Potawatomi bands.

EVIDENCE

- Proceedings of the President‘s commission, cited in
Finding 3h, involved treaty obligations going back to
1795. The claim of the Pokagon band involved obligations
subsequent to l833 and consequently were limited to permanent annuities or short term obligations continuing beyond 1833. This excluded the Fort Industry treaty of

July h, l8OS, but included the 1807 treaty. All treaties
under which annuities had not yet expired, except the

1807 treaty, were included in the reports of Congressional
Committees considering the Pokagon band claim (Sen. Rept.
No. lll, 38th,Cong., 2nd Sess., Def. Ex. 36 and Int. Ex.
I-61; House Rept. E0. 19, 38th Cong., lst Sess., Int. Ex.
I-60); in the petitions filed in the Court of Claims (Int.
Ex. I-73 and I-Yb); and in the decision 55 the Court of

Claims (27 C. Cls. hO3.) See particularly the Court's
Finding VIII.

36. The claim of the Wisconsin Indians, presented in a memorial

to Congress in 1902, of a right to share in the annuities paid to the

negotiated September 27, 1833, the United States made some payments
to the Pokagon band.3 However, the band claimed that it had not received all the payments to which it was entitled. In 1866, an agreement was reached.between the Pokagon band and the Potawatomi Nation,
with the approval of the United States, whereby the claim of the
Pokagon band was settled for the sum of $39,COO. Payment of this

challenged the adequacy of the settlement, but expressly disclaimed any
interest in treaties made with the United States subsequent to 1833.

The memorial stated: "By the treaty dated September 27, 1833, these

Indians became separate peoples, with distinct, separate rights, by the

n3. Bythe Act of March 19, 1890 (26 Stat. 2n), jurisdiction was

vested in the Court of Claims to determine the claims of the "Pottawatomie

Indians of Michigan and Indiana," or the group which has been.referred

to herein as the Pokagon band. The act provided that the payment referred

to above in Finding bl, was not to constitute an estoppel.
Under this Act, two groups of Indians in Michigan filed petitions
in the Court of Claims. One petition (Court of Claims No. l67h3) alleged

a claim to a pro rate payment under all treaties with Potawatomi bands,

8 other than the Huron band, which provided for annuities extending beyond

l833.

This included.a.claim to a pro rata share in a permanent annuity
Of $300, which the United States had agreed to pay under the l8h6 treaty
‘with the Potawatomi Nation, in lieu of certain goods and services provided
for under a treaty made September 20, 1828.

The other petition (Court of Claims No. l68h2) alleged the same claim,
and in addition alleged a.claim to a pro rata share of the monies paid by

the United.States to the Potawatomi Nation for the lands in Iowa and

Kansas ceded in l8h6.

Neither of the petitions alleged a claim to any proportion of the

permanent annuity payable to the Huron band.

Intervenors' Exhibits I-73 and I-74, being copies of
petitions in Court of Claims cases Nos. 16743 and l6842,
respectively, of which the Commission takes judicial notice.

44. The two petitions were consolidated for trial. The
court found that the number of Indians authorized by the treaty
of September 27, 1833, to receive ehares of annuities in Michigan
was 250. The court found that other Potawatomi iedians had remained in Michigan Territory who were not beneficiaries of the
special provision of the treaty made September 2?, 1833. The
court was unable to identify the Indians who had rights under
that provision.

The court allowed a recovery based upon its findings of the
proportion the number of lodiahs eutgorieed to remain in Michigan
bore to the number of indians who had removed west. making an
average of the variations in population which occurred throughout

the years during which payments were not made to the Pokagoo band

or were insufficient.

45. The court‘s allowance was based on all the treaties made
with the Potawatomi bands, other then the Heron hand. through
1833. It did not include any port of the mooiee payable to the
Potawatomi Nation under the 1846 treaty, but it did include in its
allowance the proportionate ehare of the enema} payment of $300
which by the 1846 treaty was to be made in lieu of the goods and
services provided for under the treaty of Septemhcr 20. 1828 (7

Stat. 317).

h6. The court held that the non-emigrating Indians who were not
1embers of the Pokagon'band had no rights. ‘With respect to the Pokagon
)and the court declared:

". . . Under the terms of this supplement a portion severed
its connection.with the united nation, and thereby lost its
identity with the Pottawatomies as a tribe, in order that
it might avail itself of the privilege of remaining in the
Territory of Michigan. In.ceasing to be a part of the united
nation, it did not retain any part of the political or corporate poser of the tribe, that was undivided and still inherent in the body'which.emigrated.beyond the Mississippi
pursuant to the terms and requirements of‘the treaty. The
portion remaining may have acquired a right to share in the
annuities, but the corporate power of the tribe remained
intact and incident to the larger body which emigrated."

Some of them went to live with the Menominee tribe in Wisconsin.

EVIDENCE

 

In 1837, it was reported by Schoolcraft that about 300
members of the United Nation, "disinclined to emigrate" had
gone north (Def. Ex. 86). In 1842, it was reported that,
as of 1840 a number remained who "manifested an unwillingness
to emigrate at that time“ (Int. Ex. I~3l . These were "a
remnant of the United Nation... about two hundred and fifty
in number" (Int. Ex. I-29). Some of these Indians attempted
to join the Menominee tribe in northern Eisconsin (Def. Ex.
96 and Int. Ex. I~36). In 1870, the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs reported to the Secretary of the Interior, with reference to "stray bands" of Potawatoni in Wisconsin:

"These bands are remnants of their tribes
that were removed years ago to the nest of the
‘Mississippi River, andiconprise those who
avoided the efforts of the government to remove them, or those who refused to accompany
their tribe, and some who, after being removed,
returned to their old home. it is vnderstood

Dr. Wallace testified as to customs of the Fotawatoni
during the period 1795 — l8é6 with which he was dealing
(Tr. 946-9&7, 951-952, 955~956).

Congress recognized this common practice when in the
Act of June 25, 1864, 13 Stat. 161. 1?2, if referred to

annuities to which stray bands of Potawatomi and Winnebagoes
in Wisconsin “would be entitled if they were settled upon
their reservations with their respective tribes . . .“

Persons who left the Prairie Band in Kansas and went
to‘Wisconsin gave up their membership in that band and
were denied the rights of members both by the Band and
the Government. They were reinstated as members only
by action of the Prairie Band Council. See, in Pet.

S3. iAt various times subsequent to 186h Congress continued to
authorize payment to the Citizen Band and the Prairie Band of funds due
to the Potawatomi Nation under various treaties including the 1833 and
l8h6 treaties. Pursuant to the 1861 treaty referred to above in Finding
29, between the years 1870 and 1875 Congress authorized payment to the
members of the Citizen Band, per capita, of that Band's pro rata share
of the funds of the Potawatomi Nation held by the United States and of
the capital ualue of the permanent annuities payable under the various
treaties made originally with the four bands who were united to form the
Potawatomi Nation in 18h6.

Congress continued to appropriate .:E‘or the Prairie Band its pro rata
share of the permanent annuities until the annuities were capitalized
and.commuted as set out below in Finding Sh. In addition, Congress continued to appropriate for the Prairie Band the interest on the capital
funds of the Potawatomi Nation retained in the Treasury for the Prairie
Band after payment to the members of the Citizen Band of their pro rata

share of such funds.

negotiations were held with members of the Prairie Band whereby it was

agreed that they be paid, per capita, the capital value of the annuities
then being paid to the band. I

By Act of April n, 1910, 36 Stat. 269, 288-289, the sum of $187,058
was appropriated for payment to the members of the Prairie Band in
accordance with that agreement. I

55. In 1902, Indians in Wisconsin claiming Potawatomi descent
asserted a right to share in the annuities and funds of the Potawatomi
Nation. This claim was rejected by the Commissioner of Indian.Affairs.
Some months later the Indians presented a memorial to Congress assert»
ing rights under the various treaties with the Potawatomi bands and
requesting relief. By the Act of June 21, 1906, 3h Stat. 380, the
Secretary of Interior was directed to investigate the claims and to
make an enrollment of the Indians.

56. Acting under the 1906 statute the Secretary of the Interior
caused to be enrolled hS7 Indians in Wisconsin, each of whom claimed
at least one ancestor, on either side, having Potawatomi blood, and
who were not enrolled.with any tribe then receiving benefits from the
United States. In addition, the Secretary caused to be enrolled

1,550 Indians in Canada, who claimed at least one ancestor with Potawatomi blood, regardless whether or not these Indians were enrolled

Retyped

with groups recognized by the Canadian Government. The ancestors of the

Indians so enrolled included Menominee, Winnebago, Chippewa and Ottawa

Indians.

The agent who prepared this roll for the Government, Walter M. Wooster,

excluded those Indians whose Potawatomi ancestors resided in southern Wisconsin or Michigan. He also excluded Indians whose ancestors had removed

west of the Mississippi.

EVIDENCE

 

Wooster explained in his report:

"In order to be enrolled a claimant was required to proved
satisfactorily (1) that he or one of his ancestors was a
member of the Wisconsin Pottawatomie tribe or hand at the
time of the making of the treaty of 1833, but did not move
west of the Mississippi River, as required by that treaty,
and consequently did not receive any of the benefits accruing thereunder; and (2) that neither he nor the ancestor
through whom he claimed was or had been enrolled with any
other tribe or band in the United States.

"A large number of applicants were examined who, by their
own admission, were clearly shown to be without Pottawatomie
blood. They were refused enrollment and told why. In many
cases where Wisconsin Pottawatomies descent was claimed a
searching inquiry disclosed that their ancestors, while
Pottawatomies, belonged in southern Wisconsin or to the
Michigan branch known as Pohgon's bank oi Pottawatonies.
They also were rejected.“ /Epuse Doc. 830, 60th_Cong.,

lst Sess., at p. 14. Def. Ex. 41; Int. Ex. I-83]

The Indians enrolled in Canada included those receiving
"full rights as Canadian Indians" and those receiving no
benefits from the Canadian Government (Id., pp. l?~2l).

Wooster was instructed by the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs to adopt the Churchill roll made the preceding year
(Pet. (71-A) Ex. A-56). That roll had 414 names. Churchill
reported that these Wisconsin Potawatomi were intermarried
with Menominee, Winnebago, Chippewa and Ottawa (Churchill
to Hitchcock, Nov. 10, 1906, part of Pet. (?l«A) Ex. A~57).

Writing to one of the Indians on whom he was relying for
help, Wooster stated:

"Of course, you are aware that no Indians or
descendants of any Indian are desired where the
ancestor came from southern Wisconsin or Michigan.
Only those who are related to the band or tribe of
indians who participated in the treaty of 1833to which you belong - are to be included." £Eooster

57. Commencing with the Act of June 30, l9l3, 38 Stat. 77,

Congress made a series of appropriations for the benefit of the
