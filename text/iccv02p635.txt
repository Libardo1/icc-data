Witt, chief Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission

The Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, also known as the Miami Tribe, petitioners
in Docket No. 67, seek to recover from the defendant additional compensation
for lands ceded by the Miami Nation to the United States by treaty of
October 6, 1818 (7 Stat. 189) the said lands which are designated on Royce's

Map of Indiana as Area 99 and consists of approximately 7,036,000 acres in

By reason of<overLepping;.and conflicting claims asserted by petitioner

in other docket numbers, the Commission by order dated January 5, 1953,
consolidated Docket No. 124 which was being asserted on behalf of the

Miami Tribe by Miamis of Indiana with Docket No. 67; and by the same

order consolidated with Docket Do. 67 for the limited purpose of

determining the title of the Wea and Delaware Indians, if any, to any

part of Area 99, Docket 314 asserting claims on behalf of the Weas and

‘Docket 337 asserting claims on behalf of the Delawares. Thereafter,

by reason of claims being asserted which might be construed as conflicting with claims asserted by claimants in Docket Nos. 67, 124, 314

and 337, by order of the Commission dated March 2, 1953, leave was grant

"to the petitioners.in Dockets Nos. l5-D, 29-3 and 311 (Potawatomi); and

in Docket 89 by the Six Nations, and in Docket 315 by the Kickapoos to
intervene in Docket No. 67 (consolidated) for the limited purpose of
asserting on behalf of the respective petitioners in said docket numbers
any and all claims of any right, title or interest in or to Area 99 or
any part thereof. Said order provided that the failure of any of said
petitioners to file a motion for leave to intervene on or before March 24,
1953, should constitute and be deemed to be a disclaimer of such petitioners
so failing to file within said time of any claim.of right, title or interest
in or to Area 99 or any.part thereof. 3 A A

V Petitions of intervention were filed by all of said petitioners so
granted the right to do so except petitioners in Docket No. 29-3. Said

petitions of intervention so filed disclaimed an interest in Area 99

or agreed that their rights should be determined upon the evidence

introduced by other parties.

On March 31, 1953 the pommission made an order and set said consolidated and intervening causes for final hearing as to limited issues
for April 21, 1953 and thereafter on April 21, 1953, an order was made
with reference to the issues to be submitted and upon which evidence
was to be introduced, said order being agreed upon by all parties, reading as follows:

This cause coming on to be heard pursuant to order heretofore
entered herein on March 31, 1953, and it appearing to the Com‘ mission that said order should be modified as hereinafter pro7 vided, and the parties_having agreed in open hearing on this

Tribe or Nation pursuant to treaty of October 6, l8l8 (7 Stat.
189) to the extent that such title was recognized by the United
States as existing in any Indian tribes or nations at or about

' 2. The right of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma and the individual
petitioners named in Docket No. 67, or any of them, to institute
and maintain a claim under the Indian Claims Comission Act

3. Submission of the aforesaid issues shall not prejudice:

1. She right of any of the parties, including the intervenors

a claim under the Indian Claims Commission Act arising out of

and in connection with said cession by the Miami Tribe or
Nation.

C. All parties, including the intervenors and the defendant,
shall be permitted to file proposed findings of fact and briefs
on the two issues set forth in Paragraph A of this order, as
provided in the rules of procedure of this Commission.

Evidence was thereafter concluded on the two issues thus submitted to the
Commission, to-wit:

1.6

Indian title to Area 99 to the extent that such title was
recognized by the United States as existing in any Indian
tribe or nation at or about the date of the cessions of
October 6, 1818;

2. The right of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma and the individual

petitioners named in Docket No. 67 by any of them to insist
and maintain a claim.under the Indian Claims Comission Act

arising out of and in connection with the cession made by
the treaty of October 6, l8l8.

It should be noted that said order of the Commission of April ii, 195
;provided that the submission of the issue of recognized title only did not
‘prejudice any party from a subsequent submission of evidence on the issue

of Indian title to Area 99 or any part of which.whose Indian title there’ to had not been found to have been so recognized_by the United States;

nor wss'the submission of such limited issues to affectbtie rights of

petitioners in Docket E0. l24 whose right to insist and maintain a claim

under the Indian Claims Commission Act arising out of and in connection

with said cession of October 6, 1818, was not to be determined by said

\

submission. I ' i

In the brief filed herein by the defendant the issue as to the right
of petitioners in Docket E0. 67 to bring the action is eliminated by
statement that it no longer controverts the same; therefore, one sole

issue is presented for determination and decision, which is this:

What tribe or tribes of Indians had Indian title, recognized or acknowledged
by the United States in Area 99 (Royce‘s Map of Indiana) on the 6th day
of October, 1818? (Def. Brief, pp. 3, 9, 40).

Petitioners in Dockets 67, 124, 314 and 337 assert that they held,
recognized, or acknowledged Indian title to said Area 99 by reason
(among others) of the treaty of August 21, 1805 (7 Stat. 91), the treaty
of September 30, 1809 (7 Stat. ll3), the supplemental treaty of September
30, 1809 (7 Stat. IIS); and by reason of various writings and reports of
W. Henry Harrison, Treaty Commissioner in 1805 and l809, and a letter

tten by Lewis Cass (Pet. Ex. 35) one of the Treaty Commissioners, to
the Secretary of War on October 23, 1826.

.It is the contention of the defendant that the language of Article 4
of the treaty of 1805 upon which petitioners rely for recognition of title
was intended solely as an assurance that the Miamis, the Eel Rivers and
Weas would be considered as one nation and no dealings would be had with
any one tribe as to whatever lands they held in.common without the consent of each tribe. The fact that the land involved is not definitely
described but is referred to as "the country on the Wabash and its
waters above the'Vineennes tract" and covers such a vast unsurveyed and

indefinite area is urged to convince that title thereto in the Indians

‘was not intended to be recognized.

Statements made by Governor Harrison upon which petitioners rely

are construed by the defendant to only have the purpose of assuring that

the tribes would be recognized as joint owners of whatever lands they

might own in common and were not intended as evidencing any recognition

of said ownership.

Recognition of Indian title may be formally expressed in a treaty;

it may_be derived from the necessary implications of a treaty; it may be

‘found in a statute; it may appear in pronouncements and conduct of

1

responsible government officials.

Lengthy discussions of whether or not a treaty provision constituted

‘a recognition of Indian ownership is found in the decisions of Fort

Berthold Indians.v. United States, 71 C. Cls. 308, and Assiniboine Indian

Tribe v. United States, 77 C. Cls. 347. These cases involve the construction of the Treaty of Fort Laramie of September 17, 1851 (11 Stat.
749). It was contended by the Government that Wthe territorial provisions
(of the treaty) were simply mutual recognition by the Indians of their
claims to territory and its segregation by them, without positive governmental recognition or verification of th

same." The treaty involved :

vast domain--that claimed by the Fort Berthold Indians embracing close to
13 million acres and that by the Assiniboines approximately 6% million
acres. -The.treaty was held in each case to acknowledge Indian title in

the claimant Indians. No appeal was taken in the Fort Berthold case;

certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court in the Assiniboine case. WithF

out going into the facts involved in these decisions, we think they support

the contention of petitioners herein that the language of the treaty
and the acts and statements of government officials at the time and

thereafter evidence a recognition that the Miami, Eel and'Wea tribes

were the owners of the land involved at the time of the treaty.
As stated in the Republic of China case, 30 F. 2d, 278, 279,

"Recognition is not necessarily expressed; it may be implied * * *.”

The language of the treaty relied upon by the petitioners as constituting a recognition of the ownership of same by petitioners is found

in.Article 4 of the treaty of August 21, 1805 (7 Stat. 91), which article

reads as follows:

ARI. IV. As the tribes which are now called the Miamis,
Eel River, and Weas, were formerly and still consider themselves as one nation, and as they have determined that neither
of these tribes shall dispose of any part of the country which
they hold in common; in order to quiet their minds on that head,
the United States do hereby engage to consider them as joint
owners of all the country on the Wabash and its waters, above the
Vincennes tract, and which has not been ceded to the United
States, by this or any former treaty; and they do farther engage
that they will not purchase any part of the said country, without
the consent of each of said tribes, Provided always, That nothing
in this section contained, shall in any manner weaken or destroy
any claim which the Kickapoos, who are not represented in this

treaty may have to the country they now occupy on the Vermillion
river. . '

The defendant contends that the area, to-wit: "the country on the Wabash
and its waters, above the Vincennes trac*"‘was “too vast, indefinite and"

unsurveyed9 to warrant the contention that Indian title thereto was intended to be recognized.

I

In the treaty of Prairie du Chien, August 19, 1825 (l Stat. 272)
boundaries were fixed among a number of tribes, among them the Menominies,
although the representatives of thelnenominies were "not sufficiently
acquaintedVwith their proper boundaries to settle the same indefinitely."
However, in Beecher v; Weatherby, 95 U. S. 517, the Supreme Court referred
to the "land thus recognized as belonging to the Menominee tribe." In
‘Minnesota V. Hitchcock, 185 U. S. 373, in discussing the situation'wherein
a reservation was held to have been created, the court said with reference

to the language involved as follows: "Now, in order to create a reservation,

. an. _—n.- nu..- .-—u-.-._ .I_. -,

‘Iv.

. a . . ~ _ ‘ ‘ I

it is not necessary that there should be a formal cession or a formal’

act setting apart a particular trac__t." In Spaulding v. Chandler, 160

U. S. 394, a treaty reserving to a tribe an undefined "place of encampment * * * convenient to the fishing ground" was held to have been
sufficiently definite when coupled with proof of the land actually

occupied to create a reservation.

That the territory-involved had been long prior to the treaty of

1818 regarded as Miami territory is evidenced by the fact that Little

Turtle, the Miami Chief, during the negotiations resulting in the
Greenville Treaty of 1795, referred to this land in Indiana and Ohio

as "country which has been enjoyed by my forefathers since time immemorial." He also described the boundaries of a large tract of land,
including all of Indiana, much of Ohio and part of Illinois as "the

boundaries of the Miami Nation."

0

By the Greenville Treaty of August 3, 1795 (7 Stat. 49) the Miami

Tribe and other tribes ceded lands in Ohio and southern and eastern
Indiana and these cessions were confirmed by'the Fort Wayne Treaty of

f .
June 7, 1803 (7 Stat. 74), by the treaty of September 30, 1809 (7 Stat.

-113) and the Grouseland Treaty of August 21, 1805, and finally by the

treaty of October 6, l8l8. Finally by the treaty of October 23, 1826

(7 Stat. 300), the Miami Tribe ceded all ts lands north of the Wabash

River.

These several treaties are cited to confirm.our viewpoint that when

the language of Article 4 which says that the United States considered

the tribes therein named "as joint owners of the country on the Wabash

and its waters" that said language was intended to mean exactly what it
said, that is, that the tribes mentioned were recognized as the joint

owners of the land referred to.

Governor Harrison, who negotiated the treaty of August 21, l805 in
which the above statement is made, in reporting to the Secretary of War
on that treaty, declared, "the guarantee of those lands to the three
tribes, who call themselves Miamies, could_not be avoided, as they
insisted upon it with the most persevering obstinacy. but, I conceive
that it will be no difficult matter to get them, in the course of a few
years, to make a division of the land that they now hold in common."
(Emphasis supplied). I

isubsequent negotiations_and transactions show dealings\with these
tribes in keeping with a recognition of their joint ownership of these
lands on the Wabash and its waters. In the negotiations at Eort Wayne,
which resulted in the treaty of September 30, 1809, attended by the
Miamies (including the Eel Rivers, the Pottawatomies and the Delawares
but not the Weas), the Miami Chief refused to discuss the sale of certain
lands in Western Indiana, stating "the land you want on the Wabash, we
have nothing to say at present as the'Weas are not here.” That the Weas
and Miamies had divided their territory is reflected in the l809 treaty-the treaty ceding Royce's Area.Nos. 71 and 72, both areas within the

country on the Wabash and on its waters as referred to in the 1805 Grouseland treaty. . The conclusion is inescapable that the Weas and Miami Tribes, after

August 21, l805, divided the lands on the Wabash and its waters which

_ previously they had possessed in common and that the Government by the

nature of its negotiations and the treaties made, acknowledged this

division and the ownership of the lands in keeping with the recognition

and acknowledgement made in the Grouseland treaty.

The maps in evidence of territory involved show conclusively that

Area 99, which is involved herein, was located in the country recognized

i'as "on the Wabash and its waters" as mentioned in Article 4 of the treaty

In-fact, by a stipulation later withdrawn, the defendant admitte

"this; and after withdrawing said stipulation did not deny the fact of the

said location of said Area 99.

The extent of the Weas' country (a portion of 99) consists of 8l5,00C

acres and the Weas' ownership of said acreage as outlined in blue int:

duced on the map as Ex. 109 is a ‘tted by the petitioners in Docket No.

It is stipulated that Area 99 contains 7,036,000 acres; and it is agreed between
petitioners, Miamis, Hess and Delawares that the‘Weas are entitled to
815,000 acres in the western part of Area 99 and that the Delaware Tribe
had a one-half interest in 3,859,000 acres in the southern part of Area
99, being the country watered by the'White River, and that the Miamis,
petitioners in Docket No. 67, had title to the remainder of Area 99.
There is no evidence in the record to support the ownership of the

petitioners or any of them.in Dockets l5-D, 29-3, 311 or 315 in Area

99, or any part thereof, at or about the time of the cession of October 6,

1818. Such of the intervening petitions as do not disclaim any interest

in Area 99 submit the rights in that respect upon the evidence introdi

by others.

Since the order of April 21, l953 does not submit the determination
of the'rights of petitioners in Docket No. 124 to maintain a claim arising out of and in connection with the cession of the Miami Tribe or
Nation on October 6, l8l8, no determination of said petitioners’ rights
in that respect is made at this time, and the holding that the petitioners
in Docket 67-are entitled to bring the action they have, is not to be
construed as a finding that they have the exclusive right to do so or
that the petitioners in Docket 124 are precluded from asserting a claim
based on said cession of October 6, 1818.

In keeping with the above, an order will be entered decreeing that
the petitioners in Docket No. 67 are entitled to institute and maintain
a claim under the Indian Claims Commission Act, arising out of the

cession made by the Miami Tribe on October 6, 1818, and that the United

States recognize the exclusive title of the Miami Tribe to the lands
ceded by the treaty of October 6, 1818, being Area 99 according to Royce’s
Map of Indiana, subject only to recognized interest in the Delaware and

the“Wea Tribes as found by Finding of Fact 4; and that none of the intervenors had any right, title or interest in the acreage involved at or

about the time of the cession of October 6, l8l8.
