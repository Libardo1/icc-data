OPINION ON DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO
ENTER ADJUSTMENTS IN VALUATION AWARD

Vance, Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.
The defendant has moved that the Commission enter an order adjusting
the gross valuation award made by the Commission July 15, 1976, 38 Ind.

Cl. Comm. 469,'532. In that decision the Commission determined that the
fair market value of the lands obtained from the Sioux by the United
States under the Treaty of April 29, 1868, 15 Stat. 635, was $45,685,000;
broken down to $20,895,000 for lands east of the Missouri River, and

$24,790,000 for lands west of the Missouri. Defendant asserts that the

award for lands west of the Missouri should be subject to three reductions,

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 208 209

as follows: 1) A 7 percent reduction to account for the fact that the
Teton Sioux owned/only a 93 percent interest in the lands ceded west

of the Missouri.— This reduction would amount to $1,735,300. 2) An
additional reduction representing an increase of 7 percent in the
plaintiffs‘ ownership of the land inside the Great Sioux Reservation.§]
This reduction would amount to $1,351,033. 3) A final reduction representing the value of lands not previously owned by the plaintiffs which were
included in the Great Sioux Reservation. This reduction would equal
$1,417,988. For the reasons indicated below we grant in part, and deny

in part, defendant's motion.

1. This Commission has determined that under the Fort Laramie
Treaty of September 17, 1851, the Teton Sioux received an undivided
93 percent interest in the Sioux Fort Laramie lands, and the Yankton
Sioux received an undivided 7 percent interest in those lands. 24 Ind.
C1. Comm. 147 (1970), as modified_by_41 Ind. C1. Comm. 160 (1977).
Under the 1868 treaty the United States acquired from the Tetons their
interest in that portion of the Sioux Fort Laramie lands outside of the

Great Sioux Reservation. In our valuation decision we determined the

full fair market value of those lands. Since the Teton Sioux, represented
by the plaintiffs in this docket, owned only a 93 percent interest in

those lands it is necessary to reduce the valuation by 7 percent to

reflect the actual value of what was acquired by the United States.

ff Defendant's motion requested actual reduction of 17 percent, based
on earlier Commission determinations that the Teton Sioux ownership of

land west of the Missouri was 83 percent. Subsequent to the filing of
defendant's motion, the Commission held that Teton ownership was actually

93 percent. See 41 Ind. C1. Comm. 160 (1977). we have treated defendant's
motion as modified to reflect the recent Commission ruling.

42 Ind. Cl. Com. 203 210

The plaintiffs, however, contend that they should receive credit for
the full value of the lands acquired by the United States. Plaintiffs‘
assertion basically is that,after the Yankton Sioux ceded whatever interest
they had in the Sioux Fort Laramie lands in 1858, the Tetons became the
sole owners in physical control of the Sioux Fort Laramie lands, and thus
owners of a 100 percent interest. Further, plaintiffs argue, in 1868,
when the United States negotiated with the plaintiffs, the Government
treated them as if they were owners of 100 percent of the land rather
than a fraction of it. We are unable to accept plaintiffs‘ contention.

In the past, when the Comission has confronted the situation in
which more than one tribe possessed interests in recognized title lands,
we have always awarded each tribe a gross award equivalent to its
proportionate interest in the total value of the lands. We know of no
instance (and plaintiffs have cited none) in which the Commission has
determined that a tribe's fractional interest ripened to 100 percent when
the co—owning tribe ceded its respective interest in the recognized title
lands. Were we to accept plaintiffs‘ contention, the last tribe to cede
its interest in a recognized title area would always possess a 100 percent
interest in the land.

The absurdity of the plaintiffs‘ position is demonstrated by examining
what would have happened if the Tetons, rather than the Yanktons, had
been the first to cede their interest in the Fort Laramie lands. Under

plaintiffs‘ theory, when the Tetons ceded their interest the Yanktons

would become the sole owners in physical control of the land, and their

42 Ind. Cl. Com. 208 211

7 percent interest would abruptly increase to 100 percent. The mere
recital of this hypothetical situation demonstrates the invalidity of
plaintiffs’ position. We shall therefore grant the first part of
defendant's motion.

2. The second and third reductions requested by the defendant,
although represented as adjustments to the value of the ceded lands, are
actually claims for offset of payments on the claim. Defendant is really
claiming that under the 1868 treaty plaintiffs‘ ownership interest in the
Great Sioux Reservation was increased, that this increase amounted to
treaty consideration, and that defendant should receive credit for this
increase. When viewed this way, we must deny both of these claimed
reductions.

In a companion decision the Comission has described the history
behind, and the negotiations leading up to the 1868 treaty. It is clear
from this history, and the negotiations, that the Sioux viewed the
establishment of the reservation as a setting aside of a portion of their
own lands, from which all non-Indians would be forever barred and upon

which those Sioux who agreed to become farmers would do so. It is equally

clear that the Sioux viewed the entire reservation as already belonging

to them; and that they could not have understood that they were receiving
an additional property interest in the reservation from the Government.

In this respect this case is indistinguishable from Nez Perce Tribe v.

United States, Docket 175, 24 Ind. Cl. Comm. 429 (1971). Since the

Sioux did not bargain for and agree to this increase of their property

right in the Great Sioux Reservation, the increase cannot constitute

'43 Ind. c1. Comm. 203 212

consideration flowing from the United States to the Sioux. Therefore, it
cannot be offset as a payment on the claim.
We shall enter an order granting in part, and denying in part,

defendant's motion.
