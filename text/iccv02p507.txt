SIGN

 

, Chief Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.
In an opinion rendered in this Docket on March 31, 1953, the Commission found that the petitioner should recover $554,589.85 upon the

claim asserted by it in its Third Sense of Action, and $624,468.55 upon
the clsims set forth in its Fourth Cause of Actions It was ordered th.’.—s as o'Loki.al recovery of $1,179,058.40 should be reduced sy such offsets, if
say, so might later be found allowable.

In its Amended Answer the defesdart claims credit for a group of

expenditures sade solely for th- benefit of the plaintiff and also a

percentage of eight separate groups of exyeeditores made jointly for

2 507

2 508

the plaintiff and various other Indian tribes. The plaintiff has not
questioned the amount of any expenditure or the population ratio between the plaintiff and the other tribes benefited by the joint expenditures but does deny that certain types of expenditures are available
as offsets under the limitations of 60 Stat. 1049, and says that the
treaties of l8l7, 1825, l830, 1833, 1836 and 1854 morally obligated defendant to do and perform many things not enumerated or set out therein,
and that many of the claimed offsets are expenditures made in compliance
with such obligations and so, being for the satisfaction of an obligation owing, cannot be considered as credits or offsets. The plaintiff
does not spell out any inferred obligation within any one of the enumerated treaties.

Plaintiff also contends that for want of fair and honorable
dealings the defendant should be denied the right to any offsets whatsoever because while it handled the tribal funds of the plaintiff it caused
more than $152,290.71 of those funds to be expended for items which 60
Stat. lOé9 expressly eliminates from offsets allowable to the defendant
when they have been paid from public funds. It is not charged that such
expenditures were not proper expenditures of trust funds under the terms
of the trust agreement. Plaintiff thus recognizes and seeks to avoid
the effect of Sioux Tribe vs. United States ll2 C. Cls. 50.

3e do not believe that the course of transactions between the
plaintiff and defendant over the long period involved in this litigation has been such that the defendant has forfeited the right to

plaintiff herein any crcdits'not falling within the classifications
prohibited by 60 Stat. lO49, known as the Indian Claims Commission Act.
We conclude that there are three types of expenditures which may
be involved in hese Indian cases. First: Annuity payments which may
be in money or articles, payable direet or otherwise, according to the
provisions of the treaty or contract. Second: Gratuitous expenditures
of public funds for purposes for which there exists no treaty or contracts l obligation. lnird: Trust fund disbursements, or expenditures

of funds held in trust and subject to the authorization of the trust

agreement, express or implied. No accounting is sought for trust funds or annuitj payments accruing under the clear wording of the treaties and

agreements between the parties. We are asked, however, to consider each

because it is contended the nature of the items are such that they are
prohibited as offsets by section 2 of 60 Stat. 1049. There are in all
eight types of items thus in dispute, together with several charges for
transporting those items or supplies used in connection with them.
we believe that these can be most briefly and conveniently discussed if they are broken down according to the item and the period of

time withie which it was furnished, and this we have done as follows:

The report E the General Accounting Office discloses that $18.00 was

scent £0: surveying in 1891 and that in 1937 65 cents was paid for trans- .g::.:

porting surveyxcg sugplies of which 65 cents petitioner received bene-1ts of

statute the sum of $979.37. -ae item of $18.00, being survey costs

incurred in 1891, is part of those expenses assumed by the petitioner

and snould have been paid from the "Removal Fund." To correct the

erroneous charge, defendant is entitled to offset that sum.

we conclude the 16 can: charge made in 1937 is too far removed in

to have been within the consideration of the parties.

is an item advanced by defendant 33 years after the passage of 33 Stat.

189, directing distribution of all Otoe and Missouria funds in the

any program of survey among the Indians in 1937. It will be denied

as an agency or administrative expense.

cigtsred by sections 4 of 19 Stat. 208 and 21 Stat. 380 (Finding 26).

arose after July 1, l927. Since the work of such an agent is intruction in the domestic arts and for the education of adults, and
the item was incurred after termination of the plaintiff's assumption
of cest of beneficial expenses, it must be denied be reason of the
prohibition in 60 Stat. 1049.
Pay of Interpreter
The retention of an interpreter has been considered an item of
administrative expense. Seminole Nation v. United States, 102 C. Cls.
565. There is nothing in the evidence justifying a different interpretation in this case. The pay of interpreters may not be offset.

Transportation of Su lies for

     

ricultural Aid
The nature of the items transported as supplies for agricultural
aid is such that they were useful to the Indian population rather than
in the administration of an agency, and their immediate purpose would
be the material benefit of the Indians as distinguished from an educational intent. As such the charges for transporting gratuitous

supplies are allowable as offset credits. The oral testimony presented,

however, disclosed that the greater portion of a $920.82 item included

2 511

in the total $1,040.53 charged for transporting_supplies for agricultural

aid represents the cost of delivering merchandise purchased for the Indians

with their annuity money arising_under the treaty of 1854 and according to

the provisions of that treaty. The treaty specified payment of a specific

sum; it authorized payment directly to the Indians or the-expenditure of

all or part in their behalf.‘ Having expanded the annuity payment as

directed, the obligation of the government was met. To-require it to

also pay the cost_of transporting the purchases would increase the amount

of its expenditure beyond the amount of annuity payment called ior
under the treaty. In the absence of an agreement to also transport
the merchandise so purchased, which is lacking here, we conclude

payment of transportation is a Gratuity, which the defendant may

offset. Credit of $1,040.53 will be allowed.

Traescortatioa of Miscellaneous Brildin? uaterial.

      

The Haired States paid $1ll,98 for transporting miscellaneous

building material. This was not reported as agency expense by the

Agents to the Otoe aad‘Missouria Indians, who were most likely to
know the true use made of the material transported, and upon whose

resorts we must rely in the absence of other evidence. Similar

T71.

charges were offset in Qtapaw rcibe vs. Enited States, Docket 14.

-"'f'rge $111.98 will be allowed as an offset here. $11.50 of this arose

in 1893, and should have been charged against the tribal interest

fund as an assumed benericial expense.

in summation, we fiad the defendant, the United States, may
