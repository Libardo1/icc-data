under the contracts between the tribe and the ‘attorneys the charges

for legal services were limited to ten per cent of the first three
million dollars of recovery and not to exceed 8 per cent on all over
three million dollars. Claim is made for $ho7,h22.2h, thezmaximum
allowance that can be made under the contracts approved by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.

In the preparation and presentation of the case much research was
required and facts assembled of an historical character and for that
purpose and to obtain the testimony of witnesses to testify to the same,
the attorneys for petitioner engaged the services of a member of the
faculty of Gonzaga University of Spokane, Washington, and for the use of
its facilities and a member of the faculty, the attorneys for petitioner

‘eed with said University to‘ pay it out of the attorneys‘ fee allowed
a sum equal to 7% of such fee.

Taking into consideration the services performed by the attorneys,
the contingent character of the fee and the fact that the payment for
the services rendered by Gonzaga University must be deducted, we are of

the opinion the attorneys should beallowed the sum of $h07,).L22.2h, less

the sum of $28,519.55 Payable to said University, or a net sum of
$378,902.69.

Kenneth R. L. Simmons was the original attorney for the tribal claimant under a contract with the tribe, dated December 16, 19b9, and finally

approved by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs on April 12, l9SO.

performed legal services for the tribe in the presentation and prosecution

of the claim until his ‘death on April 13, 1953- During his handling 05

6 685

the case he was associated with and assisted by other attorneys; he and

his associates also spent several months negotiating for a settlement

which never materialized. Up to the time of Mr. Simmons‘ death the proof

had been made on the title phase of the case, but it was not until after

his death that the briefing was done and an interlocutory determination

of liability entered in 1955. Of course, after the determination of

liability an extended hearing was had on the question of value, etc.
Counsel have asked us to determine the value of Mr. Simmons’ services up to the time of his death and have offered proof to the effect
A-.  I
that on ~August- 13, 1953, when he died, the services rendered by all the

attorneys engaged in the work, including the deceased, entitled them to
a payment equal to one-third of the fee finally fixed for legal services

in the case. Taking into consideration such proof and our knowledge of

the progress of the case, the proposed division of the fee appeals to us
as very fair. However, as we have previously held, we have no jurisdiction to divide fees among the attorneys. See Shoshone v. United States,
6 Ind. Cls. Comm. 636; Chickasaw Nation v. United States, 121 c. Cls. 1:1.
He can only determine the total fee leaving the interested parties to apportion the fee in accordance with their agreements therefor.
Reimbursable Expenses - Attorneys

The expenses usually connected with litigation such as this have in
this case been advanced from time to time during the pendency of the case
by the tribe. However, the tribal funds available for such purposes were

exhausted and it became necessary for counsel for the petitioner to advance

money for expenses of the litigation in order to complete it.

Kenneth R. 1.. Simmons during his lifetime advanced for such expenses

 

the sum of $614.99 which we allow in full. It was approved by the Tribal
Council and must be paid to his heirs and distributees.

R. G. Wiggenhorn, between July 1, 1957, and July 29, 1957, eifpendai

 

for expenses of the case $319.82. Included in the items were two charges
of $1.00 each for travel insurance. We consider such items personal to
the attorney and are disallowed, reducing the claim to $317.82. fir. Wiggenhorn has submitted another claim for expenses during the period from
December 6, 1957, to May 8, l9S8, in the sum of $3112.89 which is allowed
in full. His claim for the period from May 26, 1953, to September 7, 1958,
is for $162. 26. There was erroneously included in this claim $61.81;
which had been previously paid by the Indian Service so the claim is reauced to $100.12.

These three claims were approved by the Tribal Council on May 10,
19585 and are allowed in the aggregate sum of $761.13.

Wilkinson: Cragun and Barker has submitted three claims for expenses
advanced or incurred in the prosecution of the case, which win be considered separately.

A claim in the amount of $lOO9.1;8 is submitted for expenses incurred
in the case during the period June l, 1957, to April 12, l9S8. This sum
included one-half of $3. 75 for a meal for Mr. 1-.-‘iggenhorn, which he was
compensated for separately, so the sum of $1.87 is deducted, leaving a
balance Of $1007.61, which is allowedo

Another claim in the amount of $3,LL25.86 for expenses of the litiition advanced by counsel during the period June 25, l953, to iay 28, 1957,

is submitted. Of this sum the attorneys have voluntarily withdrawn the
sum of $9.17 for meals for Jones and Murray in June , l9S6. Taxi fares
for a member of the firm from his office to his home, aggregating $3.50

and travel insurance of $.62 are items included in the claim. We consider
such items either personal to the attorney or office expenseswhich should
not be charged to the tribe. Nor do we think the charge of $3.39 for
Sunday meals on March 211, l9S7,a proper charge since they were for attorneys working at their office in Washington, D. C.. Another item included in the claim is $32.05 for lithographing a "Digest of Indian

Claims Commission Cases." and

This in our opinion is an office expense
should not be considered a reasonable expense in the prosecution of the

claim. These items total $h8.'?3 and are excluded, thereby reducing the

claim to $3377.13, which is allowed.

The third claim is for $6hl.95 for expenses of litigation paid between April 8 and August 7 , 1958. This claim includes taxi fares aggregating $7.50 for employees doing might work in May, 1958. We believe
such items should be considered office expensesand borne by the employer.
we, therefore, deduct the sum of $7.50 and allow the claim in the sum of

35631;. 145.

All of the above claims, except the last, were approved by the Tribal

Council.

Witness Fees

 

The attorneys for the tribe employed Henry T. I-iurray, as an expert
aPpI‘aiser, to value the lands involved and agreed to pay him total compensation for the work the sum of $35,000.00 in case of recovery. There is

£"‘?lu|’

due him under his contract the sum cf'$20,000.00. ‘We consider the

charge reasonable and it is accordingly allowed.
The attorneys also employed Fred 0. Jones, as an expert appraiser;
to value the mineral lands involved in the case and they agreed to pay

him in the event of recovery the sum of $25,000.00 over and above his

actual expenses. .According to the evidence there is now due him the

Sum Of $l9,765.h0 under his contract. ‘We consider the charge reasonable and it is therefore allowed.

The claims of Murray and Jones were approved by resolution of the
Coeur dtélene Tribal Council on May 12, 1958.

Dr. Alfred'W. Bowers, an anthropologist and archeologist of the

“niversity of Idaho, did.much research in connection with the case and

testified as a witness. we consider the charge reasonable and it is

allowed in the sum of $1,000.00.

'William.B. Osborne, Jr. and Harriet Cooley Osborne, as heirs at law
of William B. Osborne, deceased, have presented a claim in the sum of
$7,150.00 for services rendered.by their father. .According to the proof,
‘William B. Osborne was a Consulting Forester by profession and was engaged by attorneys for the tribe totmake an investigation of and testify

concerning the value of the timber land resources of the area involved

in the case. There appears to have been no definite agreement as to

compensation but Mr. Osborne apparently did some work on the case and was

paid all his expenses while examining the lands, except $50.00. There is

no satisfactory proof as to the kind of services rendered or the time

gent intmaking an investigation of the lands or the character of the

6 689

information assembled. At any rate, Mr. Osborne became incapacitated

by illness on August lh, l95h, and died on October 28, 195k. No report

of his work had ever been submitted to counsel and he never testified
in the case. Counsel for the tribe suggest a payment of $1250.00, which

the Government considers tootmuch. ‘We are of the opinion that under the

circumstances an allowance of $1250.00 should be made. The heirs also

claim.$50.00 for expenses which were not repaid deceased. These outlays

are described only as "out-of-pocket expense." Obviously, such a description is too indefinite to consider. Such claims Should be itemized

to show character of'the charges and.time expended. we must therefore

disallow the $50.00 item.‘

On June 17, 1952, william.B. Osborne submitted a voucher for payment

of expenses in the case. This voucher included an item of $11.95 for

"l Radiant Electric Heater (required to heat'wonking quarters on Saturdays, Sundays and Hollidays)." The date of the charge is December 5,
1951, and was apparently paid. Such an item is not a proper charge

against the tribe and is therefore deducted.from the amount of $1250.00

allowed, reducing that allowance to $1238.05.

‘We have previously mentioned the Gonzaga University claim. It is in
the amount of $28,519.55, which has been deducted from the amount allowed

for attorneys‘ fees. That amount is therefore allowed as a claim.and

should be deducted from the award and paid to that University.
