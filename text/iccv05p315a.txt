(1) That Finding 28 he stricken and there shall be set forth.in lieu
thereof:

During the fiscal years l9LS through 1956 (G.R.0. Report, Def. EX.
26, pp. 3, h, 6, 7 and Def. Ex. 30) there was expended for the relief of
needy Indians of the petitioner tribes the aggregate sum of $396,8Lh.96.
These disbursements'nere made from.appropriations for the health, welfare,
support or rehabilitation of needy Indians, generally, throughout the
United States. The disbursements were made to individual members of the
petitioner tribes on the basis of indigidnal needs only aft r an investigation by social workers employed by defendant. To be eligible for the
cash payments it was necessary for the recipient to show his need.for the
payments. The ap_ropriations out of which the payments were made appear
-1CQ C

at page l8? of defendant's said Eyhibit 27 and defendant’s said Exhioio 30.

In none of the acts from which the disoersenents were made'was it
required that the tribes of'nhich the recipients were members reimburse
the defendant for such outlays, nor is there any proof that the petitioner

-2(2) That Finding 30 be stricken and there shall be set forth in lieu
thereof:

Under appropriations for the “support of Apaches, Kiowa, Comanches
and Wichitas“ at the Kiowa Agency, Oklahoma, there was disbursed.for
barbed wire and staples for fencing land the foll wing sums in the fiscal
y ars: 1901, 32068111; 1902, 552116.06; 1°05-1908, $393.05, a total sum
of $L877.52. '

The only proof offered is that shown.by defendant's Exhibit 26, pages
39, El, L6, L8, 53 and 56, being pages from the G.A.O. Report, which is
to the effect that wire and staples were received at the agency and.that
there was disbursed from the appropriations referred to above the amounts
stated. No proof has been.offered of the distri *tion of such items or

that they were used for tribal benefit. The total claimed is denied as an
offset.

thereof: '

_ sum of $1966.99 for “seeds, fruit trees and fertilizer for indigent Indians“

of the Kiowa Agency, and expenditures of that exact sum were made from the
appropriation act of June 28, 19hl (p. 186, G.A.O. Report, Def. 1. 27)

for the “support and.reha ilitation of needy Indians." In a separate and
later G.A.0. Report (Def. V:. 26, p. 32) the same item.uas broken down and
shown to cover $15.99 for paper bags for issuing seed to Indians, and $1951
for vegetable seed. ‘While this later report listed the amount under
"agricultural aid,“ it is obvious that it was expended.for the support of
needy Indians since the amounts were disbursed from the appropriation.act
for such Indians. The amount is denied as an offset.

(L) That Finding 32 be stricken and there shall be set forth in lieu
thereof: a

At pages 15 and 39-61 of defendant's Exhibit 26 there appears disbursements aggregating $7,0ll.L2 for agricultural implements and equipment.
The evidence shows that agricultural implements and equipment were sold
to Indians of the Kiowa Agency after June 30, 1003, on credit, and that
during the fiscal year 1901 the sum of $1601.25 and during the fiscal year
1902 the sum of $652.29 were disbursed for such items, and there is no

evidence that such items were distributed.to the Indians of the Kiowa Agency,

but the evidence does show that duri.g the period 1901 to 1910 the agency
conducted extensive fern operations for agency purposes, and that schools

operated under the agency administration conducted farm operations. It is
therefore impossible to determine from the evidence what the implements and

run

ecuipnent were used for or b" whom.it was received. ihe amount claimed is

‘J
D
denied as an offset.

(5) That Findin. 39 be stricken and there shall be set forth in li-u
thereof:

a e 16, C~.A.0, Report, Def. ‘R. 26, is shown the sum of $85,329.};7
expended f r provisions purchased between the fiscal years l90l and l9l0,

and $1179.60 expended for provisions purchased in the years 1930-36, l9}_r0,

<'=‘- ‘EOJC-al Of $86,509.07. Disbursement schedu...es covering said sum show that
the disbursernents were made from appropriations for the “subsistence and
civilization of Apaches, Kicsas, Comanches and 7r:”ichitas,“ but no proof has
been offered of the distribution of provisions to the tribe or any of its
members, in fact, Indian witnesses have testilied that no rations were
issued Indians of the Kiowa Agency after their.‘ lands were allotted by May 31,

- 1901.

It is further shown by the evidence that of thetotal of 703,000 pounds
of beef purchased in I901, 29,090 pounds were used by agency schools and that
Indian employees of the agency received rations as part of their pay but no
account of the amount of such rations is shown by the evidence, nor is there
any proof shown that provisions purchased during said period were used for
tribal benefit. The amount is therefore denied as an offset.

\

{5} T..at 39(a} be added:

39 (3.). at page 81 of the G..5...0. Report, Defendant‘s Exhibit 26, appears
an item of 331468.21; a ’crea:do=;-.-'n of the amount sh us t.e followirg disbursements: $63 for slaughtering catt...e in l902; $578.12 for food in l°09, and
$2820.16 for food in l9l0. (See pages ll2, l20 and I22 of the Cr.A.0. Report,
Def. Ezxz. 26, llisbursement Schedules.l9 and 20, respectively). The caption
of each disbursement schedule shows the disbursements therein listed were
made from appropriations for the "support of Apaches, Kiowa, Ccrnanches and
‘-'-Iichitas.” A report of the Gemral Accountinf-,' Office (Tr., p. 1288) testified: “Section B is shipped to the agency and there is nothing; to Show it
was given to the Indians." The two disbursement schedules mentioned above
are in Section B of part III of said report and the invoice or voucher for
the purchases merely indicates a purchase for the Kicz-Ia Agency as distinguished from purchases for "Indians," as appears in Section A of Part III
of said report. Iio proof has been offered shot-ring istribution of the supplies
to the Indians of petitioner tribes, and in so far-as anythizzg appears to th
contrary they may have been aco_ui“ed for agency or school uses. The auo=.::1t is
denied as an offset.

(8) That Finding L7 is amended.to read:

Defendant claims offsets in the total amount of $8,757-53 for ‘transportation of goods and materials to the Iiio;-sa Agency. Since the sums
expended for items under the headings "Clothing“; "Hardware, Glass, O'_‘=_'L
and Paints“; “Household Equipment and Supplies”; “Buildings“; "hills and
Shops," and “Surveying and Allotting” have been denied as proper offsets,
the sums emended in transportation of such articles or items for use
under such headings are also denied as proper offsets. With respect to
transportation of agicultural implements and equipment defendant claims
an offset for the expenditure of $h?O.l;l; for the transportation of 717
spools of barbed m'._re in l90l, and $3lb.3O expended in 1902 for the tramportation of L83 spools of barbed wire and $6.36 for 10 kegs of staples
(G.A.0. Report, Def. Ex. 26, pp. lh§ and 11:7), a total of $791.10. “Pith
respect to the transportation for agricultural implements and equipment
the C-...‘\.O. Report shows $2145.00 expended for transportation of such items
in l90l and $208.61 in 1902. For the 1901 transportation expenditures

the transportation of agicultural implements and equipment for the wfbcal
year 1901 of $207.97. For the fiscal year 1902, the G.A..O. Report (p. 1115)
lists expenditures of $208.61 for the transportation of the s are type of
iters. Defendant (Def. Req. Fdg. 30(2)) concedes items totaling 5310.113
should be disallcnsed as offsets. Defendant’s claimed offsets for the transportation of a.~_:-::*ic~.11t':.'zral implements for the fiscal year l902 is therefore
$198.18, or total offsets under this heading for the fiscal ye-as l90l and
1902 of $«hO6.lS. These and all other ‘items for transportation of agricultural inplerents and equipment are not allowed asdproper offsets. Since
defendant is not allowed offsets for provisions or agricultural iztiplements
and equipment, defend—:=.nt‘s claim for offsets for the ransportation of such
items must be denied. ‘
