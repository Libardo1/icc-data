O_‘Marr, Commissioner, ‘deliyered the opinion of the Comission.

gfhe claim here 1-.9 be considered_ (rust Claim pleaded in the petition)
is beforens for a. second time. It ‘was first submitted last year and on
May lll, 1953, the Comission by order reopened the matter for the purpose
of permitting the parties to offer“ additional evidence on the question

as to whether the consideration received by the plaintiffs was unconscionaable. (See opinion of Comission, 2 Ind. (313. Com. 390. 3974399).

In accordance with the reopening of the case for further evidence

the ‘plaintiff s offered at a rehearing held october22, 1953, only one
exhibit (Pl. Bo. l2)iwhich is a census report made in 1880, while the
defendant offered 12 exhibits (Hos. 51 to 62) and the case was finally
closed. Ho other evidence was offered by either party“.

Although we ordered a reopening of the case for further proof that
would enable us to determine whether the consideration received by the
Saginaw for the relinquishment of their rights in the Saginaw Reservation
was unconscionable, the Saginaw, upon lwhom the burden of proof rests, has
offered us no additional proof whatever on that vital question. On the _
other hand, the Government haswffered much documentary evidence relating
to_ the status of the tribal rights and interests of the Saginaw in the two
reservations -- evidence not before us when we’ first had this claim under
consideration.

As to consideration, the Saginaw now say the $20,000 the Government
paid under Article ’4 of the l861l- treaty cannot be considered as part of_the
consideration because under section 2 of~the Indian Claims Commission not
money expended for education cannot bejconsidered as part of the consideration. Apparently, counsel fer the Saginaw is referring to gratuitous
emenditures made for the Indians. Such expenditures are not allowable as
offsets under the Act but the expenditurerfor the support and maintenance
of the “manual labor school” was not a gratuity within the provisions of
the act, but a treatyobligation of the Government (Sioux Tribe v. United
States, 112 0. 01s. 39, 31+) and therefore would be deductible if an award
were made.

The Saginaw again contend that they received no consideration for

the cession of the Saginaw Reservation because, as they again state,

' ‘- they already'owned the lands in the Isabella Reservation. We thought
this contention was fully covered.in our previous opinion but will

reiterate what we said‘before.

By the express terms of the 1855 treaty the individual members were
given the right to select lands within the area withdrawn from sale for

the benefit of the Saginaw. This privilege expired about July I, 1861.

'}(See Finding 3, first_provision of 0ttawas;and.Ghippewa treaty set forth

ptherein). Uhder Article 1 of the 1855 treaty, the Indians selected

27,931.80 acres in the Isabella Reservation out of a total of 98,051.13
acres therein_(Findings 2 and 12), and 5926.22 acres in the Saginaw
Reservation out of a total of 60,593.23 acres therein. (Findings 2 and
13). 
_ After the time expired for making selections, July 31; 1861, the

Indians had the exclusive right for the next five years to enter the lands
in either reservation. (Art. 1 of 1855 treaty). This "right to enter”
consisted of the right 5to entry in the usual manner and at the same rate
per acre, as other adjacent public lands are then held * ‘.” _(See provision of the 0ttawas_and Chippewa treaty which is made applicable by the
1855 treaty, as set forth in Finding 3). This provision of the Ottawas
and Chippewa treaty also provides that land “that shall not have been
appropriated or selected within five years shall remain the property of
the Uhited States.“ This indicates that it was only when and if the land
was selected or purchased (entered) that title to the land vested. ‘No
entries of unselected lands had been made in either reservation at the
time of the 1863 treaty, so what the Saginaw actually had at that time

were 70,119.33 acres in Isabella and 54,657.01 acres in Saginaw reser.._ .. .. . -. __.——¢-n—._.—.....-uuu....-—u-.-----—a_-.---——

vation of unselected lands in the two reservations. In other words,

at the time of the 1863 treaty they acquired.the unselected lands in
Isabella reservation which. prior to the 186k treaty could be acquired
only by entry and.paying for them at the price of “adjacent public lands.“

Withrespect to the purchase of lands under the 1855 treaty, it is
provided that the Indians shall have the "same right to sell and dispose
of land entered by them, under the provisions of the Act of Congress

known as the Graduation.Act, as is extended to the Ottawas and Chippewas

by the terms of said agreement." (Meaning the treaty referred to in

Finding 3). Turning to the Ottawas and Chippewa treaty of July 31, 1855,

11 Stat. 621. we find this provision:

“Any Indian who may have heretofore purchased-land for
actual settlement, under the act of Congress known_as the
Graduation.Act, may sell and dispose of the-same; and in such
case, no actual occupancy or residence by such Indians on lands
so purchased shall be necessary to enable him.to secure title

thereto."
Beading these provisions in connection with the related.provisions of the
1855 treaty the intention was to give the Saginaw members the right to
acquire the unselected lands by paying for them and to obtain an unv

restricted.patent without actual residence required by the Graduation Act.

The l86h treaty changed all of this. By express terms it eliminated

the right to “purchase the unselected lands" in the Isabella reserya.ion,
gave the Saginaw the ”exclusive'use, ownership, and occupancy“ of the

‘unselected lands therein, and gave the Indians the right to again make

selections therein, and without payment therefor. It was these rights,

plus the $20,000 for the manual labor school, that constituted the consideration for the cession of the Saginaw Reservation, so in order for

«us to decide whether the consideration was unconscionable we had to

know the value of the Saginaw reservation land, 60,593.23 acres, ceded.
Ehe Saginaw have failed in both respects. As to the unselected lands

in Isabella reservation. counsel for the plaintiffs cling to the notion
that such lands did.not constitute any part of the consideration for the
cession of Saginaw reservation lands - this. in spite of our previous
opinion -4 and as a result offered.nojproof as to the value thereof.

As to the value of the lands ceded,‘plaintiffs rely principally

upon a tabulation of sales made by defendant (Def. Ex. 1): .This tabur

lation shows some 500 sales aggregating h3,025.82 acres sold for $96,580.55,
or about $2.2h-per acre. Some four hundred of these sales were in hO—acre
tracts or less and the remainder in 80-acre or larger tracts. with the
largest of 187.65 acres. This would indicate a value of nuch less per acre
at the date of the treaty for the lands sold if made in aplarge tract. '
.Furthermore, these sales do not include 17,567.H1 acres of the railroad
land for vhich no acceptable proof of value has been offered.
In view of the above, we have no alternative but to dismiss the

petition as to the first cause of action. the remaining causes of action

having been disposed of by our order of May 1%, 1953.

To save any misunderstanding that might arise from these provisions

of Article 1 of the 18611» treaty:

‘The said Indians also agree to relinquish to the United

States all claim to any right they may possess to locate
lands in lieu of lands sold or disposed of by the United

States upon their reservation at Isabella ’ *.“

it may be well to discuss then briefly.

It seems the Saginaw thought they had rights to locate lands outside

of Isabella.to compensate them.for lands within the six townships described in the treaty of 1855, which had.been sold by defendant prior
to the treaty. eIt is difficult to find any'basis for this because by
the treaty of 1855 it was only the u_1_:§_ol_d_ public lands in the six townships that were withdrawn from sale for their benefit and, according to
thepevidence, they received 98,051.13 acres of them. In any event, the
claim was disposed of as we see by reading the following part of the

report of one of the treaty Commissioners. dated October 31, 186% (Def.

Bro 17. Po "513: n ' f‘ 1 "

“By the terms of this treaty it will be perceived that the
Indians relinquish their right to the several townships upon
Saginaw bay. and agree to make selections in severalty upon
the Isabella reservation. They also relinquish all claims to
locate lands outside of the reservation at Isabella, in lieut
of lands disposed of by the government prior to the establishv
ment of that reservation. '

‘This claim, the Indians informed me, would cover some 36,000
acres. Not being fully informed as to the validity of this claim,

‘but finding that the Indians considered it good and.valid for the
purposetf effecting a settlement thereof;, and as a consideration
for the relinquishment of the townships upon Saginaw bay, it was
stipulated.that the government should.pay the sum of $20,000 for
the support of a.manual labor school at Isabella. This is the
only expenditure of money involved.in the treaty, an amount insignificant in itself. in view of the relinquishments made by the
Indians and the importance of having them all concentrated upon

one reservation.F
