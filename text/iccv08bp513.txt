Decided: June 10, 1960

FINDINGS OF FACT

 

The Commission makes the following Findings of Fact:
‘ I

1. Pursuant to authority of the Indian Claims Commission Act of

August 13, l9h6, c. 9&9, 60 Stat. lohg 25 U.S.C. 70a, et seq., petitioner

’ timely filed its petition herein alleging four separate claims against de-fendant, the United States of America.

2. Claims One and Fbur only involved herein.

 

The original petition was amended on January lb, 1958, nith leave of

this Commission, and claims two and three eliminated from this docket number.
Claim One of the petition, as amended, alleges recognized Indian title, and
in the alternative, aboriginal Indian title to the lands ceded by the walla
Walla, Cayuse and Umatilla tribes by terms of the Treaty of June 9,'l85S,
(12 State 9k5,_II Kapp. 69h). Claim Four alleges aboriginal Indian title to
certain other adjacent lands in addition to the above nentioned ceded lands.
All of said lands are situated in northeast Oregon and southeast'Washington.

All issues except as to title in Claims One and Your have been pastponod

vending determination of said title issues as provided by order of this Commission

8 lnd. Cl. Comm. S13 S11:

Decenber 10, 1932.
This cause was consolidated with Docket 198, Confederated Tribes of Warm
Springs Reservation, only for purposes of hearing and will be decided as separate
cases, Docket Number l98 and 265, respectively.

3. Petitioner has legal capacity to sue.

   

Defendant admits that the petitioner brings this action as the “tribal
organization recognized by the Secretary of Interior as having authority to
represent the Coniederated Tribes of the walla walla, Cayuse, and Umatilla
Indians, party to the Treaty of June 9, 1855", 12 Stat. 9h9, II Kapp. 69h.
(Answer1I3amendedpetition, p. 2, par. L(a)).

h. Ceded Lands claimed in Claim One.

 

The lands claimed by petitioner in Claim.One are the lands the'Walla
walla, Ceyuse and Umatilla Tribes ceded to the United States in the Treaty
fdune 9, l8SS, more particularly described in the Treaty as follows:

%%% Commencing at the mouth of the Tocannon River, in

Washington Territory, running thence up said river to its

source; thence easterly along the summit of the Blue Mountains,
and on the southern boundaries of the purchase made of the Hes
Perces Indians, and easterly along that boundary to the western
limits of the country claimed by the Shoshonees or Snake Indians;
thence southerly along that boundary (being the meters of the
Powder River) to the source of Powder River; thence to the head'uaters of willow Creek; thence donn'Wi1lou Creek to the Columbia
River; thence up the channel of the Columbie'River to the lower
end of a large island below the mouth of the Umatilla River;
thence northerly to a point on the lakama Riv~r, called Tohmahv
luke; thence to Le Lac; thence to the White Banks on the Columbia
below Priest's Rapids; thence down the Columbia River to the
junction of the Columbia and Snake Rivers; thence up the Snake
River to the place of berinning: wee

sion 362).

The Treaty description did not delineate what portions of the ceded lands
were claimed or occupied, respectively, by the Hells Walla, Cqyuse, and Umetilla
tribes. The preamble to the Treaty of June 9, 1855 (12 Stat.» 919) recites that

the treaty parties are:

-see the United States, and the undersigned chiefs,
headmen, and delegates of the Welleehelle, Cayuses, and
Umatilla tribes, and bands of Indians, occupying lends
partly in Washington and partly in Oregon Territories,
and who, for the purposes of this treaty, are to be

.regerded as one nation acting for and in behalf of their
respective bands and tribes, they being duly authorized
thereto; it being understood that Superintendent I. I.
Stevens assumes to treat with that portion of the above
named bends and tribes residing within the Territory of

Weshington,'and Superintendent Palmer with those residing
within Oregon.

5. Aboriginelly the Three Tribes represented by
Petitioner had a Common Culture and Ierguage.

y.nu-1-0-u-u.--o—lu— 

r

.TheiWe11a Welles, Cayuses, end Uhctilla in aboriginal times were or the
Plateau culture and of the same basic Saheptin language stock (Rey, Tr. pp. 530,
59h, 6l0; Def; E3318, pp. 9 and 23-27 Suphan Report). Esrly shite observers
sometimes confused the‘Wall§'Wel1es with the Umatillas, and the Cqyuse with
the Nez Perce (Ray, Tr. 611-612). 'Thcsc_three tribes (walla walla, Unatilla
and CEYuS9) "are so intermarried and occupy country so near each other that

their interest are in common." (Ltr. of Aug. 1, 1857, by Agent.A. P.'Dennison,
Pet. m. 339) . ‘

6. Tribal Organisation.

 

Defendant‘s expert, Mr. Robert Suphan, reported the Hells Bells, Csyuee
and Umatilla each were "ethnic unities“ (Def. Es. lé, p. 3h). They are

identifiable as tribal entities (Pet. Ex. 63, p. 10}. In the main, their

more or less permanent winter villages were located along the Columbia, Ialla
Ualla, and Umatilla Rivers in each spots as afforded them a nearby supply of
fish, roots, and wood, as well as some shelter from the element. (Def. Ex.
18, p. 12) The plateau concept of village autonomy in local affairs existed
with a "spokesman" presiding over the village council (Pet. Ex. 63, p. 10;
:.a};', r. 612-613; Def. Ex. 18, p. 13). Lewis and Clark identified the "151:
Chief of all the Tribes" near the junction of the Columbia and Snake Rivers

as "felelep-pit," a chief of the "Hal lar war lar R. {Nation)." "Head chiefs"
subscribed their names to the Treaty of June 9, 1855, on behalf of each of the
respective tribes herein represented by petitioner (12 Stat. 9&5)i7. Aboriginally, Subject Indians were Separate
Ethnic and Land-using Entities or Tribes.

 

I)...-I--I -8...: ..... eeieione.-¥s expert, Dr.‘ Tierne 1?. My, testified that the Cayuse, Walla

--ila, and Umatilly'were each one a separate tribe in the proper sense of that
’ecrd as used by students of ethnology_(Tr., pp. 530, 59h); that each of said
three tribes had a very definite tribal organization (Tr. 613); without any
dialectical barrier between then (Tr. 61b); and that each tribe was a separate
tribe with a concept of occupancy of definite areas and with a system ofpermissive use, each of the other*s aboriginal areas (Tr. 630-631), and Dr.
Ray drew a map of such internal boundaries between said tribes (Tr. 573; Pet.
BX. 522); but Dr. Rayts opinion with respect to boundary lines had changed
somewhat since the date of his 1938 publication (Tr. 569).

During the period 1790 to l85’0 disease and pestil.c.nee reduced the populations of said three tribes. We find that the best population estimate vies made
by Governorlsaac I. tevens and General Joel Palmer at the time the Treaty of
1855 was negotiated, who estimated the respective population as 800 Walla Welles,
500 Cayuse, and 200 Umatillas (Pet. Eh:s. 276 and 277).

These iestinates compare favorably to the government census taken in
1870 when the total number of the three tribes was 1,622; oi‘ this number
837 resided on the reservation and 785 were on the Columbia River (Pet. Ex.

1138, p. 9'7).

9. Aboriginal Economy of Petitioner Tribes.

  

The Walla Welles and Uraatillas whose winter villages bordered the Columbia

River relied somewhat more on fishing than the Cay-use, who frequented the up’ lands and Blue Mountains (Ray, Tr. 635-658; Def. Ex. 18', pp. 23-25; Pet. Ex.

22, 13. 31:1). Essentially fishing, hunting, and gathering of roots and berries
constituted the economy of the petitioner tribes.

Their iishing sites included not only theicolumbia and Snake Rivers, but
also certain smaller streams yhich rose in the Blue I-ionntains and were filled
with salmon at several seasons of the year. Roots abonnded in both higher
rocky soil and in la:-rmoist soil. In the Blue Mountains were extensive bery
patches and also medicinal herbs.

Horses and cattle in large herds formed an importr:-:1t part of the
livelihood of these Indians and utilized a conside1‘ab.‘E-e e;a:;a'ese8of grassland
for their very mzraerous herds (Pet. Etc. 275, p. 111; Pet. Ex. 27?, p. 2; also

Pet mo N03» 511 at p. 1.16, 108 at pp. 88-89, 28 at p. }iCr3, an-:3 36 at p. 89).

The tribes wintered in their respective t;nter villages on the Columbia

and Snake Rivers. In spring they moved southward to the Blue Mountains to

dig roots and to headwaters of mountain streams to catch spring salmon. Only

in winter were they separated, in other seasons they roamed about in a seasonal

QREY, Tro 635-658; Def. Ex. 18, Ssphan Report, pp. 23-25)

10. Land Usage was Often Shared Among
the Umatilla, Cayuse, and Walla walla.

   

Subsistence areas of each tribe were generally south of their winter
villages.

*These areas were used seasonally and shared by the tribe exercising
1

§3n¢iP5l OCCtp:nsy'and use of same with one or both of the other two tribes.

The Umatilla'used most, if not all fishing sites, roots and berry gathering,

grazing, and hunting areas with members of the walla wallas. The walla Welles

used subsistence areas with the Cayuse, and the Cayase often used subsistence

areas with both the'Halla Nallas, and somewhat less, with the Unatillas.

(R37 3
Pet. Br. 53, 3. 17; Map, Def. Ex. 18$}

- lines that such use of subsistence areas did not in fact

‘ts a “nonwexclusiwe use,” or “free use are

a-oas.“ or areas "wandered

8 Ind. cl. Comm. 513 519
over by many tribes.'i To the contrary", the ev*.'Ldence clc :~.:'-ly establishes a
fixed pattern of use areas within an -alilzial cycle. The village areas on the
Saphan map (Def. Ex. l8A)i appear to be reasonably consistent with statements
of early I-Jhite observers of this region (Fdgs. 13a, Jos.  12f, Sir Geo.
Simpson; 12;], Marc Whitman; 12o, Geo. Gibbs and Gov. I." I. Stevens) and nith}
correspondence by early Indian Agents (Fdg. 13). However, the subsistence
 or stations shown on this map must be qualified by observations of
overlaps with other Indians,’ the Snake Indians south of the Blue Fiouiltains
and the Nez Perce on the east. Moreover, the source materials for this map
are almost entirely based upon information gathered fromrodern Indians in
the 191:1 Swindell Report (Tr. p. 71:7).

Horatio Hale, reporting on interior Indians of Oregon in 18346, found
their mode of life "diffiuclt to determine how it should be characterized. I
They have no fixed habitations and yet they are not, properly speaking, a
wandering people. Nearly every month of the year they change their place
of residence but the same month of every year" finds them regularly in the
same place." (Def. Far. 18, p. 23) I

11. Aboriginal Language and Religion.

 

The language of the Umatilla, -Walla I-fella, and Cayuse is classified as
sahaptin. The Cayuse language fell into disuse in aboriginal times (Bale,
Peta 355- 32, p. 2111). It was ur1i.nte_ligibl.e to the Walla Wallas and Umatillas.
The Cayuse adopted the Nez Perce dialect of Sahaptin language wrzbich was intelligible to Valle. Wallas and Umatillas. lhe Ur.2atill.ls spoke a dialect of the
Walla Walla language (Ray, Tr. 610-6114; Def. Ex. 18, p. 36).

Each tribe had a very si_ir1ilai~ g.1.a:».'-d'3.:::;l«- spii-it rel:?.g‘ on nhi eh involved a

a. Lewis and Clark 153?-1906.

   

In the fall of 1805 Lewis and Clark descended the Snake River from
leniston, Idaho, to the Columbia River, thence down the Columbia to its
mouth. In the spring of 1806 they returned overland along the Walla'Wel1a
and Touchet Rivers to Lewiston and eastward.

They reported large numbers of Indians living and fishing along the
Snake and Columbia Rivers. Below the mouth of the Walla walla River they

met ”Iel»lcp—pit" described as "the let Chief of all the tribes in this

quarter."
Claik estimated the “%e1—1ow—walv¢nw NSEIOD on both sides or the Columbia

Em the entrance of Lewis‘ river (Snake river) as low as Muscle shell rapid
and in winter pass over to the waters of the Tapeol river" as being a probable
number of 1600 souls.

Clark's map shows the “You mar talla" Nation on the lower Umatilla River
and listed the ”sho—Sho—ne (or Snake Indians)" as residing in spring and
summer on the heads of the Ib—war—ne~hi—ooks (Deschutes), La Page (John Day),
You-ma—tol-a (Umatilla), and wal-war—wal—nar (Wal1o'walla) rivers for the
purpose of fishing (Pet. Ex. h3, Vol. 3, pp..l31—132, Vol. 6, pp. 113-115;

Ex. 95, Stuart, Discovery of Oregon Trail). Hunt reported "at least two
thousand horses" on the upper matillo River.

c. David Thompson, 1811-1812.

 

Thompson, a partner of the Northeast Company, came down the Columbia
River in 1811 and returned upstream in 1812. Yellcpit of the Wa1la'Wallas
advised Thompson that his tribe would again possess the south part of their
country which was occupied by the "Stra: Tent Tribe“ (Nbrthern Paiute?).
Thompson estimated 13,615 souls lived on the Columbia River between its
mouth and-its junction with the (Snake) river (Pet. Ex. 100, pp. b89—h9l).

d. Alexander Ross, 18l1—l82h.

 

Rose, a Pacific Fur Company employee, traveled up the Columbia River
in 1811. He reported a camp of 1500 Walla Welles, Shaw Haptens, and
Cajouses, near the mouth of the wells walla River and noted, "the plains
were literally covered with horses,of which there could not hate been less
than four thousand in sight of the camp." The name "cayuse”, because of
this tribe's numerous horses, became a generic term for Indian ponies. (Pet.
be 66. pp, 137-138) 8

Ross also commented upon the different tribes around the Walla Walla
often going to war with their southern neighbors, the Snakes (Pet. Ex. 65,

p. 200). Ross described the west end, or spur, of the Blue Mountains as
the north line of the Snake Tribes (Pet. Ex. 65, p. 16?).

e. Robert Stuart, 1812.

 

Stuart of the Pacific Fur Company trateled up the Co1unbia‘River to

4-no-sale

the mouth of the'Walla Walla in 1812. tuart reported on the general

location of the walla Uallas at the entrance of that *iver. His journal
describes the "Sciatogas” (Cayuse?) as possessing “a tract of country,
bounded on the southeast by the Big Flat (Grande Rondo Valley), on the
north by Lewis‘ (Snake) river, on the west by the Columbia, and on the
south by the Walamat, comprising nearly 100 miles square, %*%." (Pet.

Ex. 96, pp. 81-82).

f. Sir George Simpson,_l82b—l82‘.

     

Sir George Simpson, Governor of Hudson's Bay Cempalyfs enterprises in
the Pacific Northwest, traveled along the Columbia River in 182k and 1825.
Simpson enumerated petitioner tribes as residing between the Cascades of

the Columbia River and the Rocky Mountains, thus:

'Youmatilloni ‘ Southside Small River
Wells Welles _Southside Walla Walla R.

Cayouse Beteeen walla Walla & Blue Mts.

upon passing through the Powder River Valley, "at our camp two lodges of
Kiuses." (Pet. Ex. 109, p. 231). i

h. Captain Benjamin Bonneville, 183k.

-0

         

Captain Benjamin Bonneville, a soldier on leave from the U. S. Army,
Gxblored the Umatilla, Grands Renee, Wallowa River K21 eye, and visited Fort
Walla Walla. Captain Bonneville reported the prairie: c, the Grende Rondo
are resorted to by small hands of Skyuses, to pasture their horses, as well

‘3 t0 banquet upon the salmon which abound in the neighhorinz waters." He

8 Ind. 01.. Comm. 513     S23

described the Skyuse horses as “of a breed infinitely superior to any in the
United States." (Pet. Ex. 36, pp. 2hh-250).
' i. iRev. Samuel Parker, 1835.
Reverend Parker, a missionary sponsored by the "American Board of Commissioners for Fbreign Missions," in 1835, traveled overland through the
Walla Walla Valley, thence down the Columbia River to Vancouver, Washington.
Rev. Parker reported the Cayuses west of the Nez Perces, and numbering more
than two thousand persons. He described this country, especially about the
Grande Ronde, as uncommonly fertile, producing cammas in abundance, upon which,
with fish and some game, they principally subsist.

Parker stated the'Halla Welles numbered about five hundred and ranged some

distance below their river and the Columbia river (Pet. Ex. 56, p. 301).

3. Marcus Whitman and H. H. Spalding, l836—l8h7.

 

‘Whitman and Spalding were missionaries sent by the same Mission Board

as Parker. Whitman established the Whitman.IKission in the'Walla'walla Valley
in 1836. h..h. Spalding established the Spalding mission the same year among
the Nez Perce Indians in Clearnater River Valley, about 100 miles east and
north of Whitman's mission. Whitman and his family were killed by Cayuse
Indians in 18L7. V '

- The Whitman and Spalding correspondence seems to add little to their
predecessor, Parker's observations, by way of description of Indian boundaries.
Spalding referred to the "Grand Round” as "in the Chuyoos Country."

‘Whitman reported Cayuse in the'Uella Walla valley and in the upper Umatilla

("Utilla") River Valley (Pet. Ex. lOhA, p. 9b; Pet. Ex. lChD, pp. L3h-bh73

n. Father P. J. De Smet, l8b5-l8h6.

 

Father P. J. De Smet, a Catholic missionary, traveled along the Columbia
River and visited Fort Walla‘walla and_the "Pslouse“ River. He described the
Nez ferces as north of the Shoshones living in a very fertile land well adapted
to agriculture, containing a great number of horses and rich grazing lands.
Desmet then described the Ceyuses as west of the Hes Perces, with a population
of 2,000. He compared their horses and fertility of soil favorably to Nez
Perces and also made mention of roots, fish and game as staple foods of the
Cayuse.

De Smet mentioned the Walla Wallas as about 500 in number with characteristics, habits, and customs "which differ in no respect" from those of the Indians
above named, the Nez Perce and Cayuse.

The “Pa1oos" tribe belongs to the nation of the Nez Perces, numbers about
300 and inhabits thesborders‘of the Nez Perces and Pavilion rivers. (Pet. Ex.

the Territory (Pet. Ex. lhh, p. 58). Governor Lane stated in his Annual
Report to”The Secretary of War, or the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,”
Gated October, 15b9, on subject Indians:

The Cayuse Indians inhabit the country from the foot of

the Blue Mountains to within twenty five miles of Walla Ualla -H-I-.
They have large hoards of horses and cattle, and live on fish, roots,

Joel Palmer, in their reports of Wells We la population (Pet. Ex. l60,
p. 90). Palmer commented upon the disparity of Dartis enumeration as
incredible (Def. Ex. 86).
c. In 1853 Joel Palmer succeeded Anson Dart as Superintendent
of Indian Affairs for Oregon. Palmer had served as Quartermaster General
in the Cayuse War of l8h8. In a letter to the Territorial Governor of
‘Washington Territory, Isaac I. Stevens, January 16, 185b, Palmer described
the boundaries of the Walla Welles and Cayuse: C
The boundary between the wallanellas and Cayuses, is
not well defined, but it is thought that but a small part
of the Territory of the former, if any, is within the limits

of this Territory. est

My understanding of their boundary as derived from
members of the Tribe in l8h8, is as follows:

Commencing on the South side or the Columbia river
a short distance above the mouth of the Utilla, it runs
Easterly so as to cross the wallenalla about ten or twelve
miles above fort Wallawalla; thence Northeasterly to then ‘
Snake river about twenty or twenty five miles from its
mouth; thence down said river and across the Columbia to
a point about 20 miles west or the last named river; thence
South‘Westerly to the mouth of the first stream emptying
into the Columbia on the North Side, a little above the
mouth of John.Day's river (Def. Ex. 86).

d.’ In 1853 Brevet Major Alvord, Commander of Fort Dalles,'reported
that the Cayusezresided mostly on the Umatilla, claiming an extent of country
(large in proportion to their present reduced numbers) from the Willow Creek
on the southwest to the Blue Mountains, and including the Grande Ronde, and
northward to within fifteen miles of Fort Walla-walla.

Alvord reported the Walla-Welles border upon Cayuoe and occupy the

country around Fort‘Halla4Halla upon the south bank of the Columbia.

5 Ind. c1. Comm. 513 528

e. In 155% R. R. Thompson, Indian Agent at Utilla Agency, reported
on the "Cayuses" and "Utillas“ but did not enumerate the walls Wallas among
the tribes of his district (Pet. as. 218, p. 1050-11). In the same year
Najor G. J. Rains, successor to Alvord as Commandant of Fort Dalles, reported
the walla Wa.las, Cayusc and Nez Perce were allied together, but Rains distinguished the territory of the Cayuse and Walla Wallas as inhabiting "the
region nest of the H02 Perce." (Pet. Ex. 205, p. 2).

r." The Swindell Report (19h1).

   

%Edsard G. Ssindell of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in l9hl conducted
a study or surrey of the location of the "usual and accustomed stations”
for fishing, the use of which by petitioner was "secured to the Indians in
common.nith citizens of the United States" by the terms of the Treaty of
fune 9, 1855. In conducting this survey, its scope was broadened to include
ithe recording of canp~sites, hunting and other subsistenc~ areas regularly
used by the tribes she were parties to the treaty of cession. The study
was conducted by parties of elderly Indians accompanied by interpreters who
drove over the subsistence areas and marked a series of cards to identify
each location. (Ray, Tr. 6h2§5h§;IDef. Ex. 105, p. 110).

The material and information contained in the Swindell Report and the
Suphan Hap (Def. Exs. 18; 18A, pp. A-1 to Aelh), and Mr. Suphan's testimony
based thereon (Tr. p. 7h?«77h), does not substantially show (1) aboriginal
Period and times of Indian use of such subsistence stations, (2) the interests and conflicting claims of adverse Indians, ax} t?) is not substantially corroborated by historical records, but is bssai "almost entirely“

upon the aemory of aged modern Indians.

lb. Cession Treaty of l8SS did not
Constitute ”Rococniacd Title."

 

The Treaty of 1855 recites:

nae Indians cede to the United States all and every
part of the country claimed by them %%% (Underscoring
supplied; Art. I, 12 Stat. 9&5; 2 Kapp. 69b)

There is no substantial evidence of facts or circumstances in the

record to establish a “recognized title" by the United States of petitioner
tribes’ claims to lands ceded by them to the United States in said treaty.

’ 15. In addition to the lands ceded by petitioneris antecedents to
the United States for which compensation is claimed in petitioner's "Claim
One," petitioner alleges Indian title (aboriginal use and occupancy) to
lands located in the State of Oregon, which lands are contiguous to the
west boundaries of the lands ceded by the Treaty of June 9, 1855. Petitioner
denominates the latter as "Claim Four." Said lands are described in the
amended petition as follows:

Commencing at a point on the boundary line of the lands
ceded by the walla'walla, Cayuse and Umatilla Tribes in the
Treaty of June 9, 1855, at the mouth of Ponder River; thence
southerly up the Snake River to the confluence of the Snake '
and Malheur Rivers; thence southwesterly up the.Halheur River
to the confluence of Halheur River and'Willou Creek, the latter
being a tributary o£VMalheur River; thence northuesterly to the
divide separating the waters of said willow Creek and Bully Creek;
thence northnesterly along said divide to the summit of Ironside
Mountain, which is a point on the crest of the Blue Mountains;
thence westerly along said summit to Spanish Peak; thence northeasterly along the divide separating the eaters of Birch Creek
and Cottonwood Creek to the confluence ofimountain Creek and
J°hn»D3F'River; thence northerly along the nearest escarpment
on the west side of the John Day River to the confluence of the
J°h“ D33 River and the North Fork of John Day River; thence
northerly, easterly, and northnesterly along the divide separating
the waters of the John Day River and the Forth Fork of the John
Day River and Willow Creek, the latter being a tributary of the
Columbia River, to the point on said divide nearest the Columbia

River; thence northerly to the Columbia River; thence northeastcrly
up the Columbia River to its confluence with the last~mentioncd
Willow Creek, the same being a point on the boundary of the lands
08585 by the Unatila, Walla Walla, and Cayuse Tribes in the Treaty
of June 9, 1855; thence southcastcrly, and easterly, along the
boundary of said cession to the point of beginning, all the foregoing description being shown as a red line on petitioner's

exhibit S21 herein. '

Petitioner subdivides the above described lands, as contained in
Claim Four of its amended petition, into three parcels:

Parcel "A": That portion located in the drainage-of and
along the west side of Willow Creek.

Parcel “B”: That portion located in the drainage of John

Day River, including its three fork .

Parcel “C”: That portion located in the drainage of Burnt
River and Willow Creek (South).

16. Evidence of Aboriginal Usage of
" .Parcel “A” Insufficient.

     

The petitioner cites Peter Hurdock*s map (Pet. Ex. 61, p. 395, fig. 2;
Pet. Brf, p. 99) as evidence of historical and doc'asntary nature in support
of Dr. Verne F2 Rayis conclusion that Parcel "A" is within the aboriginal
boundaries of the Umatilla Tribe. It is noted said map does not show the
principal river, the Umatilla, used and occupied by the tribe of the same
name. ‘we are unable to so interpret the Murdock map as urged by petitioner.
Parcel “A” was included in the cession by the Hwrampum Indians in the

Treahy of June 25, ldS5'(l2 Stat. 963, II Kapp. Ylh) and was not included in

petitioner tribes‘ cession treaty of the same year.

The forks of the Upper John Day River and other portions of the area
south of the Blue éountains were non-exclusively used by Snake, Umatilla,
and Ceyuse Indians.

David Thompson reported in 1811 that the south part of the Blue Mountains

"was abandoned by We11e'Wa11as because of hostility with the Straw Tent Tribe.

This iact'was related earlier by Lewis and Clark (Def. Ex. 18, p. Eh; Fdgs.
12a, 12f, above)._

I - Wilson Price Hunt, in December 1811, reported "six huts of Chochomis"
in the valley of the Grande Rondo in or near the Blue Mountains (her.

ex. 18, p. 61;; I-‘dg. 121:, above.)

Alexander Ross (1811-182h) reported the B1ue'Mounteins "forms the
northern boundary of the Great Snake Nation" (Pet. Ex. 65, p. 167; Def. Ex.
18, p. 65; Fdg. 12d, abore).

Peter Ogden reported Northern Paiutes on the:main John Day in 1826 (Def.
Ex. 18, p. 65; Elliott, 1909, p. 350.)

John‘Work reported Peiutes near present John Day, Oregon, in 1831, and
in 1832 reported a family ofihountain Snakes on the Middle Fork of John Day’

near present Bates, Oregon, and also signs of Paiutes on the Silvies River

in 1832. (Def. Ex. 18, p. 65; Lewis at Phillip, p. 171).

Petitioner's claims to both Parcel "B" and Parcel "C" of Claim h to
extra oession lends raises the question of the eheriginel southern boundary
of the Umatille and Ceyuse. On the nature of evidence supporting same petitioneris expert testified as follees (Tr. 639~6?n1:

(Dr. Ray) A. Quite impossible.

(Mr. Luce) Q. What methods, from an ethnological viewpoint,
must be used in an endeavor to locate the point where the Umatilla

the Paiute?

(Dr. Ray) A. Ethnologioal field work devoted to what we
speak of as the reconstruction of history.

(Commissioner 0‘Marr) That means information you obtained
from.informants?

(The Witness) That's right.

(Mr. Iuce) Q. Have any other ethnologists expressed
a like opinion?

(Dr. Ray) A.
for one.

Yes, they have. Professor A. L. Kroeber,

Dr. Ray drew the Umatilla—Cayuse southern boundary, extended to the
Shoshonean peoplefs northern boundary, above (north of) the forks of the

John Day River in the Blue Mountains "in the 18th century and earlier."

(Pet. Ex. 61, map, p. 386). In a publication two years earlier, 1936,
Dr. Ray drew the Umatilla boundary encompassing the drainage of most, if

not all, of the'Upper John Day River (Pet. Ex. 59, map, p. 103). Dr. Ray

testified, "Paiute presence on the John Day River, itself, on the course
that is shown here, extreme south, was on the same basis as it'was farther
to the north; that is, a raid and enemy attempt at utilization when the

Could get away with it.” (Tr. to. S68~S69)

P18. Evidence of Aboriginal Usage of

Parcel "0" Insufficient.

 

In support of the opinions expressed by Dr. Verne F. Ray that Cayuse
Indians occupied Parcel "C" we are referred to a number of exhibits (Pet.
Ex. 61, p. hos, fig. 3; Pet. Ex. 95, Map 1:; Pet. ex. 91:, Map I; Pet. Ex.
93, p. hh7, fig. 29) among other evidence cited by petitioner (Pet. Br.,
we have examined said exhibits and conclude that the most that
can be determined from.them is that this evidence contains no indication
that any tribe "other than Dayuse" resided in Parcel "C". ‘But.we do not
find a reasonable inference from the.reports of treaty times that Cayuse
exclusively occupied Parcel "C" or anypportion of same.

In Beatrice Blythe's map (Pet. Ex. 61, p. 396, fig. 2) the approximate
western half ofIParcel "C" is marked "Elk Eaters", attend of the Northern

that Snake Indians were seen in Parcel “C” more often, and usually in

larger numbers than Cayuse Indians. In all events, we conclude that even

if it be assumed or inferred that the Cayuse occupied willow Creek (south)
and Burnt River (and the weight of evidence does not support such inference).
yet the several references above cited often mention the presence of Snake
Indians and establishes that Parcel “G” was not exclusively used by the

Cayuse. Certainly they did not exclude their unfriendly neighbors, the

sites, apparently both camps and villages, but omits Yakima use stations
or sites on the Yakima River or in the Horse Heaven Hills.

Wallula was a principal village, later the site of "Fort Walla walla"
(Tr. 549; 532).

and the record as a whole, that the Umatilla, Walla walla, and Cayuse Tribes
of American Indians exclusively used and occupied, and each of said tribes

had, on the date of defendant's liability, Indian title to a separate tract

of land, bounded and described as follows:
