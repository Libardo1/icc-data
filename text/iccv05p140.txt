hearing the parties stipulated that the cause would be tried on the limited
issues raised by the defendant as to whether or not the petitioner has
capacity to use, whether or not it exclusively used and occupied its
claimed area of land in aboriginal times, and if so, whether or not the
defendant unlawfully deprived petitioner thereof, postponing until after
such determination, should such deternination be favorable to petitioner,
proof as to value thereof, the consideration defendant paid therefor, or
as to any other questions of f*ct raised by the pleadings not herein or
heretofore determined By the Commission.

3. The lands and appurtenances which petitioner claims to have held
by original Indian title are set forth in the amended petition and are located in the northwestern part of the present State and former Territory
of Washington, and are described as follows: (Amended Petition, Par. III).

That portion of the area described and ceded in the Point
Elliott Treaty made at Muckilteo, Washington, January 22,
1855 (12 Stat. 927) lying on the west side of Puget Sound
and more fully described as follows:

Commencing at Suquamish Head which is now_knonn.as
Foulweather Bluff; thence southwesterly, through the
Peninsula, and following the divide between Hood's
Canal and Admiralty Inlet CO the portage known as
Wilkes‘ Pcrtage (which is the narrow neck of land
between the east toe of Hood's Canal and the ncrth
end of Gig Harbor); thence ncrtheastwardly to Point

shore of Bainbridge Island to Point Monroe at the northeast end thereof; thence northeastward to Jefferson Head
on the peninsula; thence northward along the east share of
the peninsula to the point of beginning. ‘

h. (a) By Act of August lh, l8h8 (9 Stat. 323), Congress created
the Territory of Oregon within the area of which lived various Indian
tribes and bands, including the Suquamish Indians. The Act made all
land laws of the United States applicable to Oregon Territori, and in
Section 1 provided that nothing therein contained “shall be construed
to impair the rights of persons or property now pertaining to the Indians
in said territory so long as such rights remain unextinguished by treaty
between the Un'ted States and such Indians * * *."

(b) By an Act dated June 5, 1850 (9 Stat. L37), Congress authorized the negotiations of‘treaties'with the Ind’an tribes in the Territory of Oregon for the extinguishing of their claims to lands lying nest

of the Cascade Mountain

(C) By the Act of March 2, 1853 (10 Stat. 172), Congress organized the Territory of'Washington out of the north half of Oregon Territory, and by Section 12 of said Act provision was made that all laws of
Congress relating to Oregon Territory, not inconsistent with said 1853
act, were continued in force in the newly created Washington Territory.
Section 2 of the Act provided for the appointment of a Governor who was
also to perform the duties of Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the
Territory.

S. Apparently the first white contact made with the Indians of
what is now the State of Washington occurred in 1752 when Juan de Fuca,
a Spanish captain, reached the straits named for hin. Captain Seorge
Vancouver visited the area in 1792, and the Hndsons Bay Company soon
became active in the region. In.May of 1792, Vancouver explored Sinclair
Inlet, and saw some unnamed Indians moving, presumably to a summer camp
Site (Dft. Ex. 1a, p. II-1). In 1d2h, the explorer John Wdrk wrote “we
stopped at the Soouamis village situated in the bay [apparently Pprt
Madiso§7 of the same name, it consists of h houses. ‘we saw only 8 or
ten men, but understand several of th inhabitants were off_fishing."
(Dft. Ex. 161, pp. 213, 225). C~ptain Char1es'Eilkes, who headed the
United States Exploring Expedition.through the Northwest Coast through
1838-18b2, reported “On entering the canal [good Canal?) they encanped'

Agent E. A. Starling reported, in 15352, that the "Tuanooch" were located '
at the mouth of Hood Canal and their “supposed number" was "lSO.“ He

located the "S'z«:okor:~..ish" at the head of §ood‘s Canal with a supposed

'subchiefs and.stated:

ion of "lSO”, and he placed the “Snocuamish“ at “Port Orchard,

Elliots bay, and vicinity“ and noted their “supposed number" at “LOO”

(oft. BX. 199, p. h€O). In May of lB53, General A. V. Kautz wrote
(Dft. Ex. 8h, no. l8l-l8h): “A fair wind carried.us a mi_e beyond Point

apparently made by George Gibos in 1853-l85h: shows the name ”Suquamish"

between a point near Camp Union and a point south of Port Gamble.

8.

On September 1, l8S3, Lieutenant De L. Floyd Jones reported the
"Snoquamish,"'with a "supposed.number" of "30 or ho," were located at

“Port Orchard, Elliot's bay and vicinity." He noted the "Snoshomish and
Tuanooch," with a population of ”300," at the "head of Hood‘s canal"

(Dft. Ex. l87, p. 5). Jones stated “In locating the tribe, I have taken

rthat point at which they made their winter quarters; for in.the summer

they here no permanent location but travel from point to point, stopping
at those places which furnish them most readily the necessary supply of
5006." (p. 6). He also noted that "each family uses about one-quarter
of an acre of ground" for potatoes (p. 7), and that they reside "uponi
the water" and depend "almost entirely upon its products for their subsistence" (p. 9). Gn.March ll, l8Sh, Dr. George Gibbs reported (Dft.
Ex. 81, pp. 20, 22) that he had recognized certain Indians as chiefs and
“There were present Potkanan with part of_the

Snoqualmcos and Seattle with those of the Dwamish in town, also George

9. Governor I. I. Stevens, who was also Superintendent of Indian

Affairs for Eashington.Territory, on September l6, l8Sh, reported (Dft.

EX. llb, p. hS3):

To the north of this [KTise_uei1z7 group another may be
found of those inhabiting the shores of Admiralty inlet,
from Pu—gal-lup river to Su-quamish Head, including Vashon’s
and Bainbridge‘s islands, Port Orchard, Elliott bay, and
Dwamish river and Fort Madison. Most of them.are nominally
under a chief named Seattle, belonging to the Lu-qua-mish
tribe, but residing principally'with another, the Dwamish.
* t * another clan of the same tribe, the Sa-ma-mish, are
also called Sa—ba-bish and the name Suqua-mich is frequently
changed into Lugua-mish. The Dwa-mish are the best known.of
this connexion from.their neighborhood to the rising town
named after their chief, Se-at-t_e; and the whole generally
bare this name, though they are by no means the most numerous.
Their proper seat is the outlet of a large lake emptying into
the Dwamish river, and not on the main branch. At that place
they and some others have small patches of potato ground,
amounting altogether to perhaps thirty acres, where it is

Stevens located the Suquamish on.the "Peninsula between.Hood’s Canal and
Admiralty Inlet“ and estimated these Indians at h8S people. The Governor
also located.the S'Ho'ma'mish on Vashon's Island and estimated them.at

33 persons.

l0. Stevens‘ map of September l6, l8Sh, shows the word "Nisqually"
over a large area including many other names, among which appears the
‘word "Suquamish" east of Hood Canal between Seabeck or Crosby and the
head of Port Gamble (Bit. Ex. IOS). On December 30, 185k, Stevens
reported the "whilst" the Indians "cultivcted small patches of potatoes, their principal food.is fish.and roots and berries w % %" (Dft.
BX. 200). He also noted.that the Indians of the islands an the eastern

shore of the Sound raised.6,hCO bushels of potatoes. A mcp apparent_y

made in the summer of 185 by C ntain George Stoneman and lst Lt.

engineers, shows the ”Suouamish Tribe” in an area

northeast of Port Gamble and also in on area between Seabeck and Silverdaleg Bainbridge Island bears the names “Duamish.Z§uwamis§7 and Sub-aumish g7"; south of Port Gamble and just west of the Fort Madison
Reservation appear the words fDwamish Tribe." .

ll. On December 26, 1853, Isaac Stevens, the first Governor and
ex-officio Superintendent of Indian Affairs of Washington Territory,
wrote to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs suggesting the urgent
necessity for making treaties immediately with.the Indians west of the

Cascade Mountains in'Washington Territory. He pointed out that these

By Act of July 31, 185k (10 Stat. 315, 330) an appropriation was
made by Congress for expenses of rsking treaties with the Indians in
'Eashington Territory U0 extinguish their claim.to lands. Thereafter, on
August 30, l8Sh, the Acting Commissioner of Indian Affairs notified
Governor Stevens of his fficial appointment to neaotiate treaties with

F!Hall tribes in'Washington Territory by which the United States would

extinguish their "claim of title” to all their lands, except such limited

areas as might be assigned then for future occupancy; Stevens was also

numerous bands and zrasnents or trices into trloes,” and to luinisn the

Commissioner of Indian Arffairs a skeleton map of Washington Territory,
showing the location of the diiferent tribes and bands, and the boundaries
of the regions claimed by each.

In carrying out his duties as Superintendent of Indian Affairs,
Governor Stevens had previousli , on March 22, 1851:, appointed Colonel
Simmons as Indian Agent for the Puget Sound District wherein the claimed
lands were located, and directed him to visit the vamious tribes in his
District, make a census of the tribes and bands, ascertaining as nearly as
possible the boundaries of the territory claimed by each, and at the same
time organize the small bands into tribes and. appoint chiefs for each.

12. Pursuant to the Act of°July 31, 185k, supra, and the instructions
of the Commissioner of Indian Ai‘fairs, Governor Stevens negotiated the
treaty of January 22, 1855 (12 Stat. 927) between t'ne_United States and
twenty-two named tribes “and other allied and subordinate tribes and bands
of Indians occupying certain lands situated in said Territory of Washington

The treaty, commonly referred to as the Point Elliott Treaty, ‘
was not ratified by the United States Senate until March 8, 1859, and was
proclaimed April l_'!., 1859. The Suquamish Tribe of Indians was named in
the treaty preamble as a party and seven of the eighty-two signatures are
those of the Suquamish chief and sub-chiefs. By its terms the said tribes
and bands ceded, relinquished and conveyed all their right, t'tle and

Placed under the charge of the Indian agents on the Fort Madison Reservation at Suqnamish,'Washington, along with the Duwamish Indians.

lb. On December 30, 1855, agent M. T. Simmons reported.(Dft. Ex.

201, p. 2):

29th arrived at the Duwamish.& Squanish reservations in
Fort Madison at the entrance to “_aline Passage.’ Here I
found a large assemblage of their tribes. Here they have
a large house said to have been put up by Chief Seattle
some LO years ago. It is 525 feet long, 60 feet wide,

18 feet high. On the post are carved ingitations of the
human.figure. Had the Indians arranged in files, then
counted them, there being 51 old and 176 young men, 68 old
and 181 young women, 85 boys, 80 girls, 38 male and.58
female babies.

A map apparently made by Lt. G. H. hendell, a topographical engineer, and
Dr. George Gibbs, in 1856, bears the name "Suquamish" between a point
near Keyport and a point near Sheridan.
15. On March 3, 1856, Hr. Y. E. Tobin reported that he had removed

150 Indians from the Seattle area.“to a.sma1l bay selected.by themselves
situated on the east side of Bainhridge Island about 3 miles from its

head, at that is known as 'Baun‘s Point’” (Dft. Ex. 81, p. 32). Agent

I

. S. Laynard renorted on September 1?, 1850, that he ha taken charge

 

of the "Suquamish," numbering about 500 (Dft. Ex. 80, pp. 86-88). On

September 26, l8S Indian Agent G. A. Paige reported that he had charge

“over the Suouamish or Seattle Tribe belonging on the shores of the Sound,

On December 29, 1856, immons reported.that he had distributed goods

town of Silverdale on Kitsap Peninsula and a point north of Ferncliff on

On June 30,
1857, Paige reported from the Fort Madison Reservation that he _ad 750
Indians “one band of about LSO being encamped at this place and the remainder % * * near the mouth of the Duwamish River” (Dft. Ex. 202, p. 6).
Agent Simmons reported on July l, l857, that the "Snohomishes inhabit the
country around Seattle“ (Dft. Ex. 66, p. 620). Agent Paige reported on
August l, 1857, that "The Suquamish * %-% claim all the land lying on
the west side of the Sound, between Apple Tree Cove on the north, and

Gig Harbor on the south“ (Dft. Ex. 66, page 617). He noted that the

8
“Du*amish" and.“Suquamish” Indians were “intermarried, and frequently
visited one another, and from their proximity are frequently thrown

together."

Ethnological

 

17. Apparently the earliest ethnological work relating to western
‘Washington was done by Horatio Hale, the philologist with the United
States Expldring Expedition in l838Al8h2 (Dft. Ex. 21). Hale obtainedl
the name "Sukmames“ from a Canadian trapper who located them north of
Fort Nisqually (pp. 220, 221). ‘Hale‘s maps designate the areas claimed
as "SRwale“ or "I~Ijsqually" and the '5-Iord‘"Suo_uaznish" does not appear
thereon (Dft. Exs. 112; 192).

18. In 1851-1857, Dr. Henry R. Schoolcraft located a "Lcquamish”
Tribe on "Hoods reef" with a population of £85; a "ToanhoochV Tribe
on "Hod‘s._hoo§, canal" with a population of 2&5, and a "Shokomish"

Tribe with a population of 200 also on "§OQ'S Z§ood7 canal" (Dft. Ex.

170, pp» h90—h9l). As cited by Schoolcr ft, Achilles de Harley reported

that “The Hoostlalums consisted of ll tribes or Septs living about the

19.. Dr. George Gibbs , in 1851;, includes within one group the

Indians “inhabiting the shores of Admiralty Inlet from Puyallup River
to Suquamish head, including Vashores _/_'Vashon7 and Bainbridge Islands,

Port Orchard, Elliot Bay and the DU.-Eaznish River and Fort Madison." He

notes that “Most of them are nominally under a chief named Seattle, belonging to the Suquamish Tribe , but residing principally with another

end,“ with a population of 200 and th "Suquamis'n'*" on the “Peninsula between Hoods Canal and Admiralty Inlet" with a population of 1185 (Dft. Ex‘.

189, p. I465). A map dated 1856, apparently drawn by George Gibbs, bears

the name "Suquamish" between a point on Kitsap Peninsula about one mile
north of Silverdale and a point on Bainbridge Islam about one mile north
of Ferncliff (Dft. m. 176).

20. The ‘:3. H. Ball map, based upon the work of Dr. George Gibbs,

D

which was published in 1.876, does not show the name "Sucu ar::ish" in the

areas claimed, but shows the following names in said areas: “Skwa1»:ksnamish,

-1

"Dwamish” and "'I.‘ser:1aI-_m.*r2"‘ (Dft. 123:. 193). In'l877, Gibbs makes a division

peninsula between E-Iood Canal and Admiralty Inlet -31-   In this connection

are also the Samamish, Skopahmish, Sk‘te‘nlmis‘n, St’ka_mish, and other small
bands lying upon the lakes and the branches of the Dwamish River, who are
claimed by the others as part of their tribe, but have in reality very little
connection with them." He notes that ”unsettled lands a'ay from their usual
haunts are but little regarded. Tribes are, however, somewhat tenacious
of territorial right, and well understand their respective limits; but
this seems to be merely as regards their title, and they never, it is
believed exclude from them other friendly tribes.  -::- -:2 Nor do they have
disputes as to their hunting grounds. Land and sea appear to be open to
all with whom they are not at war -31-  -31- _[pp. 186-1827 -31-  -31- There are, in
fact, no generic names used by the Indians anong their own tribes, but
each band is distinguished by its appropricte appellation, that of the
ground which it occupies“ (pp. 235-236).

21. Dr. Edward S. Curtis in “The North American Indian" (l9l3)
reported the location of three separate groups in parts of the areas
claimed, as follows (Dft. Ex. 14?, p. 17h):

E Sqababsh (Shomamish), Vashon island and the
opposite mainland from Gig Harbor to Colby,
Washington. ~
5'9-‘ll.-k‘-IaiB’I1 (Suquamish), also called Suoabah,

Bainbridge island and the mainland from Colby
to F oulweather bluff.

S’ha1cta'osh (Shaktabsh), D-yes inlet and Sinclairs

Curtis noted further that the Indians were dependent "upon seafood -31- -31- -31almost lived in canoes -31- -31-  the long summer zras soent in movinc: from

majority of the tribes hunted little on land. The forest jungle was

difficult to penetrate and the flesh of land animals was not particularly

Q

relished,“ (p. E); and “each small community" was “independent of all
others“ (p. 67).

22. Dr. Leslie Spier's study, "Tribal Distribution in Washington,“
published in 1936, reveals much useful information (Dft. '13:. 5, p. 31:):

The data on the Suquamish are quite confused and they
territory can be stated only by eliminating the lands of the
Duwamish and Snohomish. It would appear that the Suquamish
were (1) simultaneously on th sides of Puget Sound, or
(2) occupied the two sides at different historic periods,
OI‘ (3) represent groups of identical name on each side. It
seems smplest to follow the first alternative.

Subtracting the Seattle area as Duwamish from Gibbs‘
description of joint Duwamish-Suquamish territory, we have
for the latter Bainbridge Island and the peninsula to the
west. We can add to this Paige's statement (l_8S7) that the
Suquanish “claim. all the land lying on the west side of the
sound, between Apple Tree cove _/_?~;~:-, I{ingsto_r_1_7 on the north,
and Gig Harbor on the south.“ '

Curtis‘ description omits Suo_uamish occupation of the
east side of the sound, assigning the territory in question
to the Snohomish, and for the west side notes three groups
“ithin the span designated by Paige as Suquamish: “Swukwabsh

234. Dr. John R. Swanton, in “The Indian Tribes of North America"

states ('—3.A.E. Bul. l}_~,S, I952, 33. b.hS_) that the word "Suquar:1ish” comes

“’"‘rom a native place nan .“ S‘:-ranton located the "Suquamish“ Indians on

the west side of T get Sound, according to Paige (1857) claimrg the

territory from A_pl..gate Cove to Gig Harbor.” Under ’’subdivisions and

Suquamish, on Liberty Bay, at Port Madison, and on the
northern part of Blakely Island, with villages at Suquamish,
above Poulsbo, and at Point Monroe.

25. On March 21, l9S6, Dr.'William'W. Elmendorf testified in

the Skokomish case (Doc. 296) and provided the Commission with a map

 

which apparently purports to show part of the western boundary of the

‘I

“Suquamish“ area (Dft. Ex. 210). He has the word “Suquamish" between

tthe town of Scandia and the Port Madison.Reservation. His eastern

boundary conflicts with Mr. Snyder‘s western boundary. Dr. Elmendorf
indicates, by the use of slanted lines, at least two areas of joint
use--the northern part of Kitsap Peninsu1a.and the Chico- 'tsap and
\*3iJ.dc at Lake area.

26. ‘Warren A. Snyder, a graduate Student in anthropology at the
University of Kashington, testified as an.expert witness for petitioner.
On the basis of information furnished him by Indian informants he stated
there had been Suquamish Indian.villages at Olalla, Colby, Suquamish
and Point Bolen, and on Bainbridge Island at Pleasant Beach and.Battle'
Point; and.camping sites near Forest City on Sinclair Inlet, near Chico
on.Dyes Inlet, ct Poulsbo, at Apple Cove Point and at Eglon. (Tr. 9399; lOS-l07). Dr. Carroll L. Riley, ethnologist, appeared as an expert
‘witness for defendant and also submitted.a written report which is in
evidence as defendant's Exhibit H . l. In.his report, Doctor Riley

states an.informant gave him the following sites used for settlements

or for fishing stations or encampments: (1) a small house at the head

of Liberty Bay; (2) a small house at Colby; (3) a temporary settlement

Dyes Inlet (S) Sucuamish; (6) Port Elaicely. Defendant's ‘witness rehe

ported that: (Def. Ex. l, page II-8)

The Indians designated Suouamish lived in villages along
the west side of the Great "Peninsula. The most important
seems to have been near the present town of SuC_uamish.
Population estimates for the treaty period indicate the‘

Indians in this area had two or more winter settlements.
Aside from the village at Suquamish, there may have been

Pg"

one at Dyes Inlet and possibly another on Liberty Bay.

37. In aboriginal times village autonomy prevailed in the area
claimed by petitioner and since these Indians obtained a major part of
their subsistence from the bays, streams and lakes. of the area where they
lived, their villages were generally located on the lands adj "cent to thei.
main fishbg places. These yi__lages were also located to give the Indians
access to other means of support needed to supplement the food obtained
from the waters and large areas away from the villages were also utilized
by the villagers ‘for gathering of berries and roots and for hunting. In
each of the several villages in the area claimed were concentrated Indians,
sharing a common culture and common dialect, who were linked with the
Indians of the other villages of the area by means of social and economic
ties also. Even prior to the necessity ‘of some semblance of political
organization between these villages to, permit them to deal with the agents
and officers of the Unite States, they were known collectively as
Suquarish because of the ties between the villages and as such were an
identifiable group historically. For the same reasons these villagers

nuntim and fishing spots in the outlying contiguous areas distant from their villages. It is found, therefore, that peti28. The Commission finds that there existed at the time of the
Treatf 05 January 22, 1855, l2 Stat. 927, gn identifiable group of
American Indians known then collectively as Suquamish Indians residing
in two or three permanent villages located within the area now claimed
by petitioner, and that it was through the efforts of officials of the

Unite States that these village groups amalgamated and went upon the

reservation establishedf or them by the Government at Fort Madison and
that descendants have continued to reside on or near the reservation
since the treaty. Petitioner, the Suquamish Tribe of Indians, therefore,
is an identifiable tribe of American Indians within the meaning of the
Indian Claims Commission Act of August 13, 191.16 (60 Stat. l0l;9), and as
such is entitled to maintain this cause of action.

29. The Commission finds that the petitioner and its ancestors

held original Indian title, as of; the date they were acquired by the

United States, March 8, 1839, to the lands within the following boundaries:

All the lands on Bainbridgelsland; and also those lands
on the Great Peninsula between Hood Canal and Admir ty Inlet
‘within a line drawn starting at Kingston; thence in a southwestwardly direction to the southwest correr of Sec. l0,
T. 26 N., Range 1 E., just north of I.ibert'y' Ba’; thence in a
southerly direction to the northwest corner of Sec. 1, T. 2].; 3%.,

580- 35, T. 21; 1%., ange l 1*-3., thence directly east to the
shores of Puget Sound near South Colby; thence in a northerly
direction following the shoreline to the place of beginning at
