%is case is now before us a. second time. Eden originally considered.
we dismissed the petition and the Osage Ration appealed to the Court of
Claims and on may 1, 1951, thatcourt reversed the Commission and renanded the case for father proceedings. (119 c. C15. 592).
It is conceded by the parties that ‘under the decision of the Court

of Claims the basic question now before us is the value oi‘ the lands
ceded by the Osage under the treaty of September 29, 3.865, 112- Stat. 687.

This determination, however, hashecome complicated by incidents which

have taken place since the case was remanded. These will be taken up

later.

When we tried this case we accepted petitioner's theory, as its
counsel construed the petition, that the claim was for the market value
ofjthe lands as. of the date of the cession, September 29, 1865 (1; Ind.
018. Com. {#3, 75), although we had doubts as to whether the petitioner
pleaded a claim for anything more than amount of the “civilization fund“

created by the 1865 treaty. The Chief Commissioner of the Indian Claims
Commission at the time of our original decision thought the Osage should
‘recover ‘$776,?’-£3.03, ‘being the amount the land was worth. in excess of

what the Indians receivedior it.’ (Incidentally, this amount is what p

the Government received for the land, less the cost of stmveying and the

sum the Osage received from  civilization fund set up ‘by Article 

of the 1865 treaty). The Court of _Claims also accepted our view of the

pleading, for in its opinion (p. 599) it described the Osage claim as

follows :

‘Appellant's claim, in-essence, is for additional compensation, to be measured ‘by the fair market value on September

29.;1865 1' '~.-» (119 6. Ola. 599).

In its opinion, the Court of Claims discussed unilateral. mistake and

held that our finding and holding that the article of the treaty ,gespect- .

ing the use of the net proceeds from the sale of the land "was fully

explained to and understood by the Indians is not sustained by substantial

evidence.” We find nothing in this conclusion even tending to require

for petitioner seem to think. This must be true because the court
with clearness and positiveness directed the basis upon which a

recovery should be made, later to be stated.

The court also dismissed at some length the meaning and effect of
clause (5), the fair and honora’ole'vdeaJ.ings clause, so-called, as applied

to this case. We are pleased to_ have the court‘s views on this clause;

the? are helpful in other cases. Since, as the court has said, we need

not consider the claim under this clause if we are to make an award based

on unconscionable consideration, we shall pass on to other contested

questions .

The court also definitely held that the consideration of $300,000

for the Osage tract of some 865,000 acres was unconscionable and also

held that ..

‘Appellants are entitled to an award representing the
fair actual value of the land on September 29, 1865, which
we have concluded was greatly in excess of the 334 cents per

acre Paid therefor, less the $300,000 already paid to appellants, and less the expenses of survey and sale  the
parties have agreed amount to $21L,372.20."

We shall, accordingly, fix the amount of the award on the basis of the

value of the ceded lands as of September 29, 1865,‘ the date of the treaty.

Before discussing the value of the lands here involved, however, 0
mention must be made of a departure from the theory upon which the case

was originally tried by this Comission and as presented to the Court

of Claims on appeal.

the case to us and nearly two years after the time for filing claims with

the Commission had expired, the petitioner on June ll, 1953, moved for

an order permitting the petitioner to amend its petition and see}: an award
based. upon the amount the ceded lands would have sold for had they been
sold in accordance with the treaty provisions. The amendment wasallo-wed
by the Commission on July 9, 1953, but petitioner was granted the alternative right to an award for the “fair actual value of the land as oi‘ the
date of ‘the treaty.“ _ .

‘ The amendment as presented was based upon this casual statement con' tained in the Court of Claims opinion (p. 662); "No attempt was ever_

made by the Government to dispose of the land on the operfmarket for cash
at the most advantageous price obtainable.“ And. at the hearings on land |
values the Osage offered proof; of the value of the land as of September 29,
1355, and over the Government's objections the Osage were permitted to
offer prooi of value if it had been sold, as required by Article 1 of the
treaty: on the “most advantageous terms, for leash, as public lands are
surveyed and sold under enlsting ‘laws.’ (Incidentally, this clause except
the last four words,  omitted from the article as pleaded in the
petition, page 11%).

There are several. reasons why we cannot consider the amount to be
awarded the Osage on the basis of the treaty provisions set forth in
the next preceding paragraph. In the first place such a claim was never
submitted to us either by pleading or proof at the origzlnal trial, nor
were such contentions, as are novzumade, presented to the Court of Claims

on appeal. It is elementary that our functions are limited to carrying

_.—._—au..-. .-o—.—...---_.c-q:.——--n.-—.__. ..._. -. .

out the directions of that court and they are,‘ as we have stated above,
to determine the value as the Osage lands as of September 29. 1865; that,
in ;act, is the only purpose for 1d:ich- the remand me made.“ It would

be intermeddling with the court's mandate for us to ignore it by reconsidering the case on snentirely new theory of liability. (eee'3 Am.

%Jp.r. 733-731;, Section 1237; se Sanford re:-L: etc... 1601!. 3. 21:7) for,

as shown in the Saniord Pork case, no question once considered Joy an
appellate court can be re-examined at any-subsequent state of the same
case.; But even were we‘ to consider the value on the so-cal1eds"orderly
sale basis.‘ contended for by’ petitioner. the proof offered is so speculative and theoretical. in character it could not form the basis for an

Petitioner has presented evidence of value throughthree recognized

8PPra1sers, Hr. William D. mvis, Mr. Watson 1.. Bowen and 14:‘. George L.

, Schnmtz. W. D. Davis and II. A. Bowen prepared extensive appraisal reports

which were received in evidence. Mr. Schnutz testified as  expert
witness ‘based upon a study of these reports. Ehe petitioner also presented
the testimony of Dr. Le Duo as a historical. expert and his study was also
used by the appraisers for petitioners. Defendant was represented by two
recognized appraisers. Hr. H. C. Brady. who prepared a valuation study
which is in evidence, and Mr. Richard sen. both of when testified. The
appraisal reports are volundnous but have been thoroughly analyzed.

Both parties gree that ‘the fair actual value“ used in the court's
opinion, means the fair mmket value as of September 29, 1855. The appraisers for both parties accept the definition of market value as stated

ning the value as of 1565. That definition is:

"Earket price is the highest price estimated in terms of
money which land will bring if exposed for sale in the open
market with a reasonable time allowed to find a purchaser
Tmy"...ngwith knowledge of all the uses and purposes to which
it is ‘best adapted and for which it is capable of being used.“

The appraisers, except hr. Schmntz for petitioner, also agree that
the tract‘s highest and best use as of 1365 would he that of subdivision

into subsistence farmsteads. ‘_

The appraisers, however, disagree on the methods to be used in “arriv_ing at the market value of these lands as of 1865. may all agree that the

market data approach is an acceptable approach but they disagree as to the
utilization of certain of the market data material‘.

Mr. Davis‘ report appears as petitioner's exhibits 100 and 101. hr.
B01788’ report is contained in petitioner‘:-3 exhibits S9 and 90. Mr. Davis
relies on tho approaches, the market data and the Earnings Approach, to l
arrive at the market value as of 1865, Bones uses two methods to ascertain the market value, the Comparison Approach (which is the same as
market data), and the productivity approach which is, he says, an adaptation of the capi talization approach. .

the reports of Mr. Davis and Er. Bowes contain much identical material
used in arriving at that in their opinion was the fair market value of the
Osage Ceded lands as of 1865'. For this reason they will he considered together as far as possible. They both analyze a nmber of small sales,
some 2693-}, in nine counties in and near the Osage tract. These sales of

small tracts were made between the years 1858 throng: 3.869. The same _

sales are used in each of the reports. In the reports the sales are
numbered and show the date- of sale, the-consideration paid, the legal
description of the lands, @ether the lands were assessed, and if so,
the assessed value per acre for a date later than the sale, and a notation whether the lands were improved or unimproved. Although these

~ sales are for the most part indicated in the reports to be improved or

unimproved. the appraisers in adjusting the average Price of these sales

to arrive at a per acre value as of 1865 consider them all to be im. proved and use a flat figure per acre (91% cents for Davis and $1.00 for

Bones) to adjust for improvements. D

Defendant obiected to the use of these sales of small tracts -for a
number of reasons. Defendant introduced evidence -(Def. Eats. 141, 3-L2, 743,
145 and 14-7), which shows that it was impossible to tell from the tax and
assessment records of the counties wherein the sales too}: place whether
land was improved or unimproved. Defendant further points to 581% sales
in the two reports where the notation as to 1d~.ether the land was improved or pnimproved has been changed in one report and not in the other.

Defendant further objected to ‘these sales because many of them were
multiple sales of the samskpiece of property" or parts of the same property which would distort the average and show incomparability to the
Osage lands. That there are many multiple sales is graphically shown on
the township plats introduced in evidence by defendant pith the sales
numbers noted thereon.

(See Def. Ems. 1.11%, 1&7 through 514}.

If, however. the appraisers for petitioner were correct in their

methods of adjusting for improvements after assuming all the lands involved

q.

in the small sales were improved, then the above objections of defendant
would-_-be less convincing. Therefore, we will see how each appraiser
adjusted for improvements and why defendant objected.

Mr. Davis in his report used the 1900 census nhich showed the value

of land and value of the buildings on all farms in each of the nine

counties studied by him. To obtain a percentage figure to show what the

total land value was he divided the landvalue estimated into the total

of the ‘building and land value estimated. This percentage figure was

_ then applied to the total volume of his “free sales“ abstracted in each

countvfor each year to arrive at the value of the land unimproved. On
this computation he concluded that 91! cents per'acre ‘was the value of

the improvements on his 2696 Free Sales. '£his sum he deducted from the -3.."
average selling price of these sales to obtain the $34.28 average for them.
as unimproved.

Defendant objected to theuse of the census figures pointing out that
no consideration was given by witness to the fact that the lend itself
might have many improvements such as being plot.-ed, fenced and wells dug.
(Def. 31'. P. -29). In addition, petitioner‘s witness Le Due, on crossexamination (T. 1h9o-ingh) and on direct examination (T. 11:76-11:78),
stated that the Census never attempted to separate the value of fixed
improvements such as ploughing and clearing, and so on from the land,
and that the only separation of realty values that was made was between
buildings on the one hand. and land. with fixed improvements on the other.

In view of the above, it is evident that the use of the 1900 -Census

figures to arrive at a percentage of the value of improvements as to the

ounus . n In-1

—-—.- ;f'_;_i___H ,_, __, . ,"____ _'__ '

-—----——I-u- 4...:-u._s-..-4.-u 4.. »

value of nalced land would not be a proper method to he, followed.
_ _ Er. Bowes, ‘on the other hand, used other methods of adjusting for

improvements. First, he studied the affidavitsd of 23 entrymen from among

those made under Article 1% of the Treatyof September 29, 1855. These

affidavits mre dated from February 2,1868 tolseptember 2, l869. Under

_this article persons who were living at the time of the treaty on the

Osage Coded lands and who had made improvements thereon were given the

privilege of purchasing-a quarter section at $1.25 per acre. From an

.exemination of these affidavits he concluded that the improvements

averaged 92 cents per acre.

Fith: respect to these improvements it must he said that they are
hardly comparable with the sales of patented lands outside the Osage Be-5
servation. Many of the sales of small tracts enumerated in these reports‘
were made in counties long organized, Allen County':wa.s organized in 1855
and so were hourhon and Hoodson. As stated hef ore, many of the sales
were listed as multiple sales of the some property or parts of the same _
property. The _town of Emboldt, for instance, in..A.llen County just north
of the Ceded lands, was laid out in. 1557 and in 3.859 it was reported ‘by
the surveyors to he in a flourishing condition with two stream saw mills

and 130 dwelling houses. The surveyors further reported that township to

be well settled even at that early date. '

Br. Bowes' second method of detemning a. per acre price to adjust
for improvements is based upon the a.ppraiser‘s report with respect to the
Cherokee Neutral Lands. The improved lands on the Cherokee tract totaled

2S.3'{9 acres with total value of improvements found to be $590,905. Bones

585's therefore the value of the improvements in 1867 amounted to 71!» cents

an acre. He gets this by dividing $590,905 into the total acreage of the

Cher°ke9 Reutral tract: 799.5l1’«.72 acres. This method is so obviously

wrong on its face that no more  be said about it. The actual fact

is that thevalue of the improvements of the 28,379 acres were in excess

°f % P81‘ acre. How this fact as applied to the rest of the unimproved

Cherokee tract is comparable with the improvements on the 2600 small

tracts is beyond logical reasoning.

Another method Bowes used to adjust for improvements involved the

_ appraisal of the Delaware lands in,K'ansas to be ceded to the United States

Under the 533333? 0f May 30,. 1860. In this respect he also studiednthe

' 8-Ppraisal made of improvements on land belonging to the Kansas Indians in’

1352. In 28 of these appraisals he found the average value of improvements 15° be $1-09 P31‘ 8-019. andezcluding one parcel containing a. store

it amounted to 71% cents per acre. Sufficient information was not contained in his report to  the Kansas Indian appraisals but from petitioner's _E;hi'bit 99 -- the appraisal of improvements belonging to the
Delaware Indians and Def. Ex. 341 in‘ Dockets 15-B andzlll which contains

the full appraisal report on the Delaware lands in 1861, including the unimproved lands a. different picture is presented. Ihe unimproved lands were
3-PPI'a-i33d- 3-3 $1.50. $1.05 and 80 cents per acre. For example, the B?! 1/1!» of

5‘3°- 5. T12  was appraised unimproved at $1.50 per acre and the appraiser

noted that improvements were "on the land. Een since these improvements had

3° be 8PE>ra.ised separately they found that '{ acres of the tract had heen

cultivated and fenced and gave a value to these 7 acres of $3.50 per acre

or $214.50 3‘) or the 7 acres of improved land. This would bean increase of

$2.00 per acre for improvements for cultivation and fencing alone without

taking into consideration other improvements.‘
As said previously, Mr. Box-res made a study of 28 of these tracts
(presumably Delaware and some Kansas Indian appraisal) which he says

totaled 110014 acres with improvement value of $11398. Again he is com?paring lands as far as imprpyements are‘ concerned that seem-hardly

Similar. At least the Delaware improved lands were Indian allotments on

their reservation with few acres under cultivation and other minor Indian

improvements. To assume that the lands held ‘by settlers in the nine

u counties studied contained percentage wise the same type of improvements

at the time of the sale of the small tracts wound _be.arbitr\wy and unfounded in the light of the history of the settlement in the areas ad-t
joining the Usage ceded lands to the north.

Hr. Bowes says his third method of adjusting for improvements is
based upon the assessmnt records for l7;'sa.les'in Woodson County.‘ These
constituted a total of 2601 acres. This total assessed value of land and
"improvements, he says . was $12,816.; The total assessed value of improvements was $2756. This amounts to $l.O5i‘or improvementsi _s_De£endant
introduced the testimony of itsiexpertappraiser Mr. Richard Hell (T.l2921397) who stated that he had examined «the tax and assessment records of
Hoodson County  that he -could not tell from the records on file in the
county seat" vzhether the land was improved or unimproved. Defendant offered

its Exhibit #3 which verifies this statement and Defendant's Exhibit H7,

; ‘No conclusions-ith respect to the value per acre of the Osage ceded

indicate a demand and a market for land in the immediate vicinity of the

Osage Geded tract prior to, at the time of, and subsequent to the Treaty

- of September 29, 3.865, and do show that wall tracts of land,-many of

which were undoubtedly improved, were selling in 1865 for an average consideration of‘$1_l_;.38 an acre.;j (Bones Report, Pet.-Ex. A-88, p. 81).

p In his Eomparison Approach, ‘besides the private sales of wall
tracts, III. Bones has three sections. She second section is devoted to

In his Market Data Approach, Mr. Davis has-a section on “Sales of

look at these sales under the headings proposed by Mr. Bones.

5&5 OF STATE LEEDS -  

Kansas received some 500,000‘-acres of _‘'Internal Improvements” lends
when admitted into the Union. (12 Stat. l26) They were selected in
1861 ‘by three commissioners and wereallocated-‘by act of the Kansas
legislature on-Eebruary 23, l866 to four railroads; the Leavenworth,
Lawrence and Galveston, the Kansas and Neosho Valley,‘ the Northern
Kansas and the Union Pacific Southern Branch. The State started. to sell
theaalands at $1.25 ner acre (minimum statutory price), but the railroads
complained that this was less than their market value and the State
turned-the remainder of_ the lands over to the railroads at minimum price.

The Kansas and Heosho Valley Railroad received 89., 690 acres which it

Le Duo consider the school sales outside but near the Ceded tract for the

an average of about $1L.38. These lands were north of the ceded tract.

some 314,000"-acres of land within the ‘ceded tract as school lands. These
_were sold at an average of $3-.1!-0 per acre ‘out some of'~the sales were not
made until the late 1870's and early 1880's. Up through the y'ear_-1872,
28,210 acres had been sold for an average of $3.26 per acre. Apparently,

there is an inadvertent discrepancy ‘between the school land figures -used
by Mr. Bones and Mr‘. Davis with respect to the school lands:-’i§d;th.in the ‘.

sisting of 208 tracts for $176,696, onterms, at an average of $6.01;
per acre and had collected $1r{,197 by that time’. ~ :

The following facts of record should be noted in taking into consideration the sales of railroad lands within the Ceded tract. The LLG
selected 176,052,149 acres within the area and sales started in October
1371. Up through 1873 only l3,1¥0O acres had been sold at ‘an average
price of $6.90 per acre, and l2,0’-$0 of these were on liberal terms and
by 1873 only one-sixth of the purchase price had been received. Only
1360 acres had been sold for cash at an average price of $5.29.

The '_'Katy" railroad had selected 282,830.86 acres within theosage
ceded tract and jcp to February 28, 1871! had sold only 29,263.71 acres
for $176,696 on terms at an average price of $6.01} per acre, and had

collected but $147,197 by that time.

These facts in themselves vronld indicate that the price of railroad lands even on liberal terms was too high to move the land fast and
that the mlonvnt of cash purchases was negligible.

Witness for defendant, Mr. Brady, points out (T. 1165-1172) that c.‘

study of railroad sales must include more than just an examination of the

early sales by the railroads for as the choice lands are taken and cancel-‘
lations talce place the average price received by these railroads decline.
Although the record is far from -complete with respect to the yearly
sales by these railroads the figures available for the sales ‘by the "~Ka_ty"
within and without the Ceded tract illustrate the above point.
In 1871 the "Katy" sold 138,855 acres (which may include both Congressional grant and Internal Improvements lands) _for an average of $5.08.
In 1872, it reported it had sold 157,72’-$.29 acres of Congressianal grant
lands up to that time at an average of $4.75. In 1873 it reported the
sale of an additional hh,lh0.65 acres_o£g_Gongessiona,1 gent lands at_
$14.37 average. (Pet. Ex...£.-88, Le Duo, p. 71). In Defendant's ‘Exhibit

In 1876 $2,831.22 acres-average

In 1877 76,691!» acres-average 2.22

The record. of sale of the railroad. land's within the ceded area has
little utility in.ascertaining the fair;market'valne of the Osage Ceded
tract as of_§eptember 29, 1865. i

Ehe best evidence ofgvalne in this case as to the market value of
the Osage Coded tract as of Septem12eri29, 1865, are the appraisals and
sales previously mentioned, of Indian reservation lands in the State of
Kansas in the 1869's, especially the appraisal and sale of the Cherokee
Feutral Lands which adjoined the Osage ceded tract on the east. Many of
these Indian sales were in areas north of the Ceded tract  closer to

centers of population. On the other hand, there were also sales of surplus

instances at the appraised figure. All of these sales of Indian reservation lands in the 1860's do indicate avalue in excess of $1.00 per

Osage_Ereaty of September 29, 1865. The average valuation for the unoccupied lands within the Neutral tract, 'appraised'in 1866 and 1867, was _

approximately $1.340 per acre. The Neutral area totaled approximately .

Because of the slightly higher qualities of soils. in the subject land,

it was concluded  on these data “alone the value indicated for the
subject property was between $1.60 and $1.70 per acre as of 1855.“

This conclusion of Watson Bot-es is subject to his figure that the area

was appraised at $1.50 per acre for the whole tract rather than the $1.3-LO

  I’ Their vies-as clash, however, with respect to which part of the transaction,

that is, the appraisal or the sale‘, is to be controlling.

  Homally, an appraiser would consider the sales price of a comparable

‘ _ piece of property in ascertaining the fair market value of the property
he was appraising. Ea appraisers for petitioner, however, attach more

weight to the appraisal of the Cherokee Neutral Lands for the reason set

-.-.a..A.nn.nu ll.-u

forth ‘by Mr- Schmntz that “because of the conditions surrounding that

3 l5?
transaction [the sale to Jog that is, the scandal which apparently
was created--— I am of the opinion that the price was not indicative of
a fair market value, and for that did not take it into consideration.‘

The facts of the sale of the Cherokee Neutral Lands in a. body briefly
are these:'_ ‘Under Article l‘[ of the treaty the Secretary of the Interior
was authorized. tolsell the whole of the lands not occupied by actual
settlers at the date of ratification of the treaty in a body to a. re.»
Bponsible party for cash for a ‘sum not less than $1.00 per acre. Shortly
after the treaty; of July 19, 1866, with the Cherokees, ‘that is on Awust
30, .1366, the Secretary of the. Interior, Harlan, negotiatedithe sale of
these lands to the American Emigrantlcompany on terms. This was the day
before Harlan resiged as Secretary. This contract mas‘ declared illegal
by the attorney. General in that it did not call for'ca;.sh. In 186?, ;Jo_y
made an offer to ‘buy the lands on tame. '_ Ehe Emigrant Company assigned
.'_Lt:-:~ rights to Joy.- Brady (Def,  36, Sec. VI. p. 12) states the Cherokee
delegation in ‘B'ashington_-approved thejassignment in a. letter to the Commissioner of IIld.ia.‘I1_‘Aff&1I'B, dated February 13, 1857, stating they prefetred to dispose of the land in a. body at a. mailer price rather than to

have it picmd and called over. This transaction ‘was. approved by the

one:-ezeeee by the_-_ Treaty of April 27, 1563, 16 Stat. 727,,i1_~mepp. 996.
lfollowing the original treaty of 1865 and before the purchase by Joy,

settlers 1 gen to_ move on to the Neutral Lands. Joy turned over the
lands to his railroad, the Missouri, Fort Scott and Gulf. The settlers

expected to obtain tn lands at government prices or as homesteads. They

were incensed at the sale of these lands to the railroad. Armed violence

crmted. Government troops weresent to the tract. Joy, in trying to
placate these settlers,~had his appraiser appraise these lands ofjthe
settlers at a minimum of $2 and a maximum of $5. In 1869, an office was
opened for the sale;-to these settlers @on proof of settlement and upon
terms. me aggregate sales to this class of purchasers, included all
sales prior to  23,‘ 1870, totaled 117,752.96 acres..,_at an average price
'54‘? $14.30. The only ether evidence with respect to this sale to Joy is to
'_b_e_ found in Le Ducted report, Petitioner's Exhibit A-88, in which-he recites
many of the facts with respect to the trouble with the settlers and cites
a letter from_the Governor or ‘Kansas, Crawford. dated January 1, 1867, to
Sloan, ‘calling the sale to Joy of the Cherokee lands an infamous fraud
upon the settlers. _' - I ' ' " ~

These are .’the condit ions surrounding that transaction--that is,_v the
scandal‘-which apparently was created.'? There is no proof of record to
show the sale to Joy to be fraudulent unless as the Governor of Kansas
says it bras affraud upon the settlers who preferred to obtainthe land
from the Government rather than_the railroad. There is no evidence of
record that the Cherokees ever complained gf being overreached. To the
contrary, the only mentionof Cherokee reaction is contained‘ in Brady's
report to the effect that the Cherokees preferre d. to. sell the land in
balk at a smaller price rather than have it picked and culled over.

It is_true that only the Emigrant Company and 103’ were offering to
buy the land at $1.00 per acre. There is no evidence, however, that any

other person or company was so inclined to purchase 539.658 acres of land

or was refused an opportunity to bid on them.

two-year period had expired, 3365' ciaims had been filed. Under this Joint

Resolution 3. total of 33S,6O1$.53 acres were sold to 2295 persons at $1.25
per acre. _The total acreage thus disposed at was practically all that
was available for sale--the remaining acreage having been disposed of by
railroad, school and treaty grants.

These facts definitely disclose that the ‘settlers believed that the
 oi‘_the Osage Ceded tract at $1.25 per acre was a bargain. The.
facts disclose also that there was a demand for the lands within the
ceded tract that would indicate a value in excess of the government mini;
mum price__of $1.25 per acre. ‘ ' _ .

In view of_these facts it is evident that the value of the Osage
Coded tract as of September 29, 1865, would havabeen at least equal to
the appraised value of the Cherokee Eeutral unoccupied lands or $1.3-IO
an acre. In addition. the Osage lands @pear to have been slightly
better lands than those of the Cherokees for agriculturalpurposes and
no lands had been sold to gett1ers._. The Osage lands had the advantage
of being watered by the Heosho River and 11:3. tributaries and being with-L
in the drainage system of the Verdigris Riverowhich rims e short distance
rest of the rest _boundary.of the Osage Ceded tract. ‘latson Eowes, in
comparing the two properties, indicated an additional 10 cents or 20

cents per acre value for the Osage lands as compared to the Cherokee

lands .

ihe only remaining question to be considered in valuing the. Osage

ceded tract as oi’ September 29, 1865. is the problem of whether or not

C the value should be enhanced because of. the proposed construction of a

railroad through the tract.

By the set of March 3. 1863, 12 Stat. 772. the United States made
a grant of public lands to the State of Kansas of alternate sections
desiaated by odd nmbers. to aid in the construction of certain railroads and telegraphs in that state, one of which was to be a railroad

from the City of Leavenworth by way of the town of Lawrence and via the
Ohio City crossing of the Usage River to the southernuline of the state

in the direction of Galveston Bay in Texas. The grant was the odd sections
oflland for ten sections in width on each side of said road. If the lands
on each side of the road had been previously sold, reserved or otherwise
appropriated. or were ‘subject to homestead or preemption rights, then the
Secretaxyui the Interior would select other public lands of equal quantity
for the railroad within twenty miles of the line of the railroad. The act
further provided that no lands were to be granted until 20 consecutive
miles of the road had been completed and then the state was permitted to

sell all the lands granted situated opposite to. and within a limit of

ten miles of the section of road completed.

The Leavenworth, Lawrence and Galveston Railroad. which was eventually
to obtain lands under the 1863 Act, was incomorated in l35S.___ (Brady Re-L
port. Def. Ex. 35. ‘VI - p. 23). Its road was laid out on paper practically

as-"the road runs today except that it was turned westward in actual consstruction to go through Eontgomery County instead of into Labette County.

'\

The legislature of Kansas on January 9, 1861?», passed an act accepting
the grant shes: the Act of Congress of harsh 3, 1863. and designated the

Finding No. 13 and on page-lO'{'to page 13.0, inclusive, of its brief. In
a nutshell. defendant‘s position is that a purchaser would have had to

induce a railroad to build into the area or would have had to build the

railroad himself. In its brief . defendant urges that nowhere in their

testimony have the appraisers for petitioner made adjustments for the
effect of railroads on values of the sales considered by these appraisers.
The petitioner's position is set forth in its objection to defends.nt‘s

proposed findings. pages 65 and 66 of the reply brief.‘ In effect petitioner argues that the railroad wcguld have beenconstructed without a

grant from the Government. The prime consideration of two railroads for

‘building through the Osage tract was to connect by a free right of way
through the Indian Territory.‘ Ieither of these railroads, the__"Katy'_‘ or
the Iansaspand Neosho Valley. (later the Jiissouri.‘ Fort Scott and Gulf)
were proposed through the Osage tract in 1865. ‘

All of thsdiscussions with respect to the enhancement of the Osage
Coded tract by virtue of the proposed railroad seem to beg the real
question. "Thatis, should the talue of the Osage Ceded tract _as of
September 29, 1865, be enhanced by the prospect of the construction of a
railroad at a future date through the_lands7

In yaluing these Osage landsas. of September 29, 1865. we are attempt-L
ing to ascertain their fair market value as of that date. If the United
States is to be found liable for the value of the lands as of that date
then the facts of howledge at that time sho_u_ld .control._

By the Act of March 3, 1863. the Government made a grant of public

lands to Kansas to aid in the construction of a railroad wmch would pass

through what became the Osage ceded tract. In 18614. the Kansas legislature
passed an act acceptingothe grant under the 1863 act and designated the
Leavenworth. Lawrence and Galveston to build the road and to receive the
land on the prescribed terms.

as of the date of the Treaty of. September 29, T1865. therefore, the_

railroad existed on paper only.“ The railroad did not file a map -showing

it

. its route until Eovember 1866 and then only‘? to the; northern boundary of J

the ceded tract. No construction had been undertaken and as late as
November 1567 only one mile south of Ottawa had been completed.

So. as of the date of thetreaty, the officials of the ‘United States
met. or should have known. at the Act of 1363 granting to Kansas public
lands to aid in_the construction of a railroad through the Osage ceded
tract. They should have known of the act of the Kansas legislature accept-'-O
ing the grant __in 18634 and designating the Leavenworth, Lawrence and
Galveston Railroad to build the line. These officials would also have
known that no construction wor}: had been started and no maps of definite
location filed with the Government._ They would also have realized that the
Osage ceded tract urior to the Treaty were reserved lands and not subject
to the grant of the Act of 1363 while the __land_.s remained as part of the
Indian reservation. They would also realize that if and when Indian title
was extinguished and the lands became public lands, said tract would be
subject to the grant iade in the 1863 Act.

Prior to the treaty, it is difficult to say that the railroad through"

the Osage ceded tract was more than a possibility. Its completion depended

.-I«--. ....a ..4-.t....p . ..

. I . , -_.. ' -._,
-I-«-oar...-a ... ta.-, .,....o..._ ,_, H ;',;.,_v

upon the occurrence of certain events: first, the acquisition of land

or rights-of-waythrough the Osage ceded tract. This could only be
accomplished through a treaty made with the Osages by the United States.
“Second, the actual construction of the railroad itself. Since at the
date of the treaty no construction had been undertaken. it must be said

that it was only possible that the routewould be undertaken. As the

Supreme Court said  Olson 1?. United States, 292 U. S. 255, 78 L. ed.

i 1216: "

"Elements affecting value that depend uponaevients or combinations of occurrences which. while within the realm of‘

possibility. are not fairly shown to be reasonably probable,
should be excluded from consideration for that would be to

allow mere speculation and conjecture to become a guide for
the ascertainment of value—-U-a thing to be condemned in
business transactions as well as in Judicial ascertainment

of truth. 3

It is true that if, as one must assume in fixing the valuation as

of September 29, 1865, the United gtates acquired title to the coded tract

in 1865, then it would be reasonably probable that the railroad would pass

through the Geded tract. The Government was comitted by the 1363 act

to grant the public lands along the proposed route tolthe railroad. Upon

acquisition of these lands in l865,- they would have become public lands
subject to_the grant. Under these circumstances would the Osages-be

entitled to an increment of value accruing to their lands because the

United States ma committed itself to grant some of these lands to aid in

the construction of a railroad over the tract?
The answer to that-. question it is believed is contained in the

317 U. s. 369%,

decision of the Supreme Court in United States v. Miller,

In United Statesv. Miller, suora, the Government condemied a strip

g..   

zacross respondents‘ lands for the tracks-of a railroad which were to be

a reclamation project. This project in the vicinity of respondents‘

lands had been under consideration for many years and in 19,35 the President approved construction of the project. Congress appropriated. money

In June 1937, the,Secretary
oi’ the Interior stated that Shasta. California. had been selected for the
site of the Sacramentohiver dam which involved relocation of the line of
Portions of respondents’ lands were required for the relocated right-of-way. - Alternate routes ‘were surveyed by March 1936 and

staked at intervals of 100 feet.

In December of 1938, a complaint in ezninen~t:"'domain against respondents

and others was filed and a declaration of taking was filed on that day.

Witnesses were asked to state theircpinion as to market value of the land

taken as at December 11%, 1938, the date of filing of the complaint. Government counsel objected on the groundthat, as the mited States was definitely committed to the project on August 26, 1937, the respondents were not

entitled to have included in an estimate of value. as of the date the lands

were taken. any increment of value due to _the Gov_ernment‘s authorization

"T.he*»question thenf-is whetherrtheoréspondents' lands
were probably within the scope of the project from the
time the Government was committed to it. If they were not,
but were merely adjacent lands. the subsequent enlargement
of the project to include them ought not to deprive the
respondents of the value added in the meantime by proximity
of the improvement. If, on the other hand, they were, the
Government ought not to pay any increase in value aris ing
from the ‘lndown fact that the lands probably would be condemned. The owners ought not to gain by speculating on
probable increasein value due to the G-overnment‘s activities.

‘In which category do the lands. in question fall? _The
project. from the date of its final and definite authorization
in_August 1937, included the relocation of the railroad right. of-way, and one probable route was marked out rm er the respondents' lands. This being so. it was proper to tell the
jury that the respondents were entitled to no increase in
value arising after August 1937 because of the likelihood of
the taking of their property. If their lands were probably
to be taken for public use, in order to complete the project
in its entirety, any increase in value due to that fact could
only arise from speculation by them, or by possible purchasers —

from them. as to what the Government would be compelled to pay
as compensation.“ ' « ' 

In view of the evidence on value offered by the parties, much of
which was not presented to the Commission at the fomer hearing in this
case, we conclude that the lands. involved in this case had a market
value of $1.50 per acre on September 29, 1865, the date of the grant and
sale to the ‘Cinited ‘States. The disparitw between the purchase‘ price of
about 31!» cents per acre and the value  $1.50 ‘per acre. as of the £18358
of the treaty, constitutes in our opinion an unconscionable consideration

under the provisions of the Indian Claimscommission Act.

. Acreage Purchased

 

When we originally considered this case we found (Eiuding 543.) the
acreage of the area purchased to be 865,930.31. This figure was based

is we have found. the Osage lands within the boundaries of the grant

Indians contend’ that under the provisions of said article the entire
acreage was directed to be surveyed and sold and therefore the award must
‘be for the entire acreage. It is_ true that Article 1. if considered alone,
would lend support to the Osage contention ‘but it is elementary law that a
contract such as this must be interpreted by considering and giving effect
to all its provisions. Applying this rule to the treaty hereunder con-9
sideration it will ‘be seen that partoof the acreage granted by said article
was not intended to be sold as public lands ‘but were to ‘be given or sold
to others. The Osage recognize this rule, for they concede that donations
of ishas provided for in subsequent articles or the treaty. donations to
the catholic Mission. the Mograin heirs and the series heirs (about 159lt.2lx-9
acres) should not be included in the acreage to he compensated for. The

change in terms. But why mist there be a change (revision)
ofterms in order to grant relief where unconscionable consideration is the basis for relief? The clause in effect, if not
expressly. permits a recovery for the difference between the
value and the unconscionable price paid. “So why should we
judicially direct the useless ceremony of revising a contract
long sincé performed in an attempt to bring our acts within the

judicial action would be fictional and not in keeping with the

(or contract or agreement) must be involved to bring it within
the scope of clause (3) and, in most cases, to show the consideration, but a claim for the difference between the value and an
unconscionable consideration is not here based on the treaty but
@on the statute, _clause (3), and the claimant would make out a

prima facie case by showing it had Indian title to the lands, that

it ceded them by treaty, the consideration paid and proof that the

Dissaiting opinion of chief commissioner Witt

The question to be determined by the Commission at this time is
the amount of the award to be made to petitioner. In the determination
of this question it is necessary to first determine the basis of de-.
fendanti s liability and the amount of acreage involved.

I cannot agree with the basis of liability as determined by wt

colleagues, ‘nor as to the acreage involved, nor entirely with their

viewpoint as to evidence to be considered in determining the value of

the land even on the basis upon which they determined the same; hence,

‘H this opinidn of dissent.

The petitioner, upon the trial oi‘. this case_ after its remand by
the Court of Claims, for the first time urged damagesbasedbn a 
of liability by reason of the-failure of the defendant to sell said
lands in accordance with the provisions of, the”trea.ty, and no evidence
was introduced in the original -trial in support of suchxt-theory of
liability. L V

It was only fo]_'Lov._ring the retzand of this case,  upon a retrial
thereof, and on Hovember 5, 1952, when ‘testimony was offered by ps- .
titioner! s witness Bowes in support of suchtheory of liability, at
which time petitioner indicated its claim of right to such measure of.
damages. To this line of testmony the defendant objected, contending
that same was a new cause of action and was  by sec. l2 of the
Indian claims Commission not. Petitioner contended that it had the
right to assert such measure of damges by reason of the language in

ts original petition wherein it was asserted that the facts in said

lands without the payment therefor of Ijust compensation agreed to

by the petitioners! Petitioner requested, however, that it be allowed

to amend said petition and it was granted the right to amend the same,
and thereafter an amendment was allowed and the petitioner permitted to

add after the word Hpetitionert! in the above quotation the following
lie;

"' "' "' which was the amount for which the lands
should. have sold had the Government observed

the treaty requirements in disposing of the
ceded lands.

Another amendment was requested and allowed wherein the petitioner
was permitted to pray "for an awardifor the amount which should have
been deposited in the civilization md had the United states observed

the treaty requirements and disposed of the land according to the terms

01‘ the treaty. In the alternative, petitioner prays for an award for

the fair actual value of the  as of the date of the treaty.”

Ehe treaty involved in this 'liti@.tion was dated September 29 ,

1865, and it providescompensation for the lands ceded in the following
language appearing in Article 1, to-‘wit;

"‘ "' “ And, in consideration of the land and sale to V
them of the above-described lands, the United states

It is undisputed that the lands were not sold in the manner provided by the treaty. It is not material to the issue under consideration
to go into the manner said lands actually were sold. by the defendant. The
defendant, as previously stated, contends that the petitioner is not entitled to a recovery based on what the lands might have sold for if disposed of in accordance with the terms of the treaty, -- that the petitioner

. is precluded from asserting such basis of liability because itdid not
assert such measure of liability prior to August 13, 1951. The defendant
contends that the only basis of liability that can be considered by the
Comission is the market value of the tract involved as a unit as of the
date of the treaty --I and this is the basis of liability considered by my
colleagues. , ' * .

gs previously stated, liability based on the. failure of the defendant

to sell the lands involved in accordance with the provisions of the treaty
was not .-urged in the trial of -the case prior to its appeal and not until
the trial subseopent thereto; however, the original petition setpout in
haec verba the provisions of the treaty, including the previously pioted
terms upon which the land should be sold, and alleged said lands were

- sold for much less than their true value, and Ithat the facts alleged * ‘F *
prove a claim arising from the taking by the United states as a result of

petitioner to have agreed. to such compensation in order to be entitled
thereto -- such compensation accrues as a matter of law. Therefore, the
writer thinks the prayer for Ejust compensation agreed to by the petitionerft encompasses the relief for which petitioner now prays - that

is, the proceeds of the sale of the lands involved in accordance with

the terms agreed to ‘bylthe petitioner "and defendant in Article 1 of the

treaty . ,

' Ehe writer is constrained to take this view because of the well established rule of law that the bar of a statute of limitation is a harsh

one and that pleadings should be liberally construed to prevent its

amli cati on .

The qiestion whether an amendment to a pleading, relates
back to the bringing of the suit, for determining the application of the statute of limitations, depends principally upon
the nature of the matter asserted by the amendment, -— whether
the amendment states a new éause of action or merely restates
in different form the cause of action stated in the original
pleading. An amendment to the plaintiff's declaration, complaint, or petition, so long as it does not introduce a new
cause of action or make any new demand or substantially change
the cause of action, but merely restates in a different form
the canoe of action originally pleaded, relates back to the
comencement of the action so as to avoid the operation of
the statute of limitations, and may therefore be made even I
after the statute of limitations has run. Under this rule,
there an amendment to the plaintiffls pleading is properly
allowed, so far as regards the statute of limitations it will
have the same effect as if his pleading had been properly filed
in the amended. form at the comencement of the suit. (31% Am. J‘D.r.,
PP; 213.’  H '

Hush latitude of amendment is properly allowed to save the
cause of action, if possible, from the bar of limitation. It
has been suggested that courts should be inclined to disregard
subtleties and answer technical objections to__ the sufficiency
of a pleading in an honest effort to determine the real issues
on their merits, and to try to do substantial justice to the

litigants before them. (33-!- Am. J‘L11'., 13. 211+).

Moreover, it is well recognized that a cause of action is based
on facts alleged and not the prayer for relief.

My colleagues in the majority opinion of the Commission seem to
base their holding that the petitioner is not now entitled to assert
a measure of damages based on the failure of the defendant to sell the
land as agreed to in the treaty because it did not urge suchmeasure
and that the holding of
the court of claims that petitioner is entitled to recover on the basis
then urged precludes the assertion upon the new trial of the case before
the Indian claims‘ commission. of any different measure of damages. It is
to be noted, however, that the defendant does not make  such contention as a ground. for denying the right to assert said measure of

damages, but relies solely on its plea of limitation;
It is the viewpoint of the writer that only the holdings of the

Court of claims as to the matters that were before it are binding upon
the Indian claims commission upon the trial of the case after remand.
The measure of damages urged upon the second trial - even though under
the pleadings it might have been urged upon the first trial — it ‘was
not then urged -- and the right to mintain same was therefore not
passed upon by the court of claims. while the urging of said measure
of damges upon a retrial was not based upon assertion of a new cause
of action (so the writer thinks), it was based upon more detailed. allegations as permitted by the amendmentsto the original petition —- and
therefore the right to urge said different measure of damages is

somewhat aualagous to the right to amend pleadings. The Federal Rules

of Procedure (28 USGA, Rides l and 15) authorize amended pleadings even

The importance of the measure of damagesis due ‘to the-. difference
in the value of the acreage involved as of the date of the treaty as a
single tract and the amount said land would have sold. for to settlers in
small tracts as provided for by said treaty. The defendant asks for a
finding of fact «that the fair market value of the osage ceded area on
September , 1865 was 1!-5 cents an acre”; and for a finding of fact

that Gander an orderly sales program the Osage ceded lands, without a

railroad,-‘would not have brought, -on the average, more than $1.25 per

acre.“ 33' such requested findings the defendant in effect admits that

the land would have sold in mil tracts under an orderly sales program

(that is, sold  accordance with the terms of the treaty) for almost

three times the amount t would have sold for in ‘bulk as a single ract.

(See Defendantis Request for Eindings, no. 88, 89).

In discussing the evidence as to sales in small tracts of land

within the Osage ceded area to actual settlers, defendant says that the

evidence offered by the petitioner shows !!that unimproved school lands
within the Osage ceded area. sold for only $3.31; in 1870, $3.23 in 1871,
and $3.08 in 1872." nerehhaht further says as to said evidence; nu:
sales of small tmcts have any probative value in a case of this kind
these sales reveal that five, six, and seven years after the cession
 and after the ‘coming of the railroads small tracts were worth only
$3.26 on the average.” (see Deftis. objections to Find. of Fact Requested by the Eetitioner, p. 1+9) .
That the petitioner would have received. as the proceeds of the
sale of the lands had theybeen sold. Eon the most advantageous terms,
for cash, as public lands are surveyed and sold under existing laws,
and no preemption or homestead settlement recognized,“ (as provided by
the treaty), at least twice, if not three times as much as the land
could have been_sold for as a whole in bulk is in effect admtted by
defendant - therefore, the importance of the measure of damages to be
applied in “determining the award to which petitioner is entitled.
In Messinger vs. Anderson, 225 U. 8. 7-1-35, Justice 30111188 Of the
Supreme court, held that a decision of the appellate court should not
be followed but that that of the trial court should have been followed
(on a second appeal), not only because the court had the discretion, if
net the duty, to do so, but because such decision was right.=t certainly
in the instant case justice and rigt entitles the petitioner to have the
liability of the defendant determined according to the provisions of a
treaty entered into by the petitioner and the defendant, and that it

not be penalized by the failure of its lawyers to claim for it the larger

measure of damages to which it was entitled in the first round of the

fight. Ehey did claim this measure of damages before the case was

finally determined, and if pleadings and practice can be construed
irithout violence to any applicable ro.les of law or procedure so as to
do the right and Just thing  construction should be permitted.

AS TO '£’E"'.-:1; AI-IOUHT OF AWARD IE BASED OR’ WHAT TE LAND
EOITLD HAVE SOLD F03. IE‘ SOLD AS PROVIDED BY TREATY

 

The language of the treaty as to selling the land is as follows;

 

"' "‘ “ Said lands shall be surveyed and sold, under the
direction of the secretary of the Interior, on the most
advantageous terms, for cash, as public lands are surveyed

and sold under existing laws, "' * *; but no preemption

claim or homestead settlement shall be recognized; * '3 *.

Qhe petitioner contends that said provisions mean that said lands
shall be sold for money and that by that is meant that no scrip or
warrant of any  shall be received therefor; that the provisions‘ providing for sales to be made under the direction of the Secretary of the
Interior and on the most advantageous terms mean that said lands can be
sold for such percentage of the-total sales price at the time of the
purchase and on such terms as to balance due as my be thought by the
Secretary oi the Interior to be the most advantageous to the Indians.
Ehe writer thinks the construction of the petitioner of said provisions
of said treaty is sound. wherefore, such sales of these lands themselves
and of other lands similarly situated which occurred during such period
as the sale of said lands to settlers would have involved, becomes
proper evidence to be considered.

The evidence introducedby the petitioner which is claimed by it
to show that it would have received the average price of $14.00 per acre

for same, if the selling had been according to the terms of the treaty,

is voluminous and mention of all of it is thought unnecessary for this

u ' with -41- an l.d- 0.4opinion. I think that mention of the evidence of the sales of unimproved

lands within the ceded territory and of sales of other unimproved lands
of comparable character and locations during the period shortly prior to
the date of the treaty and within a few years thereafter is all that is

necessary.

For the reasons stated mention will ‘beyrmade only of the evidence of

the hereinafter described. sales, to-'-wit;

Kansas Lands: when Kansas was admitted as a state it received from

 

congress over 500,000 acres of land known as internal improvement lands.

The state of Kansas allocated. these lands to four different railroads and

appointed. an agent to sell them. The ‘agent began selling the land at the
minimum statutory price of $l._25 per acre  made no effort to obtain
higher prices for same. The railroads complained. that'$l.25 per acre was
less than the market value of the land and ultimately 89 ,690 acres was
acquired by the Kansas and Keosho Valley Railroad; which road sold the
lands to settlers in the years imediately prior to 1872 at an average
price of $2.81} per acre. 89,095 acres as a unit seem to have been sold

to the Land ‘Grant Railway and Trust Gowns? in December 1859 for $11-.3-‘:5
per acre.

other lands  the state of Kansas granted to.it ‘by the United states

located near the Osage ceded. lands were sold by the state during the years
l865 to 1859,” the prices per acre ranging from $3 .140 to $5.66.

osage ceded Area: Under the sales program of Kansas for sale of

 

state school Lands in the osage ceded area beginning wit the year 1869

3- 282

 

 3 283
  the state received an average of $3 .26 per acre, its first sale being
    made in 1870.
   cherokee Lands: in Indian tract known as Cherokee neutral lands
 of 799,611’: acres adjoined the Osage ceded lands on the East. Before
 proceeding to sell said lands they were appraised by ‘two amraisers,
 one chosen by the Indians and one chosen by the United states, and the
 '  unoccupied and uniwoved lands were appraised as of July l866 at
  $l.39"'3/14 per acre, and this unimproved tract of 940,199 .69 acres was
  sold as a unit at $1.00 per acre and ‘was later sold to settlers in
at  small tracts, 117,752.06 in 1869 at an average price of $11-.110 per acre
  and 165,260.79 acres in 1870 at an average of $7.18 per acre. ' The
E’;  _evidence indicates that the Osage lands were more valuable because of
 their fertility, etc., than nrere the Cherokee lands.
 The land involved herein with the exception of ‘a small area of
 ” timbered land along the river bottom is suited for agriculture and
--E  stock raising.°. counties within the area are given high rating by the
  Kansas ‘state Board of Agriculture for their agricultural standing the
‘   years from 1d'{2 to 1878.

  It is undisputed. that first the ‘prospects and then the ‘building
   of the railroad through the area involved contributed to the gradually
:2 : increasing value of the lands. The first railroad grant la.w.was the
3 ____ . 0’  a dot of }{a:."ch 3, 1863 (12 Stat. 772), and.ne::t_ the Act of July 26, 1865, .

  (1)-L stat. 289), under which the Leavenworth and the Union Pacific
'-0. 0  Railroads were built through the ceded area. The demand for the lands
 involved continued to increase — and therefore the sales prices that
i  could have been received for the same had sales been carried out over

the period of years as provided for and contemplated ‘by the provisions
of the treaty would have increased. tfhe authorization of the railroads
throughout the area was prior to the date oi‘ the treaty, and one was
completed by June 6, 1870, and the other by September 3, 1871. The
actual selling of the land could_ not have ‘begun until l868 ‘because the
treaty was not ratified until June 26, 1866, and not proclaimed until
Jamzary 21, 1867,  the surveying of the land was not completed until
the end of 1867. The first official directive for their sale was the
order of the President of June 20%, 1868, directing sale at public auction.
Full statement as to the authorization of the building of these
railroads, their construction and completion,‘ is set out in the opinion
of my colleagues, and I .am confident same is correct and therefore will
not make any further statement as to same. However, I differpwith my
colleagues as to the matter of taking the railroad p‘icto.re into consideration in determining the value of said lands as a unit, or in determining uhatthey would have sold for if they had been sold under the
terms of the treaty. In this connection it will be noted that the court
of claims inits opinion in this case‘ called attention to the fact that
the railroads were in prospect at the time the treaty was signed -- in
fact two years ‘before the treaty was signed -— and that tit is common

knowledge that the prospect of a railroad in thearea mcreases a demand

a for, and the value of, such land; 3 and further that when the railroad

is actually built, those portions through which it runs increase greatly

in value by virtue of the road and the towns that sprmg up along the

lineal

The writer man that the case (:3. s. vs. Miller, 317 U. s. 369)
relied upon by my colleagues as authority for their viewpoint that the
railroad picture in the instant case should not ‘be taken into consideration in determining the value of the lands is authority for a
contrary view. While it may be that the acreage involved herein includes ihe rig;ht—of-way of the railroad (a small part), the great bulk
of same was, of course, lands adjacent and tributary to that to be
occupied. by the railroads. In the Miller case the court said;

The question then is whether the respondents! lands

were probably within the scope of the project from the

time the government was committed to it. If they were

not, but were merely adjacent lands, the subsequent enlargement oi‘ the project to include them. ought not to s

deprive the respondents of the value added in the meantim

by the proximity of the improvement.

Therefore, in the writeris view, even thcughmy colleagues should
be correct in the measure of damages applied, they were wrong in failing
to take into considerationthe railroad situation in determining the
value of the lands; and if that evidence had been taken into consideration it would seem that the lands should have been given a value of from

25 to 50 cents per acre in addition to its value as ‘fixed without taking

such evidence into consideration .

AS TO TEE ACFEAGE INVOLVED
Upon the trial of this case prior to the decision from which appeal
was taken to the court of claims, by stipulation it was agreed 13$’: the
amount of the acreage ceded ‘by the treaty’ involved was 865,930 .31 acres.‘
However, the defendant reserved the right to substitute more accurate

figures. This hearing was on December 15, l9’-J, and the discussion with

Upon the re-trial of the case since remand by the court of claims, the
petitioner by its ®i‘oit 17 introduced evidence of the acreage as being
871,891.11 acres, this being the amount stated to be the acreage by .a
latter of the comptroller General dated April 2.1, 1941. Although the
report of the disposition of the lands in evidence does not show the
-disposition of this fall number of acres, nevertheless, it seems that
this letter is the best evidence in the record of the enct acreage

of the cession, so I willaccept this amount as being correct.

The treaty of September 29, 1865 involved herein, provides in

a article 3 for the donation ofpone section of land to the catholic

Mission and the right of the 1-sission to purchase two additional
sections at $1.25 per acre .' mhe record shows the patent to the Mission
as a donation of 631L.13 acres and the grant to the Mission at $1.25 per
acre of 1263 .55 acres. Article 5 or the treaty provides for a donation
of one section to the heirs of charles Mograin, and the record shows a
patent to these heirs as a gift of 5110.31 acres. Lrticle 111» of the
treaty provides for the gift to the heirs of Joseph Swiss of a one-half
section of land, and the record shows a patent to these heirs as a donation for 320 acres. Article 11!. of the treaty provides for a. donation
to half-breeds of the Osage mribe of Indians not to exceed 25 in mzmber,
of 80 acres each, and the record shows patents as donations of 2052.03

acres. These total donations aggregate 36145.27 acres.

Article 14- of the treaty‘ provides for the sale to the settlers then ‘

residing on the lands of not exceeding one—fonrth section each at $1.25

per acre, and the records show thus was patented. to these settlers
