By stipulation filed by the parties and approved by’ the Commission I

(D

on rt:-2z~ch 13, 3.953, th pareies agreed that the initial°hearing before
the Commission would be limited to the issues presented by defendant's
three legal defenses, i.e., (1) that the Treaty of Fort Laramie being
but a treaty of amity, the petitioner, Crow Tribe, acquired no compensable
estate in the lands therein described, (2) that the issues alleged in the
petition are r_e_s_ adiudicata by virtue of the prior decision rendered by
the Court of Claims in Crow Nation ‘V. United States, 81 C. Cls. 238, and
(3) that the Commission has no jurisdiction by virtue of Section II of
the Act approved July 3 , 1926, 1.1).; Stat. 80?.

A hearing was held limited to a determination of the issues raised
by these legal defenses, evidence introduced, and the issues briefed.

After a study of the record produced and the legal argumnts of the

parties the Commission made findings of i‘ act and rendered an opinion on

(‘.0

the issues raised (3 Ind. Cl. Comm. lb?) and concluded that the prior

decision was not res adjudicate, that the bar of the provisions of

 

Section LL of the 1926 Act did not apply, and that the United States by
the Treaty of Fort Laramie had recognized Indian title in petitioner to
the lands later ceded to the United States by the Treaty of Iiay 7, 1868
(15 Stat. 619). Thereafter, the Commission by Order of October 12, 1955,
ordered a further hearing to determine all issues not previously disposed of, including the question of the consideration paid for the
cession of May 7, 1868, and the value of the land as of said date, but
not including the questions of offsets, if any.

Hearings having been held on the issues so defined in the Order of
October 12, l9SS, the Commission makes the following findings of fact
which are supplemental to the findings numbered 1 to 12, inclusive, heretofore made herein:

13. The territory which the Crow Tribe ceded by the Treaty of May 7,
1868, II Kapp. 1008, 15 Stat. 6149, comprised 30,S30,76h.8 acres, located

in the present states of Montana and Wyoming. The consideration paid for

said cession to the Crow Tribe by the United States amounts to -1-3l,6)_1l.v ,S'8S.}_L9.

(This amount was agreed to by both parties in their briefs.)

114. As of May 7, l868, the area ceded by the Crows had not been
opened to non-Indian settlement and was still in a relatively underdeveloped state. The character of the region was fairly well known since
it had been long used by trappers and traders, explored by prospectors,

and examined by official and unofficial expeditions seeking roads or

trails through the area. The belief that the mineral resources,

gold, of the area might prove of great value resulted in demands that
Indian title to the area be extinguished. The adaptability of parts of
the area to grazing use was at that time recognized as was the suitability
of some of the valley lands, such as those on the Yellowstone and Wind
Rivers, for irrigated agricultural use.

15. (a) Although at the time of the cession in 1868 the area had
not been opened to non-Indian settlement, there were a small number of
miners and a few settlers within the lands, ‘such as at Miner ‘s Delight,
a mining town near South Pass, Wyoming, in a small mining area both
within and just outside of the ceded area and others adjoining the ceded
area in the north at the copper lode at Copperopolis in Montana Territory.
South of the ceded area in Wyoming permanent settlement of any size at all
was just beginning with the advent in 1868 of the Union Pacific Railroad
into Wyoming Territory. Prior to this era the only settlers had been
the operators of the ranch stations who supplied the wagon trains on the
transcontinental routes. Settlement in Ttyoming Territory was confined
to along the route of the Union Pacific as of this period for the most
part and the Federal Census gave the total population as 9118 in the
year 1870, and 20,595 for Montana Territory. The late 1860's also saw
the beginning of the "open rage" operations in Wyoming with the arrival
of the Texas trail herds into the southeastern part of the territory
and this “open range” system where the cattlemen made free use of the
public domain was to continue through the 1880's not only in the southern

part of this territory but later on the lands of the ceded area when there

was an end to Indian trouble.

(b) With the discovery of gold in northern and western Montana in
1862 and 1861; settlement began in the val_'Leys.of the lands adjoining.
the western boundary of Crow Territory. Agiculture and ranch type
stock raising developed in these valleys, such as in Gallatin Valley.

As the mining boom diminished the miners either became settlers, joining

those who had been supplying them, and engaged in farming or stock raising

or they left the area to prospect for gold in other regions such as the

Crow Territory. The cattle industry in western aiontana was expanding

eastward at the time of the cession and these ranch men looked with favor

on the grazing lands in the northern part of the Crow Territory to their

east, as did the mining and other business people who sought improved I
transportation to the mining regions.

16. The westward tide of immigration during the 1860's, the prospecting f or and discovery of gold and other minerals on or near the lands

set apart for the Indian tribes by the Treaty of Fort Laramie, September 17.,

1851, ll Stat. 7&9, and the construction of wagon roads across Indian
country such as the Bozeman and Bridgentrails through Crow Territory

in 18611 and 1865 to the Montana mining communities were among the events
which culminated in the so-called Sioux War of 1866-1867, and 
ties continuing to about 1877, made travel of any kind across 
Territory exceedingly dangerous. As of the date of the cession, T[ndi_an

hostilities would have deterred any large scale settlement of iv’..I;*:::: y:::2:;2de~.:;

area which, although Crow territory, was the hunting ground oi‘ the Sioux

and other tribes over which the buffalo roamed in large herds   r"_'e:r7_.’_'

area was also virtually surrounded by lands held by Indians ‘gr ”

as reservations or as hunting grounds.

17. (a) The territcry ceded by the Crow Tribe’ on May 7, l868, was
varied in topography and resources. The eastern portion of the ceded
area, extending in excess of l0,000,000 acres, consisted of prairie
grasslands. In the Montana portion of the ceded area, these prairies
extended westward to approximately the l09th meridian, where the topographical pattern merges into the foothills of the Crazy Mountains.

The western extent of the prairie lands in Wyoming was marked by the
foothills from the eastern slope of the Big Horn I‘-Iountains. West of

the Big Horn Mountains was the Big Horn Basin, and to the south of this
basin, separated from it by the Owl Creek Mountains, was the Wind River
Basin. The floors of these large, intermountain basins were characterized
by wide expanses of rolling plains, cut by eroded valleys and stream
courses. The western boundary of the ceded area in Wyoming was formed

by the Rocky Mountain front ranges, including the Absarokas, the Shoshones
and the Wind River ranges. The western boundary of the ceded area in
Montana was defined by the Yellowstone River and a line extending northward from the great bend of the Yellowstone to the headwaters of the
Musselshell.

(b) The mountain ranges included within this area were steep and
rugged rising to elevations from 11,000 to 13,000 feet.

(c) The principal water courses arising upon or flowing through the
ceded area were the Tongue and Powder rivers, draining the eastern slopes
of the Big Horn 2‘-*Iounta.ins, the Big Horn River, the largest tributary of 0
the Yellowstone, draining the Wind River and Big Horn Basins, the Clark

N.

Fork of the Yellowstone, arisinr east of Yellowstone National Park, t ..e

Yellowstone River, forming one of the most fertileand productive valleys
in the entire Missouri basin drainage, and the Shields River draining a
small basin in the northwestern portion of the ceded area.

(d) The soils of the eastern prairies, the foothills, and the alluvial flood plains along the main water courses were rich and fertile.
Portions of the soils in the intermountain basins were deficient in
organic fertility.

18. The climate of the ceded area was also diversified. The
prairie lands received typically from lh to 15 inches of precipitation,
about 3/11 of which fell during the growing season. The Big Horn and
Wind River Basins were comparatively arid, with a considerable part of
the basins receiving about 10 inches or less annual. pr-er:-ipi +-a+.-:?.on. The
aridity of these basins li.mited natural forage production but was favorable for irrigated agriculture. some of the mountains received precipitation up to 30 inches per year in the higher elevations, mostly in the
form of snowfall during the winter and early spring, which could supply
irrigation water to the lower basin and prairie lands.

The climate, though characteristically northern and I'igOI‘{‘f:T,"*F?‘-5. was
favorable for most agricultural crops. Temperature ranges were CC=1":a.i5;i..('3.E£31"mable in some locations, but in large sheltered areas in the prair;;_e:i;;; 
intermountain basins temperature ranges were comparable to those for

northern Illinois and northern Iowa.

Wind velocities and evaporation

rates were moderate for western climates. The area was climatically well

suited for stockranchi ng, with as long a grazing season as

the northwest.

19. The -natural forage cover of the ceded area which was estimated, admittedly somewhat arbitrarily, fell into four principal
rangeland types, with miscellaneous additional types of lesser extent

and importance.

(a) The largest natural rangeland type was prairie grassland,
comprising about l0,hO0,000 acres. This type, characterized by a
highly productive combination of short and mid-gasses, provided an
excellent seasonal balance for year around grazing. It was one of the
best grazing areas in the west, having a capacity of 2.5 acres per

animal unit month or 30 acres per cow year long.

(b) The next largest rangeland type was sagebrush grassland,

"'J'.."J."' '.

south and west of the Big Horn Mountains, along the west side of the
Big Horn Basin in Wyoming, and in eastern Montana to the north of the

Yellowstone River. The grasses associated with the sagebrush in this

range type made it also a productive and good rangeland type, having an

average grazing capacity of approximately 3.5 acres per animal unit month.

(c) There were approximately b,lO0,000 acres of desert shrub rangeland within the ceded area, occurring mainly in the Big Horn and Wind

River Basins .

this type, its average grazing capacity was only about 7 acres per animal unit month.
(d) The fourth principal natural range type was made up of foothill grasslands, c mprising approximately 1,680,000 acres in the ceded

area. This type occurred eastward from the escarpment of the Crazy

While shrubs and grasses suitable for grazing occurred in

Mountains, along the east side of the Big Horn Range, and locally along

the west side of the Big Horn Basin. The type was characterized by

highly productive bunch grasses with an average grazing capacity of 2
acres per animal unit month.

(e) The remaining portions of the ceded area, forming several
miscellaneous natural rangelandtypes, were largely in the mountainous

areas now included within national forests. Most of these lands were

characterized by some type of timber growth, with ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, spruce and fir predominating. Most of these areas also had a

usable understory of forage, with grazing capacity varying from 2.5 acres

per animal unit month to 12 acres per animal unit month.

20. By virtue of i..s location,

topography and soils, climate, water
distribution, vegetative cover, and other natural resources, the area
ceded by the Crow Tribe by the Treaty of May 7, 1868, was adaptable to
several economic uses, including irrigated crop farming, livestock

grazing, lumber production, and mineral development.

21. As of May 7, 1868, and within the foreseeable future thereafter,

the principal economic use for the most of the ceded area wo'u,11<:3.  ‘-..:::r:2»

for livestock grazing. The foothill. grasslands, prairie grassZtl_.a.:?';;;::¥.;.v;,.
brush grasslands, and desert shrub rangelands were substantia.'!.l_y 
adaptable to this economic use. In addition, large portions of :2 trr‘:
tain lands now included within national forests were useful for grazing

purposes .

22. The timbercd areas of the lands ceded by the Crows   T i ’

were generally associated with the more mountainous regions,

'*- ..~ 1. -- “.4 -._-§.{_.){,

approximately -34,700 ,883 acres. These are largely the lands presently
included within the national forests and the timbered area of the Shoshone
Indian Reservation. Not all of these forested areas sustain commercial
stands of timber. The timbered areas supported approximatelsr 3,62b,,OO0,000
board feet of timber as of 1868. Lodgepole pine was the predominant type
with Engleman spruce, Douglas fir , and ponderosa pine, occurring in substantial, but lesser quantities.

23. As of May 7, l868, any increment to the value of the ceded
area because of the known or suspected existence of mineral resources,
such as gold, copper and coal deposits, and because of timber upon a

part of the lands would have been speculative and nogainal.

dual sales ‘of 160-acre pre-emption claims during the period 1865 to
1873, in 3 counties of western Montana adjoining the Crow ceded area

to the northwest; 10 early sales involving l6O acres near the ceded
area on the northeast and southeast between 1872 and 1885; and 23 early
sales of 160-acre claims and homestead entries within the Crow ceded
area between 1875 and 1885. The small sales both within and outside of
the ceded area were for the most part select locations in river valleys
and sold for an average of about $2.110 to $2.50 per acre.

25. Railroad Sales - (a) The Northern Pacific and Union Pacific
Railroads were given substantial land grants by the United States in
aid of constructing their transcontinental lines. These land grants
encompassed alternate sections extending for a prescribed distance on

both sides of the railroad's right-of-way. In Montana the Northern

Pacific Railroad received approximately nineteen million acres of land
grants while the Union Pacific received 14,600,000 acres of granted land
in Wyoming. The railroads sold these lands to obtain capital to pay

for the construction of their lines or to pay off indebtedness incurred
during the construction of their lines. The railroads carried on.vigorous sales programs, offering the land on attractive terms.

(b) The Union Pacific Railroad entered Wyoming from the east in
1867, and by 1868, had been completed to Cheyenne, some 1:75 miles southeast of the Crow ceded lands. In 1869 the western and eastern branches
of this transcontinental line were joined at Promontory Point in Utah.

The Northern Pacific was the first railroad actually to enter the

Crow ceded lands. Explorations for this northern transcontinental route P

had begun with Governor Stevens‘ eamedition in 1853. Following his favorable report, the Northern Pacific Railroad was chartered and received

its land grant in l86h. The route ultimately followed through the Crow

territory along the Yellowstone was under active consideration prior to

May 7, 1868. As of 1868, expectations in Montana were optimistic, and

the extension of the Northern Pacific into Montana had been promised to

precede the Union Pacific into Utah. In fact, the constructiozn   P"

railroad was terminated at Bismarck, North Dakota in 1873, W§'1.si'..'.-.'i.=;"".

grass was greatly delayed by the financial panic of 1873. As a :*r=-s=.~s.:3.i! 
the Northern Pacific did not reach the eastern Montana border  

summer of 1881. The rails had crossed the Crow area by December 1882,

and on September 8, 1883 the eastern section of the railroad   

western section in western I-fontana to form the transcontinental '<'.:'-‘.;.':._.'r';'=_.f,.'-‘’a_. ;  

5 107,(C) From 1882, when the Northern Pacific Railway began selling
lands in Montana, until 1899, the railroad made some 2,888 sales in the
state of Montana involving a total of l,992,6?5.l3 acres, for a total
consideration of $h,222,l3h.b,2, or approximately $32.12 per acre. Substantial portions of this total were within the Crow ceded area. Other
substantial portions would have been near or adjoining the ceded area
to the east and the west. Since these were the earliest sales of the
Northern Pacific's land grants in Montana, they probably were made up
of the choicest selections.

26. The Union Pacific Railroad, according to one source, in 1881;
Sold 555, 890 acres of its land grant in Albany and Carbon Counties,
Wyoming. to the Swan Land and Cattle Company for a reported price of‘
$160,990, or an average of $.83 per acre. Other sources place the
acreage at 5h9,h23 acres. The contracts of sale are not in evidence
but two of them appear in the record in Docket No. 63. One contract
(Dkb. 63 - Def. Ex. lhS) entered into by the Swan Company and the railroad on September 29, 1881;, called for the sale of 286,h73.08 acres of
land in Carbon County for the sum of $1h3,236.Sh, or at the rate of $.50
per acre. ‘I'his sales contract called for payment in ten instalments with
interest. The contract was cancelled on July 29, 1899, (Dkt. 63 - Def.
Ex. 11:6). A second contract entered into on September 29, 1881;, between
the Swan Cattle Company and the Union Pacific (Dirt. 63 .. Def. Ex. lhh)
called for the sale of l79,305.h8 acres of land in Albany County, for a
consideration of 3-89,6S2.7h, or at the rate of $.50 per acre, payable
with interest in ten annual instalments. These two sales totaled h6S,?78.S6

acres of land sold to the 5 *an Company by the Union Pacific.

27. (a) The Northern Pacific sales included seven separate transactions made with Mr. David Auchard between 1891 and 189? involving an
aggregate of 56,356 acres for a total purchase price of $65,256.00, or
an average of $1.16 mr acre. Only one of these sales involved a large
tract of land, be@ the sale of h8,7l3.2l acres for $51,500.00 or an
average of about $1.05 per acre. The sales were in the foothill grasslands of western I-Iontana, some 15 miles north of Helena. According to
petitioner‘s appraiser, Mr. Saunderson, the lands were comparable to,

though notias valuable as, the foothill grasslands of the area ceded by

"the Crow Tribe in 1868.

(b) Another large sale by the Northern Pacific in western Montana

price of $316,975.02, or about $32.10 per acre. The agreement was negotiated in the 1890's and consummated in 1901. These lands were located
approximately l75 rniles west of the western border of the Crow ceded lands
in the Missoula and Flathead River drainages, ‘and near the line of the
railroad. The timber areas, according to petitioner’s appraiser, were
substantially better than the timbered portions of the Crow ceded arm
but the range resources were not as good as the rangelands in the Crow
timbered areas.

28. (a) Seven sales were made by the Northern Pacific Railroad to "t:.h;===
Musselshell Cattle Company from 1886 to 1898. These sales covered a total
of 23,021; acres for an aggregate consideration of $33,269.11, or an average
of $1.345 per acre. These lands were located within the Crow ceded area,

north of the Yellowstone River. According to petitioner's appraiser these

lands were prairie grasslands slightly better than the average of the
prairie grasslands in the ceded area as a whole.

(b) Ten sales within the same general area were made by the Northern
Pacific to the Montana Cattle Company in 1895, 1895 and 1899, covering 3
total of 58,102 acres for $1.00 per acre. They'were prairie grasslands
lying within the ceded area, but slightly better than the average of the

prairie grasslands of the ceded.area taken as a whole according to petitioner*s appraiser.

(c) There were several smaller sales by the Northern Pacific of foothill grasslands actually within the area ceded by the Crow Tribe. Three

of these were made to the Smith Brothers Sheep Company in 1897, involving

own‘

an aggregate O1 lu,992 'cres for a total consideration of $15,261.00, or

about $1.22 per acre. These lands were located south,of the Musselshell

River near the present town of Martinsdale. One additional sale involved

8 9,277.68 acres of foothill grasslands within the Crow ceded area.which

was made to Widdecomb in 1899, for the sum of $11,597.10, or about $1.25
per acre. ‘All of these, according to petitioner‘s appraiser, were foothill grasslands within the ceded area, and typical of the foothill grasslands of the ceded area as a whole.

29. ~The Crow ceded area consisting of 30,S30,76h.8 acres had a
fair market value of $l2,2l2,305.00 as of May 7, 1868, or at the rate of
no cents per acre. The consideration of $l,6hh,S8S.h9 paid to the Crow

Tribe under the provisions of the Treaty of May 7, l868, for the cession

of lands having a value of $l2,2l2,3OS.OO was grossly inadequate and

6 111

unconscionable. The Crow Tribe is chargeable with the sum of $l,6)_1h, S85'.h9_,

the consideration received, leaving a balame payable to petitioner of
$10,567,720, from which will be deducted the offsets, if any, to be hereinafter determined in accordance with the Rules of the Commission.
