River, "and thence to the Chattahouchee, and thence ina straight east
nne toward. the Atlantic coast. to -the then western boundary of lands

to which Indian title had been extinguished.

As to the northern, western and southern boundaries, there are differences of opinion, and these differences result in varying proofs of
total acreage. The petitioner, by-requested finding Nos 51$, claims the
acreagejotj’ thewcession to bee total-of 2‘5‘,936'.901 acres -_-- 17,917,391
in Alabama; 1406.110 in Mississippi: and 7,612,300 in Georgia. This__
acreage-it claims to be established by claimantis Exhibits Nos. 1 and
no. The _'_Indian Office finds the acreage to be 21,769,600 (01, Ex. 31).

i ; There are some conflicting claims on the part of the Choctaws.
Chickasaws and Cherokees as to the dividing line between their holdings
and thosetof the Creeks to the north and west; however. it seems pretty
generally agreed that the western line of the Creek territory was neither
the Tombigbee River nor the Alabama River. nor the watershed between
these two rivers. Royce substantially follows the watershed betseen
these two trivers.in fixing the western boundary of Plat 75 (which he
determines the Jackson Erepaty cession to be). The beginning of hostilities between the hostile Greeks and the loyal Creeks was in southwestern Alabama along the eastern banks of the Tombigbee River, which
would indicate the C;-teeksi to be in possession then of a large portion
of that appears on B.oyce“s Map to be Plats 61 and 82; however, the area
of 61 had been ceded by the Chickasaws to the United States on Hovember
16, 1805, and the area of Plat 82 was ceded by the Choctaws on November
2%. 1816.

The record indicates, however, that the cessions of the

Choctaws of Plat 82 and of Plat 80 were more in the nature of quitclaims

located at a point on the east bank of the Alabama River about 35 miles
north of Fort Mime, this territory being said by Governor Clay at the
time to be the best of the enemy°s country. (Rowland's.Andrew Jackson.
pp. skis}; 167-182). In this history of these battles Rowland frequentlyfki refers to this territory as being the east boundary of the
Choctaw-and Chickasaw lands. For the protection or this territory some

twenty-odd forts were constructed along the Tombigbee and Alabama Rivers.

(Rowland, pp. 81-1-93).

As to the southern boundary, in a treaty between Governor Oglethorpe
of Georgia and the Greeks, Cherokees and Chickasaws, on August 21, 1739,
it was declared i

"" ‘ " the lands between the Savannah and’ St. John"s Rivers,

' ‘ ’ and from the St. John‘s River to the Apalachie Bay, and‘

thence to the mountains, do, by ancient right belong to the a

Greek Ration. * * ’.“

and Defendant's Exhibit No. 55 as that fixed by the treaty of the Cherokees on March 22, 1816. which is the south line of the Royce Plat Ho. 79.

l Ihere seems no doubt that the Greeks occupied lands even further north.

probably to the Tennessee River. however, no claim is now being made by

the Greeks for the lands north of the south line of plat 79.

The difference in the acreage as shown by Boyce (Plat 75) and that
claimed by the petitioner, based on Claimant's Exhibit No. 1, is approximately 9; 337,000 acres.

The defendant in its brief (p. llh) refers to Dr. Swanton as being

‘beyond any doubt the leading authority, living or dead, on the Creek
Indians,_and.we might add, his integrity is unimpeachable.“ Dr. Stanton

testified_that the Greeks occupied the territory from the Tennessee

Vkiver on the north to Florida.on the south, and to the Tombigbee River

on the west. His answer to inquiry by the defendant as to whether or
not they occupied the described territory (referring to Plat 75 of Boyce)

was ‘Yes, practically all that territory.“ He also testified that they
occupied.Plat Ho. 82 on the west of 75 and that he did not know of any
Choctaw settlements east of the Tombigbee River. yThere was much other

testimony in the record to the effect that the Greeks occupied territory to the Tombigbee.

While defendant, in its original answer, alleges "that at the time
said treaty of August 9} 1813 was made, the lands involved were unsurveyed, the boundaries were indefinite, and the title, if any, of the

dDefendant. in its hrief. says

‘Defendant does not dispute that the Creek Nation had
Indian title to a large area of land in Alabama and Georgia
but the exact location of the area and the acreage therein is a
matter to be determined in the event that the Commission adiudges

the defendant liable for the value of the lands ceded under the
C treaty of 181k. a _ F

"The acreage of the cession and the pwnerahip of the
lands can be determined with a.high accuracy. ‘ ‘ ‘.3

Dr. Swanton. the defendant‘s witness, gave the following testimony"

in response to the following question:

,~ “Q, Doctor, I will ask you.if the lands that were ceded

under the Treaty of 181% belonged to the Creek Nation, the Upper
:Creeks or the Lower Creeks?

I

‘A. The Creek Nation. tof course, the lands. you understand,
nearer the two divisions were considered to be of more particular

interest to the division concerned, but the lands were recognized
as Creek lands.“

Supplementing the historical information as to the use and occupancy
of the territory as hereinabove outlined, from the activities during the
Creek hostilities in 1812, and the years following, it seems certain that
at that time the Greeks were very numerous in southwestern Alabama to

the Florida line -= in feet, south of the Florida line almost to Pensar

cola.

_ Jackson's activities in this war began in October 1813. and his
first act was the building of Fort Deposit which is on the Tennessee
River. _This would indicate that that‘ was the north frontier of the
Greek occupancy;

Accompanying the “EARL! HISTORY OF THE CREEK IKDIANS ANQ THEIR
EEIGE3gBS”_by John R. Swanton; being Bulletin 73_of the Bureau of
American Ethnology. are a number of maps compiled by him. among them
being:Plat 2, denominated "Territory of the States of Georgia and
Alabama.“ illustrating the geographical distribution and movements of
the tribes and towns of the Creek confederacy. It is somewhat difficult
to determine the dates of the settlements depicted -— however, settlements of Greek and other tribes and towns of the Creek confederacy_are
shown at some time to have been as far north as the Tennessee River,
as far west as the_Tombigbee River, also practically to the mouth of
the Tombigbee and the Alabama. and extending along the Alabama to its
source 4; very numerous in the territory drained by the Coosa and
Tallapoosa. and especially the territory beteeen these two rivers and
at the point of their junction. Rowland claims that the Alibamos

(a Greek tribe) occupied and.c1aimed the land lying along the east

bank of the Tombigbes.Riyer.

The next question arising is whether or hot the treaty of.August 9.
1813 was a treaty of capitulation as the result of war between the
United States and the Creek Ration and the lands acquired by the United
States by reason thereof. and became an acquisition as a result of cone

quest or indemnification for war costs.

warriors. The evidence as to whether or not a majority of the members

_ Under all the authorities. therefore, it’seems that it cannot be

United States were at war with eadiother, the defendant cites the case
at Marks, et al. v. The United States, as c. ole. ihi, affirmed hy 161
‘U. S. 297, which holds that no formal declaration of war is necessary
to constitute an Indian war with the United States: that it is sufficient that hostilities exist between the two and military operations
are carried on. While the facts inrolved in the case cited do not
shoe"that the authorities of the lndian tribes (the Bannock and.Piute
tribes) had actually declared.war against the United States or against
the whites, the opinion says that all reports “establish the condition
of actual war so far as that condition can exist between a snall tribe

in obtainingh this treaty. _It is undisputed that General Jackson told

the assembled chiefs and council members that they could sign the treaty

as prepared by him (which ceded between 2o,ooo,ooo and 25,ooo.ooo acres

of lands to the defendant) or they could start marching toward the Semi?
t noles and the British in Florida. and he would follow and drive them

into the Atlantic dcean. to say that “a certain degree of compulsion

"7ftif?é was used.‘ (as defendant does in its brief) is stating the case rather

,vIfeci mildly. Without any doubt the execution of the treaty involved was

secured at the point of the hayonet.

”‘y 5 Revision g§_Trea§y Because 2£_Duress

There may be some doubt as to vhether the treaty is a complete
nullity because the United States see not entitled to indemnity as a
result of war. or whether it should he considered as revised hecause of
duress. At the time of the execution of this treaty the friendly chiefs
of the Creek Nation executed the same under protest. and at the same time
executed shat they denominated as their part of the treaty 9- a statement which was to accompany the treaty uhen foruarded to the Government
hy General Jackson. This statement appears as Finding of Fact Ho. 23.‘
ln this statement there is a practical admission of the iustice and right
of General Jackson to take territory previously occupied by the hostile
Creeks. but‘protested.the taking of lands claimed to be occupied by the
friendly Creeks. It would seem, therefore, that the treaty, if considered
as revised to the extent of eliminating therefrom the cession of lands

claimed as occupied exclusively by the friendly Greeks, it would have

occupiedby the hostiles, and the sigzers oi‘ -the treaty seemed to be
willing to its cession as a proper penalty for §he.nation_ to pay for
the wrongful acts of the hostile Cg-eeks. In this connection it may be

noted that General Jackson did notjaretend at the time that he was ‘taking this land in southeastern .-Alabama and Georgia that it was 'f~conquered_

territory.‘ _In_his letterto the Secretary of War. dated August 10,
18115:. ’accompanying the treaty, referring to the southeastern Alabama
and Georgia lands. he said: “Considerations interesting to the United
States, -relative to the ‘Spanish dominions immediately south of us,
induced me to procure the cession of all the Creek lands of consequence,
bounding on foreign claims of territory, in order to prevent future
Connexions injurious to ‘our tranquillity." L

While there is no evidence in the record as to the value of any of
the lands involved in the cession, and practically none as to the exPense of the United States by reason of the Creek war. it would seem
Probable that the lands ceded (approximately 15 to 19 million acres) in

excess of the 8,81$9,91+O -acres in Georgia and southeastern Alabama would

be considered as a.proper indemnification for the cost of the war.“if
the defendant is entitled to any indemnification. .And uhether legally
entitled to indemnification or not. the friendly chiefs of the_Creek
Hation seemingly were agreeable to the ceding of the lands occupied by
the hostiles, on account of the cost of this war to the United States.

by reason of the fact that the participation of the United States there'in was protection of the loyal friendly Creeks who, but for the help

of the defendant, would probably have been exterminated by the hostile
members of the tribe.

The determination of the liability_of the defendant'by reason of
the inyolved questions of fact and law coming on at this late date
presents to this Commission-a situation somewhat comparable to that
presented to the courts in the case_of Choctaw Nation vs. United States,
119 U. S. l. _The Supreme Court in that case affirmed the award made by
the United States Senate to whomgthe controversies had been referred by
agreement of the parties. The Jurisdictional act under which that litigation was had gave to the courts Jurisdiction to “try all questions of
difference arising 2Et_g£_trea§y stipulations with the Choctae Nation
' ‘ ‘.‘ (Underscoring supplied).

In the Supreme Court’s opinion it is stated:

‘The questions of difference between the United States and

the petitioner, it was alleged, resulted from the nonperformance
and.nonfulfillment by the Uhited States of the obligations
assumed by it under various treaties ’ ' ‘.'

The claims were very involved, covering many transactions and
over many years of dealings. The opinion discusses at considerable

length the relationship of the parties, stating that the Choctar Nation

“stands in a peculiar relation to the United States. It was
capable under the terms of the Constitution of entering into

In the instant case it appears to the Commission that in view of
all the facts and circumstances hereinbefore set forth surrounding the
obtaining of the cession under the Jackson Treaty, the plaintiff should
be granted some fair measure of relief, and we are of the opinion that
on the broad principles of equity and justice plaintiff is entitled to
an award for the amount of $lo769,9MC9 as asserted by it in 1856, which

we believe affords a fair and reasonable measure of compensation to the

plaintiff.

The Release of l8§6

The defendant urges that the general release contained in the
treaty of 1856 is a discharge of the defendant‘s liability on this claim.
Petitioner admits that this defense would be good if the claim were being
urged as a legal liability of the defendant, but being urged under
clauses 3 and 5 of the Indian Claims Commission Actg the release is not
a bar; that the consideration given for the release was unconscionable
and therefore same is not a discharge of the claim.

The negotiations between petitioner and the defendant resulting in
the execution of this release, show that the petitioner was asserting
against the defendant 9 claims aggregating a total of approximately

$3J(oo,,ooo, Claim 1 being for esehgssuo acres of land ceded in the 1811;

founded.“ _~ ; ' s
A_The treaty which contains the release involved also provides for
the cession of 3903T,¥lh,62 acres of Greek lands in the present State of
Oklahoma. Ihe total consideration received by the Creeks for the cession
of this land and the release of all claims was $1,000,000. ‘The informaé
tion provided in the record as to the value of this land is convincing
that the land at the time of its cession was of greater value than the
$1t0005000 paid, and that therefore there was really no consideration
received by the Creeks for the release of the Jackson treaty land claim.
The defendant in its brief says:
‘The evidence definite1y'estab1ishes that the original
offer (of $?009000) was increased.$300,000 (i.e. to $1,000,000)
solely and only for the purpose of making a final adjustment, '

settlement and compromise of the claim now asserted by the
petitioner.” 0

If this be conceded and the land involved recognized as ‘being worth the
20 cents per acre than asserted, the result would be the settlement of
the claim of $1,769,930 for $300,000, which“ under the previous holdings
of the courts and of this Commissiong would be.nnconscionable.e I

The Release 3: 1882

In the negotiations resulting in this release. the Fort Jackson

treaty lands were not discussed, and it is not thought that this release

could.be seriously urged as a bar to the claim.

In the negotiations preliminary to the treaty of 1856 the petitioner asserted a claim in the amount of $l.769,9h0 for the 8,8h9,9HO
acres of land, for which this Commission has decided that petitioner is
entitled to an award, and that value was approved by the then Commissioner

of Indian Affairs and.by the Secretary of the Interior.

8- mum:

 

_8herefore, this Commission finds that the petitioner is entitled

to an award in the sum_of $l.759,9hO. less such offsets, if any. as ’

may-hereafter be allowed in accordance with Sec. 12 of the General

Rules’of Procedure of this Commission.
