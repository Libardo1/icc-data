OPINION OF THE COMMISSION

I Witt, Chief Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.

The petition in this case is for the value of 491,520 acres of
land (less 3,491 acres) alleged as having been owned under Indian title

by the claimant group (that is, by their ancestors) of which ownership

and occupation thereof the claimant was dispossessed by the defendant in

1855, without making any payment to or treaty with this tribe of Indians

with reference thereto. Claimant alleges that defendant is liable to it

do not confer such jurisdiction (Mille Lac Indian case, supra),
and the issue is a political and not a judicial one.

 

In specifically discussing the Muckleshoot claim and the Court‘s

dismissal thereof; the Court said:
Difficult as it has been to trace the genealogy of the
Muckleshoot, it is from the record quite clear that at no time
has the Government recognized its claimed right of occupancy
to the vast acreage claimed. I
The Court decided with reference to the Muckleshoot claim, as it did

of all the claims of the non-treaty Indians, that same was based upon the

original rights of those Indians, and since they had never been recognized

-by the defendant the Court under the jurisdictional aét had no power to

make an award therefor.

As stated in our opinion in the Nooksack case it is obvious that
the Court of Claims did not dismiss the Muckleshoot claim on its merits
but because it had no jurisdiction under the jurisdictional act to
entertain a claim for the validity of land based upon original Indian
title.

In keeping with our opinion in the Nooksack case and the cases

there cited it follows that the defense of res judicata must be denied.

Capacity of Claimant to Sue

 

In keeping with the Findings of Fact it is evident that the claimant

group are the descendants of a group that was formed in l856 by the joinder
or amalgamation of tribes that were probably previously known as the

Skopamish Indians and their subordinate bands and the Smulkamish Indians

as-u-Q

C-—-&

their subordinate bands, and such amalgamated group became kn wn from

o
Jutnat time as the Muckieshoots, and from and after that date said Indians

w ;_;;;-—; ;_-_'_‘._j'_ the jurisdictional act of 1925 was passed by Congress which authorized
 a suit by the Muckleshoot Tribe, and the Court of Claims in its Findings
  of Fact and opinion ttéated such group as a tribe.

  Even though said group in a. strict sense might not be called a

7 ’ :‘;'-:2 tribe, undoubtedly it is an "identifiable" group of American Indians,

  and under the recent decision of the Court of Claims in its Appeals
3   Docket No. l4 in the case of C. W. McGhee, et al., vs. The Creek Nation
UN  A  and the United States, and in the case of Clude F. Thompson, et al. vs.
 United States, Appeals Docket No. 9, both decided in the Court of Claims
' -ion May 6, 1.952, and reported in Vol. 122 of its ‘opinions, it possesses
 capacity to present a claim before this Commission."
 _‘ In keeping with the above, it is the opinion of this Commission
‘  that the claim set .forth in the petition herein is not barred by the

  judgment of the Court of Claims by the decision in Case No. F-275,

 ..    and the claimant has, under the provisions of the Indian Claims Commis _.  _:§ sion Act, the capacity to maintain its action herein.
