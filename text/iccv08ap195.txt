The petitioners in this docket seek to recover the difference between
the sum of $28,lL:S.oo, which. is the amount the United s-hates paid them in
l93l pursuant to an award made by the Pueblo Lands Board for loss of a tract
of land known as the Pecos Pueblo Grant, and the fair market value of the
lands and water rights lost to them, plus interest, or loss of use, less the
‘value of offsets, if any. The grounds for said claim are that the hearings
of'the Pueblo Lands Board were not in compliance with the Act of Congress
which created said Board, that the conduct 0; the Government and of the Pueblo
Lands Board in the hearings and the award to the Pecos Pueblo constituted unfair
and unreasonable dealings, and that the award of $28,lhS.OO or $1.50 per acre
was inadequate, unreasonable, unfair or less than their value.

The Pecos Pueblo Grant is a tract of land consisting of 18,763.33 acres,

as sheen on the survey plat attached to the Patent (Def. EX. 1) which the

United States issued to the Pueblo of Pecos November 1, l86h. It is located
a short distance southeast of the city of Santa Fe in the present counties of
Santa Fe and San Miguel, state of New Mexico.

Finding h.

By Act of June 7, l92h (h3 Stat. 636) Congress provided for the
creation of the Pueblo Lands Board in an effort to provide for the final
adjudication and settlement of a very complicated and difficult series of
conflicting titles affecting lands claimed by the Pueblo Indians of New
Mexico. It was composed of three members, one representing the Secretary of
the Interior, another the Attorney General, and a third appointed by the

resident of the United States.

The Pueblo Lands Board investigated the claim of the Pecos Pueblo

Findin

UT}

tc lands of the Pecos Pueblo Grant which had been patented to them in l86h.
Hearings were held and the United States furnished legal counsel for the

Pueblo. The findings and determination of the Board, which are material

here, are contained in Report No. l (Def. EX. 3) and Report No. 2 (Def. Ex. h).
Both reports are dated at Santa Fe, New Mexico, August h, 1930, and are
signed by Louis H. Warner, Chairman; H. J. Hagerman, For the Secretary of the
Interior, and Charles H. Jennings, For the Attorney General.
Finding 6.

Report No. l, entitled "Report of title to Lands Granted or confirmed to

Pueblo Indians", states in part as follows:

The Pueblo Lands Board, constituted under Act of Congress
approved June 7, 192b, (h3 Stat. L. 636) hereby reports under
Section 2 of said Act as follows:

— Said Board having investigated the lands within the
exterior boundaries of the land lying in the counties
of San Miguel and Santa Fe, State of New iexico, confirmed
to the Pueblo of Pecos, as shown on photostat map hereto
attached and marked “Exhibit AV, being a Spanish Grant asi
confirmed by the Act of Congress approved.December 22, 1858,
and patented November 1, 186b, has determined and hereby
extinguished in.accordance with.the provisions of said Act L
0f June 7,i192h, as to the lands set forth by metes and bounds
as f0ll0WS:. . . . . Total area l8,8lh.SS9 acres.

The foregoing grant is more particularly described by field
notes on file in the office of the Cadastral Engineer, Sante
Fe, New Mexico.

According to the best obtainable hist.rical information,
the Pueblo of Pecos had been greatl; reduced by constant attacks
by hostile Indians. It suffered several severe epidemics and
was from l82§ subjected to every form of coercion and compulsion
on the part of the local Mexican authorities, according to the

appointed by some assembly, which finds in favor of the

restoration of certain lands to the natives of the Pueblo, saying:

"Its oxcslloncy at that tine, 1323. hv this violcnt

plundering without doubt did not rcnumhor tho laws
iwhich treat of respecting the proporty of all individuals."

And it fnrthor found:

"First, that all their lands be rcstorcd to the
natives of the Pueblo of Pecos of rhich they wore
plundered.

Second, that tho citizens possessed thorcof be
notified by the alcoldo of that district of the

%»= ‘no right‘ which they have acquirzd in said possession,

as the grant was given in lands which have owners."

This report was signed by Pino Doc: Arse and rubricatod.

; Apparently in desperation because or the continued harrassing,
the seventeen remaining members of tho pueblo acconronicd thoir
ykinsmen to Jones. There they and thcir dosccndonts have since lived.

L In 1855 an examination of the title to the Pococ Pueblo
_was made by the Surveyor General, who syprovcd it and recommended
iceonfirmation of the grant. This action Congress took by Act of
ighecsmber 22, 1555. In ltoh a potent was issued to the same.

   

is , In the files of the Indian Office thcrc is at least one
is§§cific record of a request by Pecos Puohlc to he restored to
their lands, or that they bo sold or lcnseé for their account and
*;§Ttional lands purchased for them in the demo: roction. This
‘ynsgin 1859. It would appear, therefore; that there was never
_5_ intentional abandonment of their rights by the few surviving
;¢§$ Indians. The records also sh w Eaton and similar requests,

informed that the church records show that there are about 250
claiming sue“ ancestry and that they are recognised as a separate
entity and are accorded an officer in the annual election. If
upon such investigation such lands cannot be segregated for the
specific use of the Feces descendants that they shall be added to
the Jones Pueblo generally, with the understanding that the Pecos
descendants may'prOfit thereby.

The lands lying within the exterior boundaries of said grant
have been surveyed, and the several individual claims are shown
T on photostat plates hereto attached and marked “Exhibit B".

The claims numbered 1 to 339, are called “exceptions” in
the report as this is the usual designation given to extinguished
claims, and are more particularly described as follows: . . . . .

Finding 7.
Report No. 2, entitled "Report Concerning Indian Titles Extinguished",
made under Section 6 of said Act, includes the following:

The area comprised within the outside boundaries of said
Pecos Pueblo Grant as confirmed by this Board is 18,8lh.§§9
acres. The grant was confirmed by Act of Congress December
22; 1358, and patented on November 1, lC6h.

The total number of adverse claims within the exterior
boundaries granted or confirmed to the Pueblo of Pecos and
in the possession.of non-Indian claimants at the time of
the filing of this report was 339.

The total area of said adverse claims was l8,8lh.§S9
acres.

The Board, for sufficient reasons hereinafter referred
to, has determined and hereby determines that title to
.al1.of the lands within the exterior boundaries of the
Pecos Indian.Grant is extinguished.

It does not appear that there are any water rights

lost to the Indians to which specific mention should be
made.

The present ownership of the various tracts within the
exterior boundaries of this Grant was determined by a
$§rVey and study of this area by she Cadastral Engineer by
tdirection of the terior Department and by an independent
lnvestigation conducted by this Board in which the whole
area was checked out. This situation is an ananolcus one

To determine a fair basis for such an avard, in View
of all ins circnor%~:e~s, was difficult. The Board res come
to a conclusion w.icn in its opinion is fair to all concerned.

There is no way to get at the actual valve of th's land
in its entirety as it was at the time shat the Government
might have actof or at the time when the members of the ?ueblo

we have therefore, reached the conclusion, everything

considered,.that $1.30 per acre, which includes, of course,
some land that is not suitable for cultivation or grazing,
would be a fair basis for an award, and that the amount of loss
suffered by the Indians through failure of the United States

to seasonably prosecute any right of the United tates or of
paid Indians is $2€,11.&.:.995.

This is followed by reference to certain transactions and conveyances
involving lands of the Pecos Pueblo Grant. "In 1868 eleven of the
survivors of the Pecos sold their interest in the grant to one John Ward,
whoTha&.been Indian Agent and was on very'friendLy terms with the people, the
idea being;that he would resell thrce—fourths of it, if possible, for the benefit
of the People of the Pueblo." In.l8T3 the Pecos Indians conveyed to frank
Chapnmn_what interest they then had in the grant of 18,763.35 acres for a
.ons:ideration of $5,000.00. The same year Ward conveyed to Chapman for a
consideration of $5,000.00. thcr conveyances down to the year l9l8 were
for varying interests and for named considerations ranging from one dollar
t0‘$19u038.63. During this period, "from the dates of the original deeds
from the Indians in l858 and 1873 down through to 1918, the various claimants
of title had actually exercised control over the tract."

Arnoang these transactions, the Board notes an unsuccessful attempt made
in 13°‘ by some of the settlers to incorporate. It then states:

Here for the first time, as far as can.be ascertained

.from the records, a statement was made that in the years l8hl—
l842 a proceeding was brought before the then Governor of
Mexico looking to the abandonment of this Pueblo. It does not‘
aPP9-ax?‘ that his approval, if he gave it, was in accordance

with the existing laws of Mexico at the time. Otherwise it
would hardly seem reasonable that Congress should have confirmed the grant in the Fneblo on the recommendation of the
then SUTVOYOF general or that it nould.have subsequently issued
authofixation of patent to the Pueblo.

After the summary of these transactions, Report No. 2 concludes as follows:

o.hcr line of title developed
in the settlers who occuiiod the congested areas within this
grant, so that then the t a came for the sale to he carried
through for the amount of land indicated in the agreement of
1912, it was necessary for the owners of the entire tract
who based their claims on Indians deeds, to bring suit to
Quiet title against those who lained through the Eexican
8333i Of 1895. This suit ondo. in the settlers generally

grant to the holders under th

r
long line of transfers referred to, reserving to themselves however, the particular
tracts which they then claimed and occupied.
This interchange of deeds brouglt the situation down

to the present day. t does not seem by any conjecture

that it would be possible for the government to non recover any
of these lands for the Indians. t is not even likely that
such of the Pecos descendants as are now living would want to
occupy the lands if they could be recovered. It therefore
seemed that the only fair and equ'table adjustment of the
entire matter was that the entire tract with its hundreds of
holdings should be surveyed by the Cadastral Engineer on
aughorisation of the Interior Department. This action was
taken and the lands have been extinguished in the individuals
claiming rights within those areas. '

It is probable also that, had the government seasonably prosecuted the Indians’ interests when it came into
control that something might have been recovered for them.
The Indians at that time thought that their rights had not been
.exhausted and, as the records will show, the Indian authorities
were approached with a View to having this land either sold
for their account, leased, or recovered for them. It does
not appear that any action was taken over a period of ten
years from the time that this request was made. The Indians
than 300k What was probably their only recourse under
existinv conditions and sold the land themselves. It does
not appear, from the amount of money recieved in the transactions in which they were parties, that an adequate sum
has been.received by them for this large acreage. The Board

_belicved that it is fair to all concerned to follow the
course indicated. a '
