the General Accounting Office Report of July I7, 1056, submitted as
Defendant‘s Exhibit No. 55, as amended by Defendant's Exilibit N0: 58,
pages 1 and 2.

(a) The $19.00 and $811.00 items listed under agricultural aid
were paid in 19113 and 19ml (all references to yearly disbursements refer
to the fiscal year) under an appropriation entitled "Support and Rehabilitation of Needy Indians.“ (G.A.0. Report. p. 83- In 191:3 and 19th
there were 2,000 Seminole Indians (G.A.0. Report, p. 15): The Source
of these funds indicates their use for individual, needy Indians and
the sums sought to be charged as tribal gratuities are too small to be
considered a distribution for the benefit of a 2,000 member tribe.

They are denied as offsets.

(b) Of the $39,125.35 listed as cash payments to indigent Indians
$2,273.00 paid in 1951 was disbursed under the appropriation. entitled,
“Health, Education, and irfelfare Services, Bureau of Indian Affairs“

duringthe years from l9l.:7 through 1951 from the "Supp01“"t and Rehabilitation of Needy Indians” (G..€..0. Report, pp. 12, 13). The payments are
all listed in the G.A..0. report as being made to indigent Indians. The

defendant's witness, Mr. Francis J. Gillies, a su.pe1*vi5t>I*::f 8Xa1T1i1'19:" for

I Ieminole Indians.

the General Accounting Office, who prepared the G.A.0. report in this

case, testified that the vouchers for all of the relief payments shoe

names of individual Indians and a case number opposite each name (Tr. 305).

The $9,125.35 cash payments to indigent Indians were for the use and
benefit of individual Indians and not a tribal benefit. They are denied
as offsets.

(C) In 1957, a $70.00 item for fuel was expended from the "Welfare
of Indians” appropriation. This amount is listed in the G.A.0. report
as a payment to indigent Indians (o.e.o. Report, p. 12) and.Mr. Gillies
testified at the hearing that this paymnt was made to indigent Indians.
It is denied as an offset.

P- 3) and.the "Support of Indians and Administration of Indian Property"
appropriation ($85.00) (G.A.0. Report, p. 11). These payments constituted a tribal benefit and are proper offsets.

appropriation

pended as subsistence for the support and rehabilitation of needy
Ldians, comprising Seminole and Creek Indians, $63.51;: 511309 the

nditure for the Seminole Nation. Since this Paylnent was made *0 in‘

19. The defendant claims that between July 1, 1930, and June 30,
us, there was disbursed gratuitously for the Seminole Nation, jointly
th other Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes Agency, $50,317-8%
nce the Seminole Indians comprised approximately 2.hf-5 of all Indians

The disbursement of the above items is detailed in Part II, Section C

of the G.A.0. Report, as amended by Defendant's Exhibit 58, pages 3 and h.
(a) The sum of $l2,23h.88 spent for seeds, fruit trees and fertilizer was disbursed dnring the period from l9h2 to l9hS from the "Suppdrt

and Rehabilitation of Needy Indians” appropriation. The source of these

funds indicates their use for individual Indians and not as a tribal

gratuity. There is no evidence indicating distribution of any portion

of these funds to the Seminole Nation. The percentage sought to be offset against the award.to the Seminole Nation is not allowed.

(b) The $115.53 item was spent in l93S for branding irons from
the appropriation entitled "Support Of Indians and AdmiEiSiTati0n Of
Indian Property." The percentage o£’this item sought to be charged
as a Seminole Nation gratuity is $2.77 (2.h% of $115-53)« in View Of
the small amount involved and in the absence of any further proof concerning distribution of branding irons for use by the entire Seminole
Nation, which numbered 1,789 in 1935, this item is disallowed as an
offset.

(c) The $33,72§.h8 expenditure for indigent Indians is broken
down by items as shown above. These payments were made during the years
1931, 1932, 1933, 193b, 1935, 1937, 1938, l9hO, and l9h2. Most of the
money came from the “Support of Indians and administration of ndian
Property“ appropriation (G.A.O. Report, pp. 30~33) although $2,lh3.95
‘was expended from the “Support and Rehabilitation of Needy Indians”
appropriation (G.A.O. Report, p. 22). As the disbursement schedules
in the G.A.0. Report show} these expenditures were for indigent Indians.
These were net‘tribal benefits, and the payments are denied as offsets.

(d) The $h,0S0.00 paid for feed and care of livestock is listed
on page 28 of the G.A.0,.Report as an.expenditnre made in l9h6 for
300 tons of hay. It was paid.irom the appropriation entitled, "Support
and Rehabilitation of Needy Indians," indicating its use for needy
Indians and not as a tribal gratuity. This item is denied as an Off$Qtm

(9) The defendant claims as tribal gratuities the sum of $9l.9&
expended for the transportation of clothing in 1939 and l9hO. The
payments were made from the "Purchase and Transportation of Indian

Supplies“ appropriation. Since all items listed under “clothing” ?T.

.3en disallowed as offsets, the amounts claimed for transportation of
clothing must also be disallowed as cffsetse

20. The defendant claims that during the period from August 1,
1920, to August 31, 19h7: the United tates gratuitously expended the
sum of $3,037.70 for the benefit of the Indians of the Union or Five
Civilized Tribes Agency and that, since the Seminole Nation of Indians
comprised 2.h% of the Indians residing under that agency during that
period, their proportionate share--$73.lh--should be offset against
the award in this case. The payments, which are detailed in Part II,

Section D, of the G.A.O. Report (pages 3h-53), were:

Transportation of:
Agricultural implements

and equipment $ 5.h7
Clothing 3,h37.72
Fuel ' 2.82
Harch-rare, glass, oils,

and  3027

Household equipment

and supplies lO8.h0
Provisions h37.h7
Surveying supplies 2.55

5 3,oh?.?o

The sums expended for items under the headings of “agricultural implements and equipment,“ “clothing," “:E‘uel," and "household equipment and
supplies" have been disallowed as offsets.
charges under those headings are disallowed as offsets. The $h37.h7
listed as transportation charges for provisions cannot be included as

a proper offset since all items relating to subsistence have been disallowed as offsets.

transportation of "hardw re, glass, oils and paints" and $2.55 for

Accordingly, the transportation.

The defendantealso lists offset items of $3.27 for

transportation pf “supplies for surveying Indian reservations." The
proportionate share sought to be charged the Seminole Eation for these
two items is 7.8 cents and 6 cents, respectively. Ehese items appear
more liksly'to represent agency expenses, and they are disallowed as
proper offsets.

21. The defendant seeks to setoff against the award the sum of
$1.68 representing 2.h% of a $70.00 item expended fer transportation of
5,000 lbs. of sugar to the Five Civilized Tribes Ageney in 19h8 (G.A.CL
ReP0Tt; Po 61). No offsets have been.allowed for sums spent for sugar.
This transportation charge is disallowed as an offset. .

22. During the period from July 1, 1951, to June 30, 1956, the
defendant disbursed the sum of $23,863.00 in cash paymnts for indigent

Seminole Indians, as relief grants (Def.'Ex. S7). Thejyearly disbursements were:

1952 s 1,h81.oo
1953 2,278.00
195k 3,986.00
1955 6,S3h.oo
1956 9,S8h.co

Total $23,863.00
N0 figures are available for the Seminole Indian population during this
period. However, the population in 1031 was 1,789 and it increased to

2,000 by 19b3, remaining at that figure during 19b3, l9hh and l9hS. The

amounts paid in relation to the number of Seminole lrnians together with

the te5tim0BY of Mr. Gillies clearly indicates that these payments were
not made on a tribal basis for the benefit of the Seminole Nation but

rather went to individual, needy Seminole Indians. In discuss‘ '=' the

I..»\...v..g. -&-,

ash payments to indigent Inaianszreferred to in Finding of Fact No. l7(b),

the following cross-examination of Mr. Gillies occurred:
Q. In other words, what does the voucher shoe, or
what do the vouchers shoe} with respect to the cash payments to these Indians?

A. The vouchers show relief payment grants and show
names of individual Indians and a case number opposite

each name. It does not identify the Indian by tribe.
(Ir. 305)  
* a a a
Q. Is that true with respect to the $23,863 item

on Page.9 of Defendant‘s Exhibit 58, the last item?

A. ‘Yes, sir. That is true as to those also.

Q. Those were also cash payments to individuals?
A. Yes, sir. trictly cash payments. (Tr. 309)
Since the payments nere for individual indigent Indians and not a

or the tribe, they are not proper offsets.

23. In summation, the only allowable offsets were the funeral
expense gratuities in the total amount of $160.00 referred to in Finding
of Fact No. 17(d). All other items claimed as offsets against the award
are disallowed.

Defendant is allowed to offset $160.00 against the

award of $3h,2l3.66, leaving the sum of $3h,0S3.66, which petitioner is

entitled to recover from defendant.
