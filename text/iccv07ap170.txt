71. Between June 1?, 15343, and June 30, lE‘:};S>, the United States
claims there was expended gratuitously from public funds for the PotaJ.

1-rat  I-‘Eation of Indians the total 51...; of 3‘l7S'.OO for the fol_'Lo1~Iing
purposes:

(a) Recovery of Livestoac, {$21.00. The sum represents an expenditure of $21.00 paid from an appropriation for "Contingencies, Indian
~Depart'.~.ent" (G.A.O. Report, Def. Ex. 100, page 92) under date of September 15, 18126, for the recovery of seven head of cattle belonging to
the Potat-zatomi Lndians which had strayed ‘oacic into the settlements of
E-Eation of Indians at that time

Missouri (Def. &. lOl). The Potat-Iatomi

owned its property communellgr. The payment having been made to recover
tribal property, the item constitutes a tribal benefit allowable as an

offset credit under Section 2 of 60 Stat. 105,9. Osage Nation of Indian

 

v; United ‘States, 3 Ind. c1. (com. hes, n25, n38.
(b) Provisions, :’$lS}.*..OO. Defendant in the amended ans‘-.-zer set
up as an offset against the award the sum of $170.00 comprising certain
items of expenditures for provisions. Defendant concedes (Def. Reg. Fdg.
of Fact 28 (2) that the item’ of $3165.00 set out m its amended answer in
paragraph 111; for the purchase of 17.-Io beeves should not “be allowed as an
offset.

It is not sheen by the evidence the curcose of the council where these
0 . items were provided the Indians. It may well have been a council on a

matter of interest to defendant in which case the items furnished ‘would

constitute "agency" or “administrative” expense. The items making up the

sum.of $28.00 are denied as an offset. Imiani Tr'be of Oklahoma, et al. v.

United States, 5 In‘. Cl. Comm. h9h, S06.

 

(2) The remainder of t;e $l5h.00, claimed by defendant as

fl

an offset, in the amount 01

$126.00 paid fr.“ an appropriation “Provisions
for Indians" consists of the following it.is: the sum.of'$lé.O0 for the

purchase of one beef and one barrel of flour on September l, l8h6 during

a council (Def. l0S~a) and the smns of $32.00 for one beef, $60.00
for 2,000 lbs. of flour and $18.00 for three barrels of flour, all three
of these iteas being expended "for provisions of annuity for the Potafatomies during the l8b6-payment period" (Def. Ex. l0§-3, 105-0, and

_l0S-D). The iten of $16.00 for provisions during a council is denied as

a proper ffset for the reasons set forth above as an administrative or
agency expense. M'”ei case, supra. The item of $32.00, $60.00 and

$18.00, representing sums expended for provisions supplied the Potasatomi

Indians durinr

L!

a pavnent period in October 18b6, totaling $110.00, are

allowed as proper offsets. See Hiami Trice, s*pra, at page 505.

which sums were, according to defendant, expended gratuitously

the year l86h. These items come under two classifications or categories,
(1) Expenses of Indian Delegations and (2) Provisions. The expense of
Indian delegations as set forth in the amended ansser totaled $29h.Sl.
This total was reduced.by defendant to $86.20 by elnninating as a claimed
offset $203.51 expenditures for Potanatomi.Indians who could not be identified as members of the Potanatoni Nation of Indians (Def. Req. Fdg. 29
(2)) and by reducing one item by $h.8O so as not to include board or
expenses attributable to the United States Indian agent. The sum of
$86.20 for expenses of Indian delegations consists of the following sums
paid for tribal members in l863 on a visit to the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs in Leavenworth to transact business for the Potanatomi Tribe:

(Def. “xhibits 108:3, 108-B, I08-C, 108-D). Expenses of Indian Delegations have been allowed as a proper offset in prior cases (The Quaoan

 

Tribe v. United States, l28 C. Cls. D5: 62) and the above items totaling

   

$86.?O are so allowed herein.

(b) In.paragraph hS of defendant's amended answer certain items
for "Provisions" are listed as claimed offsets. The items of $32.00,
$l,Ohl.6S, a:d.$llS.OO were expended from public funds as follows:

(l) $32.00 paid on September 2h, 1853, from public funds
by G.'E.iMannypenny5 Commissioner of Indian Affairs, for'beef, flour,
sugar and coffee (G.A.O. Report, page l2h). A notation on this voucher

(D€_. Ex. ll3) shows-this amount (as does the G..A. 0. Report) was paid

7 Ind. Cl. Conn. 170

from an appropriation "iitinguishing Title'Hest ofiiissouri and Iowa"
(Act ofWKarch 3, 1853, 10 Stat. 238 - see Tr. page The Commission
is aware free its findings of fact in previous cases that Commissioner
Hannypenny was sent west by the President of the United States in the

summer of 1853 to negotiate with the Indian tribes west of'Hissouri and
Iowa for the extinguishment of title of Indians there located to all or

parts of their lands including the Potawatomie Tribe (Finding 3 (b),

The Absentee Shawnee Tribe v. United States, 6 Ind. 01. Comm. 377).

 

Such a negotation was for the benefit of the United States and any expenditures for provisions under these circumstances are therefore denied
as offsets as administrative expense. ‘Miami Tribe, supra, at page S08.
(2) Defendant claims as an offset $l,0hl.6S paid in 1861
under an appropr'ation "for the relief of the destitute Indians % % %
who have failed in raising crops frzm the drouth of last summer [1360 ,
% % %" (Act of“Harch 2, 1861, 12 Stat. 239). According to the report of
the folthe Special.Agent in charge of delivering the relief provisions

lowing were delivered to the Indian agent for the Potanateni:

 

2137 bushels of corn $718.67
11 barrels of pork’ 209.00
27 13/60 bushels of'potatoes 17.69
82 lbs. of bacon 7a§h

Total

$952.90

The difference between the offset clanned, 3l,0hl.6S, and the amount distribued, $952.90, occurs because 26h bushels of corn brought to the Pota0 . o -- so ‘* “-1
watomi reserve was paid in kind to the Indians who used their teams to ha»the supplies to the ag ncy. In view of the amount of provisions delivered

it is apparent that the expenditure resulted in a tribal, rather than
individual, benefit and the sum of $952.90 is allot-red as a proper offset.
(See Def. Exhibits 3.11;, llS, IL6-A to 116-H, incl.)

(3) In paragraph 1.5 of def.'enda.nt‘s arnended answer is set
This total sum consists‘ of two items (a) $$h3.00 for beef , 1._our and bread purchased for
the sustenance of the Potawatomi Indians in July l8SO (Def. Ex. IL8)
during the delivery to the Indians of sundry agricultural and mechanical.
implements, and (2) the expenditureoi‘ $72.00 in may 1851 for 1600 lbs.
of beef purchased for the Potaz-ratozni Indians during the payment of their
annuity (Def.  ll7). with respect to the provisions furnished the
Indians during delivery of he agricultural and mechanical implements
there is no proof that such equipment was not furnished :';‘or educational
purposes. Since the equipment itself must be considered as for educathe contrary, and such items in themtional purposes, without proof to

selves I-:ou_'Ld not be proper offsets (Quapa:-:r Tribe, supra, p. 7l) then the

provisions furnished the Indians at-raiting delivezry of same must be considered agency or administrative expenses and the 33.3.00 for beef, flour
and bread is denied as an offset. The itm shot-:i.g $72.00 paid for the

under appropriation "1ndustria1'3orh and Care of Timber" and the balance
of $l6.87'was charged to the "I. K. P. L. Pott School.” Defendant claim
only the $35.00 as an offset. Defendant's Exhibit 120 is a voucher showing the purchase in 1917 of 3200 lbs. of oats for 360.00 and the voucher
charges this to the appropration "Industrial work and Care of Timber."

Defendant claims the $60.00 as an offset. A voucher, Defendant‘s Exhibit
121, is for the purchase of 13,503 lbs. of bailed prairie hay for $67.51,

and of this an unt $35.00 was charged to the appropriation “Industrial

'1

Work and Care of Timber" and the remainder to "Interest on.Potawatmni,

Gen’1 Fund." Defendant claims only 335.00 of th $67.51 outlay. Disbursement Schedule Ho. D8 of the G. .. 0. Report (Def. Ex. 100) contains
the figures with respect to disbursements for the Potawatomi Indians in
. C2

Kansas under the appropriation "Industrial Work and Care of Timber” for
the fiscal years 1912 through 1919. Only one of the above items claimed
by defendant can be identified in the report and that is $35.00 charged
to this appropriation in 1917 (G..A. 0. Report, p. 130). Under this
appropriation Disbursement Schedule ho. k8 shows sums expended for'the
Prairie Band in the amount of $8,139.25 for the fiscal years 1912 through
1919 for such purposes as pay and expenses of fanners and farm laborers,

purchase of livestock and feed and care of livestock. In the absence of

‘proof to the contrary the items for the purchase of oats and hay totaling
