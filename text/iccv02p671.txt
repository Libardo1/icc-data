OPINION OF THE.’ COMIESSION

 

 WITT, Chief Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.

’ The suit of plaintiffs is based on the Act of Congress of Febru 28', 1877.: Plaintiffs éontend"that".said Actjtook from them 7,345,257
acres of land together with other rights; that said acreage taken was a
part of the Permanent Reservation described in Article 2 .of the Treaty
of. April 29, i 1868, from which valuable ‘gold and silver mines -were subsequently developed in the black Hills region of said territory; that

they received inadequate and unconscionable consideration therefor.

.:.-_ - ".3
   2 672
  Plaintiffs in their original petition allege that the defendant
 3. " ‘-A is liable to  for said acreage and other lands and rights surrenders
  as follows:
 l. Royalties. A. fair and reasonable per cent
.   of the value of gold, silver and other minerals ex   tracted from the Black Hills lands from February 28,

-  Plaintiffs base their claim of liability (subject to be offset

- _, ,
  - -contention _that the consideration provided in the Act of Congress of
   February 28, 1877, requiring the cession of land and surrender of
 rights, was so grossly inadequate as to be unconscionable and was not
"  in keeping with fair and honorable dealings, and was in disregard of
 theduty owed by defendant as guardian to plaintiffs as its wards.

N The defendant pleads several decisions and decrees by the

qCourt of Claims and the Supreme Court as having fully adjudicated

vthe claims asserted by the plaintiffs upon their merits and that
the said decisions are res judicata of the claims asserted. The

defendant also pleads that the consideration paid and promised to

be paid by the defendant for the lands and rights acquired by it

from the plaintiffs under the terms of the Act of February 28, 1877,
was adequate compensation therefor and that it had in every way dealt

fairly and honorably with the plaintiffs.

The plea of res judicata seems not to be seriously urged. lIn
view of the decision hereby rendered on the merits, the question of
whether or not the decisions are res judicata becomesimmaterial.

The defendant contends that the issue as to whether or not the
consideration moving to the Indians under the terms of the Act of
Congress of 1877 is unconscionable is determinable by a comparison
of the market or contemporary value of the lands ceded and rights
surrendered at the time of their cession, todwit, February 28, l877,
with the consideration provided by said Act of Congress.

The plaintiffs‘ theory of liability is that the defendant was
their guardian and that as such guardian was liable to them, not for
the market or contemporary value of the property at the time of its
involuntary taking or cession but for what its development over the
years proved its value to be; that its value by reason of the gold

and silver deposits thereunder was sufficiently known in l877 as to

place upon the defendant the duty of developing it for the benefit

of the plaintiffs as thewards of the defendant, and that not havin
done so said defendant is now liable to the plaintiffs on the basis‘

of what the developmentover the years has shown the value of its

gold and silver deposits to have been. Plaintiffs admit that if the

liability of the defendant is to be determined by the market value

of the lands and rights at the- time of their cession that they have
no claim. J

.The only’. evidence submitted bythe plaintiffs in support of

their theory of liability is the gross value of minerals extracted i
from the lands involved since said lands became .the.property of the '
defendant under the terms of the Act of 1877. ‘The other values relied
upon by the plaintiffs are estimated. In this connection it is to be
noted that the other values as claimed in the original" petition are
not urged in plaintiffs‘ final brief -- that. filed dune l9, 1953, 3.1.
called an Intermediate Brief :-- but that‘timber values are urged on a
royalty basis and that the rights surrendered as to Class B and Class C
lands a rental basis. It is practically admitted that plaintiffs‘

claims are primarily based on the valuable minerals later extracted

from the Black Hills portion of the 7,345,157 acres required to be

ceded, plaintiffs contending in said Intermediate Brief (p. 8) that the
"total of royalties and rentals which plaintiffs would (and should) have
received from January 1, l87A7 to January 1, l953", but for the cessions

and surrenders required of them by. the Act of February 28, 1877, would

have been $118 , 912 ,809. 00.

As contrasted with the $118,912,809 as royalties and rents
that plaintiffs allege under the proven and estimated production
for minerals and rents they would have received, plaintiffs admit

receiving from the defendant in actual and estimated appropriations

under the terms of the Act of February 28, 1877, a total of $57,048,106.
(Intermediate Brief, p. 9).

By reason of the disparity between these figures, plaintiffs contend that they have proven that the consideration received by them under
the Act of February 28, 1877, was unconscionable and that defendant is
liable to them for additional compensation for the lands and rights
taken from.them by the defendant under the terms of said Act of Congress.

The defendant supports-its contention that the market or contemporary value of the lands involved is the correct basis for determining

whether or not the consideration moving to the Indians was unconscionablel

by citing a long line of decisions in its Memorandum filed July 30, 1953,
so holding. These decisions are in keeping with what has been the uniform holdings of the Courts as the basis of the Government's liability
to Indians for the taking or acquiring of their lands.

As heretofore stated, plaintiffs do not contend that the consideration received by the Indians is unconscionable if the value of the lands
and rights acquired by the defendant is the market or contemporary value
of same as of date February 28, 1877; but they say in the instant case
that the defendant knew on February 28, l877, that minerals in paying
quantities underlay the surface of the Black Hills lands and that it

was the duty of the defendant—as their guardian to develop said property

as a trust for their benefit as its wards, and that not having done

so it has become liable to them.as its wards for a royalty on the

‘gold and silver subsequently extracted therefrom.

If plaintiffs are correct in their contentions as to the proper
ayardstick by which to measure defendant‘s liability, which this Commission finds it unnecessary to decide, we are of the opinion that they
have not shown even on their own theory of liability the right to
-recover." In this connection we will give consideration to the
situation existing as between the defendant Government and the
plaintiff Indians at the time of the passage of the Act involved; that
is, February 28, 13773

The area from which valuable mineral deposits were thereafter
extracted had been set apart for the absolute and undisturbed use an
occupation of plaintiff Indians by the Treaty of April 29, 1868. Under
this treaty the Government assumed an obligation, among others, to
provide food and subsistence for all Indians of the tribe for a period
of.4 years. The population of the tribe was between 20,000 and 30,000.
This obligation was fulfilled through the necessary appropriations annually for the term stipulated and was finally discharged by an appropriation of $1,314,000 on February 14, 1873, for subsistence for the

year ending June 30, l874, -- the total amount appropriated for the 4

years being $5,295,76l.95. After that no legal obligation rested upon

the Government to expend public funds for subsistence of the plaintiffs

that the Black Hills portion of the reservation contained some gold, but

the fact that the Black Hills contained gold was not known to the general

public until 1874. After that date there was a tide of emigration of
settlers and miners to the Black Hills region in ever-increasing numbers.
Public pressure for the opening of the Black Hills for settlement and
nuning became very strong. Negotiations were undertaken to secure a

cession or sale by the Indians of the Black Hills portion of their

"reservation. It proved impossible to secure as provided by Article 12

of the Treaty of 1868 the assent and signatures of three-fourths of the
male adult Indians of the tribe. Finally, however, the assent and signatures of less than 10 per cent of the male adult members of the tribe
‘were secured to an agreement which was made the basis of the.Act of

February 28, 1877. The chiefs and headmen of the tribe

, however, were

pamong those assenting to the terms of the agreement which were embodied in the Act of February 28, 1877. '~
Plaintiffs admit total appropriations made by the defendant for

them.under the provisions of the Act of February 28, 1877, to January 1,

1953, (actual and estimated) $57,048,106. In addition to these appropriations the Act of 1877 gave the Indians about 917,000 additional acres
of grazing land, and said Act provides a continuing obligation on the
part of the defendant to appropriate and disburse such sums as should be

necessary for their subsistence "until the Indians are able to support

themselves. The defendant alleges that said obligation for the future,

‘while uncertain in amount and duration, it believes appropriations in

excess of $750,000 annually (as in the past) will be required for many

-more years.‘

At the time of the legislation which is the basis of the comp.;p1a:u.-.:, the Black Hills area (from which the gold and silver was

extracted) was surrounded almost on .all sides by white settlers;
railroads were in operation, the Southern Pacific to the south and
the Northern Pacific tothe north, and the Missouri River carried
heavy traffic in steamboats; thus facilities were open to white
settlers within a short distance of the Black Hills gold fields.

-,  lrouble had arisen in the years immediately prior thereto between
the Government and certain of the Sioux Indians "in. connection with the
survey and construction of the Northern Pacific Railroad. War was the
result and during the years l876 and 1.877 military compaigns had been.
made against certain bands of the Sioux Indians. The famous Custer
Exploration Expedition occurred in 1874 and the so-called Custer Massacre

took place in July 1876. Following the Custer Exploration Expedition

hereinbefore mentioned and the accounts made -public in that year of the

t . discovery of gold in that region, public pressure for the opening of

the Black Hills country for mining increased. The Government through
its military establishment endeavored to keep white settlers and gold
prospectors out of the Black Hills territory within the Sioux Reservation but this was almost impossible.- In his annual report for the a

fiscal year 1875 the Comissioner of Indian Affairs,-reporting on the

black Hills condition, stated:

The occupation and possession of the Black Hills
by white men seems now inevitable, * * '*

The Comnissioner, in this same report, also states:

* * * However unwilling we may be to confess it,
the experience of the past summer proves either the
inefficiency of the large military force under the
comand of such officers as General Sheridan, Terry,
and Crook, or the utter impracticability of keeping
Americansout of a country where gold is known to
exist by any_fear of orders or of United States cavalry,

. or by. any consideration of the rights of others.

-Said report further says with reference to the Indians: A

_. _ * ‘* ** They are not now capable of self-support;
they are absolute pensioners of the Government in the
sum of a million and a quarter of dollars annually
above all amounts specified in treaty stipulations.
failure to receive Government rations for a single
season would reduce them to starvation.

A

The report further comments with reference to the joint occupancy
of the gold country by the Indians and whites, as ‘follows:

* * '* So long as gold exists in the same region,
_ fthe agriculuzralg country surrounding- the gold fields
will be largely required _to .support the miners, and
- n .to attempt to bring the wild Sioux into proximity to
the settlers and miners would be to invite provocations
- and bloody hostility. ' - S '

L‘ Said report also mentions the fact that the Indians were making
but little if any use of the Blackhills country."

‘While the treaty of 1868, as its provisions show, contemplated
that the Indians, with the assistance therein provided to berendered
them by the Government, would soon become self-supporting on the
reservation, the appropriation of $1,314,000 under the Act of

February -14, l873, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1871», was

the final obligation of said treaty for the subsistence of the Indians.

Gratuity appropriations followed in the amount of $2,350,000, but they

had not become self-sustaining and would be starving unless further

‘Government aid_be provided.

Notwithstanding conditions as aforesaid, the efforts of several

Commissions to negotiate an agreement in strict conformity with Article
12 of the Treaty of 1868 for the relinquishment or sale to the Governme:
of the Black Hills had failed because more than 90 percent of the India:
refused to sell or lease the Black Hills and relinquish their hunting
rights to the Government at any price. Some of the Indians were willing
to lease the mining rights in the Black Hills to the Government for a
consideration of $70,000,000 or for full subsistence for every Sioux
Indian (then numbered between 20,000 and 30,000) from.that date, so

The agreement finally signed in October l8?¢
and made the basis of the Act of Congress of February 28, 1877, (which

provided the consideration herein previously mentioned for the cession

and relinquishments therein made by the Indians), was assented to and

signed bv the chiefs and headmen of the tribe but by less than 10
percent of the male adult Indians.

This Commission has taken judicial notice of the fact that the
United States Government has never at any time and does not at this

time require the payment of a royalty for the extraction of gold or

silver from its public lands, and not until l9l9 did the Government

require payment of any royalty for the privilege of mining or extracting

“royalty provided then and provided now permits the same to be as little

- as 5 percentum of the net value of the output: of the minerals at the

mine.

the negotiations over the years with the Indians showed a
strenuously sincere effort on" the part of the defendant Government to
reach a fair basislof cession of the gold and silver producing lands

by the Indians to .the Government. It was obvious that ,the Indians

"could not subsist on the gold and silver that might lie buried in

their hills; it was as obvious that the Indians themselves could not

extract,-these minerals and develop commercial mines. It was equally

yobviousthat regardless of the effort through the military or otherwise on the part of the Government to prevent the whites from emigrating into the mining territory  the development by them of the
mines great. hostilities‘ would result between the whites and Indians
and much bloodshed ‘on the partsof both. It was a practical necessity
that the lands be acquired the defendant and made available to the
white miners, and doubtless the economy of the country was taken into
consijderation in theneed of gold and silver bullion; These considerations together with the further fact that the Indians needed pro- '

tection not only as against hostilities and their resulting bloodshed,

but also fromstarvation-by'reason of lack of food -- the wild life of

the region having at this time almost disappeared ---made the acquisition

of the mineral lands and the payment of a‘ fair consideration to the

Indians therefor an absolute necessity -- as much in the Indians‘ own

interest as for any other reason.

The extent of the mineral deposits at the time were of course

problematical. l'l'he prospectors were not provided with the geological
and scientific information of the present date, and whether or not
gold and silver of_ the value of 40 million or 400 million dollars or
more underlay the lands involved was not determinable. Methods of

mining at that time were primitive and the cost of the extraction

of the minerals was almost an unknown amount.

It is obvious that no one on February 28, 1877 , knew whether the
consideration provided for the Indians would prove to be ten times the

value of the gold taken from the hills or one-tenth of the value; but
it was necessary to prevent bloodshed of whites and ‘Indians to make

lands available for mining «or whatever gold and silver that could be

- found, and provide for the subsistence of the Indians for the future.
a It is obvious that no one could Imow whether the liability assumed by

-the defendant under the terms of the_Act of February 28, 1877, would

ever be realized by the defendant or its white citizens from the lands
We have therefore concluded that under the circumstances and facts at that time as we find
them to be, that there is no basis for a claim or -claims by the plaintiffs that the compensation provided for the Indians under the Act of
february 28, 1877, was inadequate or unconscionable, or that the

defendant was guilty of unfair or- dishonorable dealings, or failed in

amounted over the years to many millions of dollars and will provide
many more millions of dollars regardless of the quantity of gold or
% silver that might be found in the Black Hills, were fully adequate
-under the circumstancesrequired  the situation at the time.
h Our Findings of Fact are lengthy and it seems unnecessary in

this opinion to repeat or paraphrase any more than we have done.

iUEREFORE,' the petition of the plaintiffs must be dismissed.“
