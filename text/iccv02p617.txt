The Commission makes the following findings of fact;

1.

The petitioners in Docket No. 67 are entitled to institute

and maintain a claim under the Indian claims Commission Act arising out

of the cessions made by the Miami Tribe on October 6, 1818.

(This finding is not intended to be a finding granting to
petitioners in Dht. 67 the exclusive right to maintain such
claim; nor to in anywise affect the determination of the
right of the petitioners in Docket 12% to maintain a claim
under the Indian Claims Commission Act based on the cession
of October 6 1818, which question remains for future

determination.)

The defendant in its brief at pages 3, 9 and U0 admits the correct'ness of the above finding and eliminates the same as an issue in the

ease, and it is, therefore, thought unnecessary to make evidentiary findings as to the evidence upon which same is based.

2. The United States recognized the exclusive title of the Miami
Tribe to the land ceded on October 6, 1818 (being.Area 99 according to
30YC8'S Map of Indiana) subject only to_similar1y recognized interests

in the Delaware and Wes tribes.

EVIDENTIARY FINDINGS IN SUPPORT OF BASIC FINDING N0. 2

 

The Miami tribe originally included both the Eel Rivers and the

Weas.

In the treaty of Grouseland, August 21, 1805, 7 Stat. 91, the

, United states stipulated that "the tribes which are now called the

Miamies, Eel Rivers and Weas were formerly and still consider themselves one nation." On March 22, 181%, General William Henry Harrison,
then territorial governor, wrote to the Secretary of war;

“The Miamies have their principal settlements at the forks
— of the Wabash, thirty miles from fort Wayne; and at
Mississineway, thirty miles lower down. A band of them
under the name of Weas, have resided on the Wabash sixty
miles above Vincennes; and another under the Turtle on
E61 River, a branch of the Wabash, twenty miles northwest
of fort wayne. By an artifice of the Little Turtle these
three bands were passed on general Wayne as distinct
tribes, and an annuity was granted to each. The Eel River
and Weas however to this day call themselves Miamies, and
are recognized as such by the Mississineway band ***.#

The Eel Rivers remained at all times a part of the Miami. The
Weas had their settlements well to the west of those of the other
constituent bands of the Miami Nation. The Wea country was in the
western part of Indiana, along the Wabash.River, north of Vincennes.
In the 1809 treaty negotiations, the Miami chiefs repeatedly referred
to the land on the Wabash itself as occupied by the wees, "our younger

brotherot" Despite the efforts of Governor Harrison in 1809 to

peraiade the Weas of the advantages of “removing from the neighoorhood

of Yincennes and settling higherlup the country with their older
brothers, the I-iiaznies", the Stress, as late as18l8, contimed to occupy
land in western Indiana along" the Wabash River. By the treaty of
October 2, 1818, -7 Stat. 186, the Heas ceded to the United States
all the lands claimed or owned by then in Indiana, except for a small
reservation on the Wabash River in the Western part of Indiana (Boyce,
Area 111+) . . H

The treaty of Grouseland of 1805, which recopized the Weas as
belonging to the Miami Nation was actually the last Miami treaty in
which the ‘trees directly participated. The treaty of September 30, 1809,
7 Stat. 113, 115, was negotiatedwith the Miamis, including the Eel
Rivers, at Fort wayne, without the presence of any idea delegates. A
supplenentary article to this treaty, 7 Stat. 115, stated that "the
greater part‘ of the lands ceded to the Unitedustates, by the treaty
this  concluded, was the exclusive property of the Miami Nation and
guaranteed to then by the treaty of Grouseland."  consent to that
part of the treaty which affected lands within the Wea domination was
obtained at Vincennes by the separate convention of October 26, 1809,
7 Stat. 116, following separate negotiations with the Wea chiefs.
Following the 1809 treaties, there was no apparent treaty connection,
even to the ‘extent to requiring consent, between the Miami Iiation and
the Weas. During the War of 1812 a. peace treaty was made on ‘behalf I
of thelniamie (September 8, 1815, 7 Stat. 131), more than eleven months

before a similar peace treaty was mde by the Weas (August 21:-, 1815,
7 Stat. 1146).

r The Miamis did not participate in the treaty of the Wee. tribe of

October 2, 1818, nor did the Weas participate in the cession of

October 5, l8l8, by the Miami Nation. Two years later, the I-teas removed

completely from Indiana (Wee treaty of Vincennes, August 11, 3.820, 7 stat.

on August 3,‘ l795, at Greenville, ad. treaty of peace was entered
into between the United States, represented by General Anthony Wayne,
and "the tribes of Indians, called the wyandots, Delawares, Sbawa-noes,
otta.was, chipewas, Putawatines, Miamis, ddzel-river, weea's, Kiclcapoos,
Piankaehaws, and Ka.sk'a.sk:ias.' Article III of the treaty fired “the
general boundary line between the lands of the United States and the
lands-of said Indian tribes" and exacted certain cessions from the
Indians. Article I? provided. that

"the United States relinquish their claims to all other

Indian lands northward of the river Ohio, eastward of

the Mississippi, and westward and southward of the Great
lakes and the waters uniting them, according to the
boundary line agreed on by the United States and the king

subject to certain excepted tracts.

Area 99 is on the Indians‘ side of the Greenville treaty line and
within the area egressly relinquished to the Indians.

Article V provided as follows:

"To prevent any misunderstanding about the Indian lands
relinquished by the United States in the fourth article,
it is now explicitly declared, that the meaning of that
relinquishment is this: The Indian tribes who have a.
right to those lands, are quietly to enjoy them, hunting,
planting, and dwelling thereon so long as they please,
without any molestation from the United States; but when
those tribes, or any of them, shall be disposed to sell
their lands, or any part of them, they are to be sold
only to the United- States; and until such sale, the United
States will protect all the said Indian tribes, in the
quiet enjoyment of their lands against all citizens of
the United States, and against all other white persons
who intrude upon the same. and the said Indian tribes
agin acknowledge themselves to be under the protection
of the said United States and no other power whatever,"

No part of Area 99 was ceded to the United. States by the treaty

of ,A:ugu.st 21, 1805, 7 Stat. 91, called the treaty of Grouselend or by i

any former treaty.

Both before and after the treaty of Grouseland the title of the
Miami Nation to the country on the -Wabash, including Area 99, was
consistently and continuously recognized by the responsible officials
of the United States, subject only to the interests of the Delawares
in the white River country, as herein above noted, and, after the
separation of the Weas, to the rights of the Weas as former members
of the Miami Nation.

Indiana, but also the sole ‘treaty commissioner in all treaties of

cession made by the Miamis and other tribes in the area between 183

and l809 had acknowledged Miami title to the country on the Wabash as

early as March 3, 1803. In a report to the Secretary of War on that

date, Governor Harrison stated:

"The Potawatomies so far from having any claim to land on
the South East side of the Wabash acknowledge that they
have trespassed upon the Miamis by settling on the north
bank of that river and it has been an object with the
Turtle and Wells for several years to get them to remain."

In a similar report made to the Secretary of War on August 26, 1805,

reporting on the treaty of Grouseland, Harrison stated:

“The admission of the Pattawatamies, as a party to the
treaty, could. not well be avoided, under the circumstances which gave rise to the conference, and I am
confident that it will eventually be highly advantageous
to us. They have given up all right to interfere in any
future sales of lands by the Miamies, on the Wabash and
its waters. The guarantee of those lands to the three
tribes, who call themselves Miamies, could not be
avoided, as they insisted upon it with the most persevering obstinacy. But, I conceive that it will be no
difficult matter to get them, in the course of a few
years, to make a division of the ‘land that they now
hold in common. at any rate, a point of much consequence hss been gained, by getting the other tribes to
acknowledge their exclusive title to the country on the
Wabash, above the Vincennes tract."

In negotiations at Ft. Wayne on October 30, l809, ‘Ea.rrison~ reported

that the chief of the Eel River Miamis

"drew out the Treaty of Grouseland. ‘Father--Here are
your own words, in this paper you promised that you
would consider the Miamies as the owners of the land on
the Wabash. Why then are you about to purchase it from
others '1" The Governor assured them that it never was
his intention to purchase the land from the other Tribes,
that he had always said and was ready now to confess that
the land belonged to the Miamies and to no other Tribe.

III

,; “*** it was not the intention of the Governor to put
'3 anything in the Treaty which would in the least alter

their claim to their lands on the Wabash, as established
by the Ereaty of Grouseland unless they chose to satisfy
the Delawares with respect to their claim to the Countr*
Watered by the White River."

]."t&:o.-at 8

Following the execution of the treaty of 1809, in whi h the “ o~‘
and Bel Rivers ceded certain tracts within the country on the wabash
and its waters, a supplementary treaty was entered into with the

Hiamis and Eel Rivers which recited that:

"the greater part of the lands ceded to the United States,

xhifi by the treaty this day concluded was the exclusive pro_’.w party of the hiami Eation.and guaranteed to them by the

treaty of Grouseland.“
In reporting on the l809 treaties, Earrison stated to the Secretary of her on November 3, l809:

“The Treaty as it now stands is nearly what the Miamis
wished-the other Tribes have been admitted to it only
as their allies, and their title to the lands on the
Wabash left in statu E33.“

In a further report made by Harrison to the territorial legislature of Indiana on November 12, l8lO, the Governor stated:

"Upon this principle, in several of the treaties which
have been made, tribes have been admitted to a participation in their benefits who had no title to the lands

ceded, merely because They had been accustomed to hunt
upon and derive part of their support from them. For

‘hit this reason, and to prevent the Miamies, who were the
':--‘_i -q . an

.ag real owners of the land, from experiencing any ill ezrects,
jf,f from their resentment, in case they were excluded, the

.. ... A-us §...'.. lg

Delawares, Putawatamies, and Kichapoos, were made parties
to the late treaty of Fort Wayne. No other tribe was
admitted because it never had been suggested that any other
could plead even the title of use or occupancy of the lands

:92; l which.at that time were conveyed to the United States.“

Reporting to the Secretary of War onliarch 22, 18111», h'arrison

stated:

"The Miamies, Maumees, or Tewicktovies, are the undoubted
proprietors of all that beautiful country which is watered
by the Wabash and its branches; and there is as little
doubt, that their claim extended at least as far east as
the Scioto. They have no tradition of removing from any
other quarter of the country; whereas all the neighboring
tribes, the Piankishaws, excepted, who are a branch of

the Miamies, are either intruders upon them, or have been
permitted to settle in their country.

ill

"The question of the title to the lands south of the
Wabash has been thoroughly examined; every opportunity
was afforded to Tecumseh and his party to exhibit their
pretensions, and they were found to rest upon no other
basis, than that of their being the common property of
all the Indians. \ The Potawatamies and Kiclgapoos have
unequivocally acknowledged the Miami and Delaware title."

By its cession of Area 99 in l8l8, the Miami tribe divested itself

of all of its lands on the Wabash and its waters, lying south of the

Wabash River itself, except for the reservations reserved‘by the treaty.

The Potawatomies in the preceding years had encroached upon the Miami

territory on the north bank of the Habash and had acquired, by such

- encroachment and possibly by permission of the Miamis, a common interest

with the Miamis in the country north of the Wabash. By the treaty of

October 2, 1818, 7 stat. 186, the Potawatomies ceded a tract of land

north of the Wabash (Royce Area 98) and also quit-claim‘ed to the

United States ‘all their claim to the country south of the Wabash River.“

This quit-claim was exacted because "it was considered important" by the

United States, not because of any occupancy by the Pottawatomies south

of the Wabash. In October, 1.826, the United States negotiated with both

the Miamis and the Potawatomies for cession of their lands north of the

‘Jabash. The Potawatomies, by treaty of October 16, 1826, 7 Stat. 295,

ceded. two additional tracts north of the Wabash. The I-iianis, by tr ty

of October 23, 1826, 7 Stat. 300, ceded their lands north and west of

the tfabash and Miami Rivers and north and west of Area 99.

Lewis case, who was one of the treaty commissioners in the Miami
treaty of October 6, l8l8, was also a treaty commissioner in the
treaties of l826. In a. letter to the Secretary of War dated October 23,

1826, Cass and his fellow treaty commissioners reported as follows:

"It is difficult to ascertain the precise boundary
of Indian claims. The lines of demarcation between the
different tribes are not distinctly established, and, in
fact, their title rests more upon possession than prescription. The tribes are frequently intermingled, and
each has sometimes a common interest in the same district
of country. North of the wabash, the Mianzies and Potts»wataniiesere in this ‘condition. At the treaty of Grouseland in August l305 the right of the former tribe to

the country upon thewabash and its tributaries was re-_cognized, but time and subsequent circumstances have‘
materialy affected this arrangement. At the treaty of
St. Mary’ s, in 1818, it was considered important to procure a cession from the Pottawatamies of the country south
of the Wabash, and the entire cession from the Vermilion
to the Tippecanoe (Royce 98) was made by that tribe; and
it seemed to be generally admitted by both of these tribes
that there was a. common and undefined interest in the

country north of the Wabash. These circumstances rendered

_it proper to treat with the Miamies and Pottawatamies for

the whole tract to be purchased, in order as well to do
justice by them, as to prevent a resort to hostilities,
the usual arbiter of Indian disputes.

“In treating, however, with the Pottawatamies, we
were "sensible that their title to the most valuable
section of the country was not as valid as that of the

Miamios, and therefore the consideration paid to them
is much less than that paid to the others.

"""""" The. district embraced in the Miami cession is

probably equal in value to any other tract of similar
extent in the western country; and its acquisition was

highly important to the State of Indiana, as it interrupts

the continuity of her settlements, and prevents her from
entering upon that system of internal improvements to
which she is invited by nature, policy, and interest .
The right conveyed by the Miamies is also more extensive
than that conveyed by the Pottawatanies, The latter
have ceded their right to the country within specific
bounds. To the largest and mich the most important of
the three cessions made by them, the Miami claim is the
most valid."

 

‘ I‘our years‘ai'ter the Grouseland treaty of 1805, in which the I-Ieas
were recognized as part of the Miami Nation and as “Joint owners" with
the Miamis "of all the country on the Wabash and its waters,” negotiations for further cessions were comenced with the same tribes who

-had been parties to the srmseland treaty. In these negotiations,

Governor Harrison, as well as the tribes themselves, proceed
upon the assumption that the Weas  a controlling interest in the
area which they actually occupied. or: controlled (in western Indiana),
but had_no interest in the land outside or the area of actual Wea
domination or occupancy.

In the negotiations at Ft. Wayne, attended by the Miamis (including Eel Rivers), the Potawatomies and the Delauares, the Miami
chiefs refused to discuss the cession of western lands occupied by the
Weaé, stating: ‘We have nothing to say to (these lands) at present as
the visas are not here.“ on the other hand, in dealing with the rest
of the territory under discussion, the Miamis insisted upon their own
exclusive title, as guaranteed by the treaty of Grouseland. In subsequent negotiations with the I-Ieas at ‘Vincennes, emphasis was placed

upon their removal from the placetof their actual residence, then "in

the neighborhood of Yincennes." Nothing appears in the lengthy journal

about any Wea interest in Miami lands outside of the Wea occupancy.

This interpretation of the Wea interest is directly reflected in
the treaties of 1809. By article 1 of the treaty of September 30,
1809, "the Miami and Eel River tribes, and the Dela.wares and Pet‘ 1-Iatimies as their allies", agreed to cede to the United States two
tracts of land, Royceis Areas ‘fl and 72. Both areas were within "the

country on the Wabash and its waters" referred to in the treaty of

1805. Area 71 was located in southwestern Indiana, its western border

«-being the Wabash River itself; thus, the westernmost portion of Area 7'1

lay within the lands actually occupied by the Weas. Area 72, hot-:ever,t
was in eastern Indiana, well outside the area of Wes. occupancy.

Article 5 of the treaty of September 30, 1809 provided that “the

consent of the Hea tribe shall be necessary to complete the title of

the first tract oi‘ land here ceded", being Area 71. This, consent was

subsequently, given. (ftfea treaty of October 26, 1809.) No I-{ea consent,

however, was required or obtained for _the cession of Area 72, which
was neither occupied or controlled by the Weas, nor were the '.'.'eas
asked to consent to the Miami recognition of a Delaware half interest
in the White River country, which was also outside the ‘sea dominion.

I Similarly, no considerationfor the cession of Area 72 was given.
to the Weas. however, the weas did receive consideration for their

consent to the cession of Area 71. They also received consideration

for consenting to the cession of Area 73 (directly west of Area Tl),

to which the Kiclmpoos also consented.

The Wee title as a "Joint owner" with the other constituent tribes

of the Miami Nation, as recogized at Grouseland, may at one time have

been deemed to be an undivided interest in the entire Miami dor.:;.in.
The treaty developments of 1809, however, indicate-that this recognised interest was modified, by all the parties to the Grouseland treaty’, including the Visas and the United States, to constitute
a right of exclusive occupancy to that portion of the recognized
lands which the Weas occupied or controlled. Before l8l8 the wees

had separated from the Miami Nation and the Weas and Miamis there? after disposed of their respective lands without requiring the

mutual consent provided in the Grouseland. treaty.

These developments indicate that by 1818 the lands recognized at
Grouseland to have been within the “joint ownership“ of the_tribes
constituting the Miami Nation had undergone a process similar to
that of a partition proceeding, with the result that the glee. interest
was that of an exclusive occupancy right to the ‘territory occupied or
controlled by the Weas, while the balance of the Miami lands belonged
exclusively to the tribes still remaining  the Miami Nation.

The boundary of the country watered by the white River is indicated

‘on the map in evidence as Petitioners’ B.rh.ibit'9§. The acreage and

location of this White River country have been stipulated.

During the 18th century, “the Delawares had, with the approbation
of the I-Iiamies, removed from the mouth oi‘ the Anglaize to the head
waters of the white river, a ‘branch of.‘ the Wabash." (See Harrison
report, 1811;) . H

In a. treaty between the United States and the Delawares node at
Vincennes on August 18, l8C»)3-L, 7 Stat. 81 (whereby the Delawares ceded
Area 14-9), the United States undertook to acknowledge the title of the
Delawares to Area 56. The ytiiiiamis, who were notrepresented at the
l801l- treaty, immediately protested._ Accordingly, at the treaty of
C-rouseland on August 21, 1805, the Delawares relinquished their claim
to Area 56 in favor of the I-iiamis, acknowledging that Delaware occupancy
was merely by I-Iiami s'u£fera.nce'. By the same Grouseland treaty, Area 56
was ceded to the United States by ‘the Hiamis, and Miami title to the
country on the Wabash was aclcnox-xledgedr

it appears from the negotiations at Ft. Hayne preceding the treaty
of 1809 that, despite, the recognition of  title in the treaty of
Grouseland, the Delawares continued to urge "their claim to the country

watered by the White River." Recognition by the Miamis of the Delawa:‘es'

"equal rights” was given only after the exclusive title_set forth in the

treaty of Grouseland to the rest of the Wabash country had been confirmed,

-Dela;-rares in the 1809 cessions made by the Miamis would be "as allies of
the Miamis, not as having any right to the land.»

When these assurances had been given; the United States an the
Deleweree, Potawatomis, I-Iiamis, and Eel Rivers entered into the treaty
of September 30, 1309, 7 Stat. 1.13, which provided;

“The Ieliamis explicitly acknowledge the equal right of the

Delawares with themselves to the country watered by the

White River.“

Governor Harrison. letercited, as an example of title recognition:

"the lands watered by the Wabash,‘ which were declared to

be the property of the Miamies, with the exception of the

tract occupied by the Delawares on Yfhite river , which was

to be considered the joint property of them and the Iviianies."

5. Neither the Potawetomies, Kic1:'a.poos'nor Six Nations, on whose
behalf intervening petitions have been filed, had. any right, title or
interest in Area. 99 at or about the times of the cessions of October,

The Potat-retomis. Ito evidence is in the record to support any

claim of title on the part of the Potawatomis to Area 99. The Potawatoznis,

who were parties to the treaties -of l805 and 1809, expressly concurred
in the recognition of ezclbisive Miami-title,‘  of the Wee. and Deleware interests, es set forth in those ‘treaties. (PX l7, 20) . The
Potawetomis participated in the treaties only as "allies" of the I-iianis;
they neither had. nor. claimed any interest  the ‘lands ceded (PI l7,
81$. 2'; PX 20, art. 1, 9; Journal, l809r,.PI 23; see also &'rison1s

EV 33333? Of October 2, 1818 (PSI 32), the Potawatomis ceded to the

United States a tract of land north of the Wabash River (Area 98) a.:~.c1
in the same treaty qait-claimed to the United States “all their c3_g,j_,-3

of title or occupancy: to anylands south of the ivabash (e,g., 23 15),
and they   ach'n.ovledged  title to these lands. {the only

Potawatomi interest  the Wabash country  north of the Wabash River,

and therefore ontside_of_Area 99 . (See evidence cited under Ewing 19.

The petitioners in Dockets 915-D  311, representing Potawatoni
bands, have indicated in their motionsxfor leave to intervene that,
despite thorough researc_h,'“they cannot find ” evidence to support any

claim of Potawatomi title to  part  ‘Area. 99 .

to nor of any Kickapoo territory within Area 99. On the contrary, the

petitioners in Doc1cetNo. 315, who have intervened. on behalf of the Eiclzapoos, have stated that extensive evidence uncovered after thoro sh

investigation indicates:

"(l) what the Kiciapoo Nation never lived upon lands
southeast of the Wabash River within Area 99 prior to the
“idle of. the Eighteenth century, and that subsequent
Zidaxooo use of such territory, if any, occurred with the
permission of the wee and Miami Tribes ; which originally

' resided thereon.

11(2) That the Kicloapoo ‘Nation never occupied any
territory southeast of the Wabash River within Area 99
at any time, with the possible exception of a major village
on the edge of, or just within, that tract, which apparentl
was destroyed by United States troops in 1791.

"(3) That the Kickapoo Nation never ‘occupied all or
any portion of the lands southeast of the Wabash River
within Area No. 99 after 1795." The petitioners therefore conclude:‘ i

=(1) That the relinquishnent bf lands ‘on the Wabash
river, or any of its waters‘ contained in the August 30
treaty applied only to territory west and north of the
main branch of that river; and ' v

"(2) That the relinquishment of lands ‘on the
southeast side of the Wabash river‘ contained in the
July 30 treaty was a mere confirmatory quit-claim oi‘
interests which in fact did not "exist."

The six Nations. It is apparent from the petition filed in

 

Docket No. 89 that the Six Nations never claimed eitheraboriginal
or recogtized title to amr lands in western Ohio or Indiana, but
only some sort oi’ sovereignty with respect to cessions made by the
western tribes owning such lands. (Pet.  No. 89, yr. 1&6, C) .
