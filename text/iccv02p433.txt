THE. YAKIMA TRIBE or INDIANS, ' )
Petitioner, ;
v_ g Docket No. 47
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 3
Defendant. 3
Filed: May 29, 1953

FINDINGS OF FACT

The Commission.makes the following Findings of Fact:

1.

2 433

The Yakima Tribe of Indians, the petitioner, is comprised of

fourteen separate bands or groups of Indians which confederated together and negotiated the treaty of June 9, 1855, l2 Stat. 95l, II

Kapp. 698, ratified March 8, 1859. It is authorized to institute

these proceedings under the Indian Claims Commission Act.

2. Under the treaty of June 9, 1855, the Yakima Indians ceded

a large area in the present_State of Washington, and reserved therefrom

for their use and occupation the lands situate within the following

boundary set forth in.Article 2 of said treaty:

Commencing on the Yakama River, at the mouth

of the Attah-nam River; thence westerly along said
ttah-nam River to the forks; thence along the

southern tributary to the Cascade Mountains; thence
southerly along the main ridge of said mountains, '
passing south and east of Mount Adams, to the spur

‘whence flows the waters of the Klickatat and Pisco
Rivers; thence down said spur to the divide between
the waters of said rivers; thence along said divide
to the divide separating the:waters of the Satass
River from those flowing into the Columbia River;

thence along said divide to the main Yakama, eightmiles below the mouth of the Satass River; and thence

 1
*ii,{1 up the Yakama River to the place of beginning.
.,

-”3;%§ 3. For the purpose of.locating the boundary of the lands so

reserved for the use and benefit of the petitioner, the defendant

lg; caused the same to be surveyed and definitely fixed the boundary of

such reservation to be as follows:

Commencing at the mouth of the Ahtanum.Creek
down the Yakima River to the range line between
ranges 21 and 22 in Township 9; thence south along
the range line to the township corner; thence on a
line south 86° west to the summit of the Horse Heaven
Hills; thence along said.summit west to Grayback Peak;
thence in a direct line to Goat Butte on the east slope
of Mt. Adams, northwesterly to the summit of the Cascade
Mountains and north along that summit to Goat Rocks;
: thence west along the summit of the Klickton Divide to
f Spencer Point; thence westerly in a straight line to the
"{ headwaters of Reservation Creek; down Reservation Creek

I I n
5-4.-o'.~..;a. .4‘. .. 313...‘.

and the South Fork of the Ahtanum Creek to its mouth,
and then down the main Ahtanum Creek to the point of beginning.

For a more definite description of such boundary reference is hereby
made to Defendant's Exhibit No; 2, in which the boundary is bordered

by blue'shading, and Claimant's Exhibit No. l, in which the boundary

line is shown by a black broken line.

“: I

*;;,g +. In fixing and definitely locating the boundary of said

reservation, as set forth in paragraph 3 above, the defendant erroneously excluded from the lands reserved for the use and occupation of

petitioner by said treaty an area of land lying north of the northerly

.'§ '

,,jf§ boundary of such reservation, as fixed by defendant, bounded as follows:

, Commencing at the junction of Reservation Creek
(as now known) and South Fork Ahtanam Creek (referred
to as the southern tributary of Attah—man river in
the treaty), thence up South Fork Ahtanam Creek to its
headwaters, thence following the crest of the divide

around the headwaters of the Klickitat river
by way of Darling (also known as Darland)
‘Mountain to Spencer Point (about section 10,

Tp. 12 N of Range 12 E), thence in a straight _
line easterly to the head of Reservation Creek,

thence up Reservation Creek to the place of
beginning.

The acreage of this area is not separately shown, although the part
of this area lying within the boundary starting at the head of Reservation Creek, instead of South Fork Ahtanam.River, was determined to
be 16,448 acres. Isee Pl. Ex. 3l, Earnard‘Map). If this acreage is
acceptable to the parties, there need be added only the acreage lying
between the South Fork Ahtanam.River and Reservation Creek.

5. That by erroneously fixing the boundary line of the reservation as running up Reservation Creek to its headwaters and from ther
in a straight line to Spencer Point, defendant has taken and does now
deprive petitioner of all the land described in next preceding paragraph hereof.

b. That, with the exception referred to in paragraph 5 hereof,
the boundary of the reservation as set forth in paragraph 3 of these
findings is the true and correct boundary of the reservation as described in and provided for in said treaty of June 9, l855.

7. Prior to 1904, it had been discovered that through an

erroneous survey made in l890 the Indians had been deprived of at

least 293,837 acres of their lands which had been excluded from their

reservation, and part of the lands in the excluded area had been disposed of by defendant to settlers and purchasers under the public land

laws. To meet this situation there was enacted the.Act of December 21,

1904, 33 Stat. 595, section 1 of which contained the following pro-xi

visions:

In passing it might be stated that a large part of the excluded area

to petitioners lying in the area between the summit of the Cascade

Mountains and the Spencer Point -- Hump (Goat Butte) line, and thereby

deprived petitioner of that much of its lands. (See Cl. Ex. 71).

9. In 1861 the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Washington
Territory made an agreement with Thomas F. Berry and James Lodge (Cl.
Ex. 1) to survey that portion of the boundary of the reservation from

"the ‘divide’ between the waters of the Klickitat and Pisco rivers" to

a point on the Yakima River, defined in the treaty as follows:

* * * thence along said divide to the divide
separating the waters of the Satass Creek from
those flowing into the Columbia River; thence
along said divide to the main Yakama, eight
miles below the mouth of the Satass River, * * *.

In making their survey, Berry and Lodge attempted to find a

point eight miles down the Yakima River below the mouth of Satus Creek

'("Satass River") and to proceed from that point by surveying in the

reverse direction from that of the description in the treaty.
10. The only survey that Berry and Lodge were to make was that

of the southern boundary from a point "on the Yakima River, where the
‘divide’ separating the waters of the Satus River from those flowing

into the Columbia River juts against said Yakima river," southerly

C and westerly until the "divide" between the Klickitat and Pisco Rivers

should be reached. However, the instruction given by the Superintendent

of Indian Affairs for Washington to Berry and Lodge stated that if the
intersection of the said "divide" with the Yakima River was not "plain
and apparent“ they should start at the "mouth of Satus River, and run

thence eight miles down the Yakima 1Eive§7 and from this point proceed

as previously directed." (Cl. Exs. 20 and 21, Def. Ex. 7).

The natural habit of minor tributaries entering a river through

i: a flood plain is to migrate downstream, not upstream. (Kidder, R. 566._i;_,33 566). The witness Calvin, apparently failed to take this fact into con; sideration.in formulating his theory regarding the location of the mouth

it was in Section 8 of T. 9 N., R. 22 E. (Def. Ex. l; Calvin, R. 181183) .

13. The first survey of the west or right bank of the Yakima‘

River under the direction of the General Land Office was made in 1874
by T. M. Reed under a contracttof June 27, 1874. This contract authorized a survey and subdivision of the part of T. 9 N., R. 22 E., lying
west of the Yakima River. This survey involved the meandering of a
portion of the west or right bank of the Yakima River.’ The field notes
of this survey, which are a part of the records of the General Land
Office, show that after Reed had determined the point where the eastern
boundary of T. 9 N., R. 22 E., interesected the Yakima River, he made a
meander survey of the west bank from the said intersection to the mouth
of Satus Creek, which he located near the center of Section 8 of the
said township, and found such meandered distance to be 994.70 chains

or l2.43 miles. ‘Reed had no instructions to ascertain a point eight
miles down the Yakima River and apparently made no effort to determine

the location of such a point. (Def. Exs. 1, 11, 12. 15; R. 183; 3863s7,s391-393).i
14. In 1885 Harry A. Clarke made a sectionalized survey of

T. 9 N}, R. 22 E., and also meandered the west or right bank of the
Yakima River, under instructions from the General Land Office. He
submitted complete field notes of the survey and also a plat of the
township.

Clarke found the mouth of Satus Creek just north of th

center of Section 8, T. 9 N., R. 22 E., at substantially the same

 survey of the southeastern and southern boundary of the reservation,

had for some time been considered the east boundary of the reservation

(or at least the whites had not settled west of it), he recommended

‘that the range line, which was 8 miles, 12.2 chains down the river

from the mouth of Satus Creek, be accepted as the starting point for
the southeastern and southern boundary. Clarke therefore began his
boundary survey at the corner of fractional sections 25 and 30 between
Ranges 22 and 23. ’(c1. Exs. 27-28; Def. Ex. 15; R. 363-364).

l6. From a point in the western part of T. 6 N., R. 16 E., there
is a divide that separates the waters flowing into Satus Creek, a
tributary of the Yakima River, from the waters flowing southward toward
the Columbia River which do not flow into the Yakima River. This divide
extends easterly to about the center of T. 7 N., R. 21 E., where this
ridge, known as Horse Heaven Hills, ceases to form the divide between
the Satus Creek and streams flowing southerly into the Columbia River.
From about the center of T. 7 N., R. 21 E., the main ridge extending
northeasterly becomes a divide between waters that flow northerly
into the Yakima Riner east of the Satus Creek watershed and the waters
flowing in a southerly direction to the Columbia River. The trainage
of the major portions of T. 8 N., R. 22 E., is into the Yakima River
east of the watershed of Satus Creek. Only a small portion of the
southwestern quarter of T. 9 N., R. 22 E., and a small area in the
northwestern part of T. 8 N., R. 22 E., lie within the Satus watershed.

from the intersection of the line between ranges 22 and 23 and the

Yakima River and thence southwesterly to a point near the center of
