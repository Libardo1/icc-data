0'1-IARR, Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Comission.

The claims hereafter referred to have been presented by the Saginaw; h..'."._' Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan and one James Strong, a member of 1'-he

 plaintiff tribe. This plaintiff tribe consists of the Saginaw Tribe
and portions of the Swan Creek and Black River Bands of Chippewa Indians.
The identity of the claimants and their right to maintain the claims is

Prior to the treaty of 1855, which will hereafter be referred to,

t5“§the plaintiff tribes were interested in certain.Michigan lands and had

f*l=hmI§rights in annuities growing out of various treaties with the Chippewa

.':Nation of Indians, or the separate plaintiff bands. No further reference

‘ :\to these rights will be made since they are not involved here and have no

Iifthey had_to such lands or annuities were duly relinquished by Article 3

.. __!

*}p:7%of said treaty of 1855, and formed part of the consideration for the


‘__;';-ii rights acquired under that treaty.

By the treaty of August 2, l8S5, (ll Stat. 633), the United States

did}? agreed with the Saginaw to withdraw from sale, for the benefit of said

_;5dy§Indians, all the unsold public lands within the State of Michigan, em.—

lands therein comprised 60,873.23 acres, which were made available for
selection or entry by said Indians (Finding 2). This area lies about
25 or 30 miles east of the Isabella Reservation, and became known as
the Saginaw Reservation. Said area is also described in Finding 2
hereof.

After the 1855 treaty became effective, members of the Saginaw— ~
made selections in both reservations, which they were, under the treaty,
permitted to do, and according to the record herein, all of the unsold
lands located within the Isabella Reservation were eventually selected
by the members of the Saginaw to the extent of 98,051.13 acres, but it
is not definitely shown the number of acres selected by the Saginaw in
the Saginaw Reservation. By the treaty of l855, the members of the
Saginaw were given the right to select lands within either of said reservations for a period of five years after the time of the completion of
the lists of persons eligible for selection thereof, and the members of
the Saginaw were also given the exclusive right to enter’(purchase) upon
the lands Eb withdrawn and unsold for a period of five years after the
!time limited for selection. The.rules and regulations governing such
selection are set forth in Finding 3, which fixes the amounts of land
that could be selected by the individual Indians. These amounts vary
according to marital status, age, etc., of the Indians.

FIRST CLAIM

For its first claim.the Saginaw alleges that the Indians were

deprived of their lands in the Saginaw Reservation through fraud perpetrated upon them by the defendant, and for an unconscionable consideration, in.the consummation of the treaty between the Saginaw and the

-.. s€;§plain facts, for an examination of the treaty whihh is set forth in Finding

~  ' '--? '

initheir lands in the Saginaw Reservation, reserved to them by the treaty of
V,,fl855, and, specifically, their rights to the selections they had already

Isabella Reservation had been selected by members of the Saginaw -“.
pursuant to the 1864 treaty. So the Saginaw did receive valuable
rights which it and its members did not enjoy prior to the l864 treaty,
and in addition to that, the government expended, as required by the
latter treaty, $20,000 for educational purposes.

We have mentioned that under the 1855 treaty, the Saginaw acquired
60,873.23 acres in the Saginaw Reservation. This acreage figure is based
upon Defendant's Exhibit 1, which shows that after the 1855 treaty, the
government sold 43,025.82 acres (PP. 3-16, inclusive), to which has been
added 17,567.41 acres of lands in the Saginaw Reservation granted to
railroads under the Act of June 3, 1856, (ll Stat. 21), this grant having
deprived the Indians of that amount of land within the Saginaw Reservation

which they had acquired by the 1855 treaty. ‘Taking the total acreage,

‘therefore, and deducting therefrom 280 acres, which the Saginaw retained

in the Saginaw'Reservation under the treaty of 1864, it would appear that
the Saginaw relinquished 60,593.23 acres by the latter treaty.
The government's defense to this clahn, as set forth in its answer
and brief, is that the Saginaw, as such, obtained no title by the 1855
treaty to the lands located in the Saginaw Reservation, in that by the
provisions of that treaty it was only the individual members of the
Saginaw whé derived any benefit to lands under the treaty, and hence,
the tribe, as such, had no clahm it, as a tribe, could assert.
‘ It is difficult for us to see the force of this reasoning, for the
government dealt with the Indians as a group, represented by chiefs and
headmen of the tribe, in'consummating the treaty of l855 and again in

concluding the treaty of 1864. ,At no time did it deal, or attempt to

deal, with the individual members of the Saginaw. Whatever rights

the individual Indians acquired in the two reservations stem from

the two treaties which were brought about by tribal, not individual,
action.

Before discussing the legal or equitable principles involved, it

may be pointed out that the defendant in all its transactions with the
Saginaw treated that group as an entity. In the very first paragraph

of the 1855 treaty it is recited, "In view of the existing condition

of the Indians aforesaid, ***" and in the first paragraph of Article 1

P'@ defendant promised to withdraw from sale for "the benefit of said Indians,"

Obviously,

the lands they received in the Isabella and Saginaw reservations.

* in both of these instances the treaty refers to the entity named in the open5

ing clause of the treaty, namely, the "Chippewa Indians of Saginaw" and a
portion of the "band of Chippewa Indians of Swan Creek and Black River,"

the Indian parties to the treaty. Later, and in concluding the 1864 treaty,
it again dealt with the same entity in obtaining a relinquishment of the
Saginaw reservation lands. And, it will be noted, that in the first paragraph of Article 1 of said treaty, October 18, l864 (14 Stat. 657), said

entity, the Saginaw, released "the several townships of land reserved to

said tribe by said treaty aforesaid," referring to the treaty of August 2,

1855, and by the second paragraph of the same article there was relinquished

the "right to purchase the unselected lands in said reservation," meaning,

several other places in the treaty. While the use of-the word does not

itself indicate title, it is not withou:significance when used in connection with a relinquishment of valuable rights in land set aside for

the Indian use. Whether it acquired title in the accepted meaning of
that term is not important if the Saginaw acquired, as it did, sufficient
interest in the lands to compel a compliance by defendant of its obligations with respect thereto. Ihat.the Saginaw had such an interest was
recognized and confirmed by later acts of the defendant hereafter referred
to.

Nor does the fact that the 1855 treaty provided for individual allotments militate against tribal interest because that very interest or
title or right, whatever it may be called, was a protection of individual
rights in that it insured that individual members could makevselections

. A,
or entries on the lands withdrawn for their occupancy.

Furthermore, if the Saginaw, as such, had any rights in the Saginaw
Reservation they were acquired under the l855.treaty; if the Saginaw
acquired no such rights under that treaty, as defendant claims, it parted
with none by the 1864 treaty. But it is evident that both the Government
and the Saginaw thought the latter had rights in the Saginaw Reservation
that could only be eliminated by a solemn treaty-which sould cancel the
tribal rights and also the rights of the individual members who had made
selections therein, otherwise no treaty with the tribal entity would
have been effective or necessary. It appears contrary to the previous
position of defendant to now contend that this same entity it had previously recognized and dealt with as owner of the land cannot prosecute a
claim based upon a grossly inadequate consideration for the rights relinquished by that treaty.

But whatever tribal rights the Saginaw, as such, acquired in the

Isabella Reservation by the 1855 treaty are only incidental to the

-    ' 2 397

  question before us because the claim here presented arose out of the

at §'
.

 1864 treaty and by that treaty, as before noted, the Saginaw, as such,

 by Article 1, (1) released to the "United States the several townships
 of land reserved to said tribe by the treaty aforesaid (l855), situate
 _._ :
 and being upon Saginaw Bay * * *," and (2), the Saginaw, as such, re linquished their "right to purchase the unselected lands in said reser vation" (Isabella), as provided in the 1855 treaty. (As to the re  linquishment of the claimed right to "locate lands in lieu of lands sold
 or disposed of" in Isabella Reservation, see Defendant's Ex. 17, p. 451).
 As consideration for the above relinquishments -- and Article 2 of
1_. the 1864 treaty expressly soprovides, (see Finding -S) -- the Saginaw,
A  as such, was granted the "exclusive use, ownership and occupancy * * * of
 all the unsold lands within the six townships in Isabella County reserved
 -  to said Indians by the treaty of August 2, l855 * * *." Language plainer
 h  than this is difficult to find as showing the vesting of title to Isabella
  lands in the Saginaw. True, as provided by Article 3 of the treaty, indiA  vidual Indians were given the right of making -selections in Isabella but

 until they did so, and probably until they obtained patents, tribal title

for the relinquishment of the Saginaw Reservation lands was the “exclusive
use, ownership and occupancy" of all the Isabella Reservation lands. That
is what the Saginaw got for what they relinquished. Accordingly, we must
know the value of this consideration as well as the value of what the
Saginaw relinquished if we are to determine whether the consideration was
unconscionable.

As before stated, there being no proof of fraud, the question raised
by the pleadings and remaining to be determined is whether the Saginaw
received an unconscionable consideration for the lands they relinquished
in the Saginaw'Reservation by the 1864 treaty. It is plaintiffs‘ theory,
as shown.by their petition, that they relinquished that acreage and received nothing for it and as proof of damage sustained relies upon the
price obtained by defendant when part of the lands were sold by it. This.
price, as plaintiffs state in their brief, "is the best evidence of its
value" and is obtained from Defendant's Ex. 1, pp. 3-16.

The exhibit shows that beginning in 1855 and ending in 1874 the defendant made sales in small tracts totaling 43,025.82 acres of the Saginaw
Reservation land for the aggregate sum of $96,580.55. These sales accounted
for all the Indian land in the Saginaw Reservation, except the 17,567.41
acres granted the railroads, but as to this no proof has been offered.

Nor have plaintiffs or defendant offered any evidence whatever as to
the value of what plaintiffs received as consideration for the relinquishment of the Saginaw Reservation lands. In their petition plaintiffs plead
that under the 1864 treaty they obtained rights in Isabella, but allege

in effect that such rights were those they already had under the 1855

treaty. We have already pointed out that as a result of the l864 treaty

 

.. ::"°..-_..    «' 2 399

_A    the Saginaw were given the exclusive use, ownership and occupancy of all

 Q  the unsold lands in Isabella Reservation, which included the right of

.. '7 _-'~ ;_‘—:~,.--- ;g_ ‘L  --.3
 selection by individual members thereof, a right which had expired l_ong
 prior to that treaty._ These rights had value beyond doubt, but until

  proof of such value ‘is offered we are unable to determine whether the

   consideration was unconscionable.

    In view of the above,',- and in justice to the Indians we are of the

_  opinion that the plaintiffs are authorized to assert the claim setforth

    in their petition as First Claim .and that the case must be reopened to

‘H  5 : ‘.  permit proof of value, as indicated above.
 I E   snconm CLAIM
- - This claim is for loss of timber taken from the Isabella Reservation
g. resulting, it is alleged, from the failure of defendant to issue allot‘..._  H  ment certificates and patents to the Indians, to protect th in their

 _,;   tribal rights, perform its duties as guardian and fulfill its obligations

  - -  under the 1855 treaty. I l

:_  7  The proof offered and mainly relied upon by plaintiffs is based upon_

F a report (Pl. Ex. 2.) prepared on february 21, 1935, by the Assistant Secre ‘  tary of the Interior. This prooftonsists of reports of Indian agents
  -. .p  indicating the removal of timber from the reservation but is so lacking
:'*' '_''.-*'Qi
__    in definiteness as to time, place and value of the timber alleged to have

   been taken it cannot be accepted as a basis of liability. It shows, perhaps,
—‘_t  that the timber was taken in part from lands occupied by Indians who had made
 selections and who dealt with timbermen for the removal thereof, and it shows
If    that part: was taken from trtibal lands. No attempt -was made to separate thr

places from which timber was removed. The evidence also shows that a
large part was removed by the Indians themselves through connivance with
timber operators. Also that the Indian agents tried in many ways to
protect the Indians but to no avail.

No proof has been offered showing that the loss of the timber was
due to the delay of defendant to issuegallotment certificaunior patents
to the Indian selectees or that the defendant-was obligated in any way
to do more than it did in protecting them from timber removals. The evidence offered is so vague and indefinite that a finding of liability
would have to be based upon.mere conjecture. We, therefore, see no basis

for believing any better proof could be presented at another hearing, so
‘we dismiss this claim as unproven.

FOURTH CLAIM

The fourth claim inwolves the selecting and patenting of 29,430.84
acres of swamp lands to the State of Michigan under the Act of September 28
1850, (9 Stat. 519), generally referred to as the Swamp Land Act. Lands
aggregating the above acreage were selected in the areas of the Isabella
and Saginaw Reservations and patented to the State of Michigan.

_As we understand the allegations of the petition, the plaintiffs are
claiming that part, about 15,000 acres, of the 29,430.84 acres were classified as swamp lands when in fact they were timber lands and because of such
wrongful classification the Saginaw was deprived of at least 15,000 acres
in the two reservations. In their briefs, however, plaintiffs present an
entirely different theory of liability which in some respects is in conflict with the allegations of their petition.’ They contend, (1) that all

the 29,430.84 acres patented to Michigan were wrongfully classified as

- --u-—u-u-_.-.-n. .. - —-—-.o
\.....-n-— ,

--1h &.JA i- - -Z-—-—-i;t1o-h- - " - ---- - '1-swamp lands, and (2) in any event the swamp lands of the two reservations
did not come within the definition of "unsold public lands" set aside by
the l855 treaty. Rather than limiting our inquiry to the claim.plainly

pleaded we shall consider both aspects of the claim asserted by plaintiffs

in their briefs.

In the first place, plaintiffs have offered no proof that any of the
swamp lands were wrongfully classified as such. .A few Indian witnesses
testified about "wet lands“ within the reservations which were covered
with timber but such testimony is of little value because it was very
general in character and in no place was it shown that any specific land
patented to Michigan was wrongfully classified as swamp land. (Pltf. Ex. 1).
Opposed to such testimony the defendant offered much documentary evidence
indicating all lands selected as swamp lands were properly classified as

such and patents issued therefor. We find no proof indicating, even re; motely, that any—specific part of the lands patented by the State of.

Michigan were wrongfully classified as swamp lands. Not only that, but
under the Swamp Land Act the classification of such lands by the Government
officials charged with the duty of designating them.is conclusive and may
not now, nearly a century later, be questioned. See Wright v. Roseberry,
121 U. S. 488, Chandler v. Calumet, 149 U. S. 79.

As to the other contention of plaintiffs they seem.to concede that
the swamp lands within the two reservations passed to the State of
Michigan as of September 28, l850, the date of the Swamp Land.Act (p. 13
of Reply Brief), but say such lands must be included within the category

of "unsold public lands” which were by the treaty of 1855 set aside for

the benefit of the Saginaw. The undisputed evidence (Def. Ex. 30) shows

the Indians were well aware of the fact that swamp lands did not pass

to the Indians under the 1855 treaty, and at no time claimed they did
until the present claim was filed. On December 3, 1855 (Def, Ex. 30)
they asked for two additional townships of land.and two fractional
townships in addition to the two townships originally provided for in

the treaty, and in accordance with the Saginaw request the Senate amended
the treaty and gave them the unsold public lands in the four full and two
fractional townships described in the treaty. (Def. Ex. 30). Had the
‘Indians believed they were entitled to the swamp lands their request of
December 3, 1856, and the approval of the Indian Agent would have so
indicated, but, as we have said, those documents plainly indicate that
they recognized the fact that the swamp lands were not intended to be
available for Indian use under the treaty.

Furthermore, the evidence offered of the surrounding circumstances
which brought about the treaty of l855 plainly shows that the parties to
that treaty understood that in using the phrase "unsold public lands"'
within the area of the Isabella and Saginaw Reservations that it did not

:include the swamp lands previously selected therein, in fact, the request
for additional lands in.the Saginaw Bay area was based upon the understanding-of all parties to the 1855 treaty that the Indians were not to
receive the swamp lands. ‘

From the above, it necessarily follows that the second and fourth

claims must be-disallowed, and the first claim.reopened for the purpose
