filed May 8, 1978, by Robert S. Johnson, attorney of record for the
plaintiffs in Docket 15—C, together with the vouchers and other documentation accompanying said petition, and the contract under which the
claims in said Docket 15—C were prosecuted, the Commission finds as

follows:

appropriated under section 1302 of the Supplemental Appropriation Act,
1957, 31 U.S.C. §724a, as amended by Title II, section 201, of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1978 (92 Stat. 107, 116-117).

5. Response of the Parties. No response was received from the
tribal representatives. The Department of Justice takes no position on
the allowance of attorney expenses in this docket, as indicated in its
letter of July 5, 1978. Enclosed with the letter of the Department of
Justice was a letter dated June 22, 1978, from the Acting Associate
Solicitor, Division of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, and
a memorandum dated June 19, 1978, from the Assistant Secretary, Bureau
of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior. The June 19 memorandum
states that most items claied in the petition for reimbursement appear
to be reasonable and fall generally into categories proper for reimbursemnt,
excepting ten items listed in the memorandum by date of voucher.

6. Petition Adjustments. Upon examination of the petition and the
documents filed in support thereof, the memorandum submitted by the
Department of the Interior, and the records of the Comission, the Com-_

mission determines the following:

(1) Washington l5—C et al. Political Entity Hearing,
expenses during trip, voucher dated 1/20/64 indicates

$293.75 as the total, but a $6.60 arithmetic error was

noted. The Commission has included $300.35 as the
correct figure in its total of awarded expenses.

(2) Milwaukee Public Museum, voucher dated 2/4/64,

$4.10 for the book, Social Organization of the Central
Algonkian Indians. There was no indication of the

in Docket 15-C, as noted by the Departmnt of the
Interior memorandum. The Comission has deleted $4.10

from its total of awarded expenses.

(4) Statement of Jack Joseph, voucher dated 6/20/74,
totaling $710.64. This includes $16.45 for photostats

included $694.19 as the corrected figure in its total

of awarded expenses.

(5) Statement of Jack Joseph, voucher dated 3/7/75,

claims $117.11. But since $76.92 was incurred for Dockets
15-L and 216, and $20.70 was incurred for Dockets 15—K
and l5—M, the Department of the Interior recommends that
this sum be disallowed. The Commission agrees and has
deleted $97.62 from its total of awarded expenses.

conference, voucher dated 12/1/76, $316.83. The Department of the Interior has called our attention to the

the requirement that no portion of this expense may be
claimed for reimbursement under other docket numbers.
