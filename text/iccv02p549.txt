The two claimants set forth in the title separately submitted claims

‘Q

on behalf of the Delaware Tribe or Nation of Indians against the baited
tates §’rc5_‘-o'1‘l'1e value of a strip of land ten miles wide extending across
the northerly part of the State of Kansas from a point or line lying
about 45 or 50 miles west of theIMissouri river. (See Royce's Indian
Cessions, Kansas 2, tract 316). This strip of land is referred to in
the treaties, hereafter to be considered, and by the parties to this
ontroversy, as the "outlet" and was intended as a corridor to give the
Delawares access from their lands lying in eastern Kansas between the
Missouri and Kansas rivers to the hunting areas lying to the west.

Both claimants seek recovery for the value of the "outlet," those in
Docket No. 27-A placing the western boundary at a distance of about

150 miles west of the starting line while the claimants in Docket No.
2&1 would fix the west boundary a distance of some 340 miles west of
the starting line, but whatever the leacth of the "outlet" was both
claimants are asking for the value of it.

There is not a great deal of controversy over the facts. The

real issue is as to the character of title to the outlet the Delawares
obtained by the treaty of September 24, 1829, 7 Stat. 327. The claim?
ants insist that they required fall Indian title to the outlet, while

-I
..

tne defendant contends they, the Delawares, acquired a mere easement
or rignt of way from Eteir lands lying to the east of the outlet,
between the fsrks of the Missouri and Kansas rivers, to the hunting
'r“nnds to tie west and, being of nominal value, it passed by the

t__,'
C}

oession.thereof by the treaty of May 6, 1854, 10 Stat. 1048. The

-. .-u.-n.o.a

4-.

ergument of counsel on both sides is mainly devoted to the question or
title acquired by the l829 treaty. Although fraud on the part of
defendant is pleaded in Docket No. 27-A, the feature of the claim is
not pressed.

Before discussing the character of the Indian rights in the outlet
it will be helpful to consider the land area described in the 1829
treaty. It will be seen (Find. 3) that tee area falls into two sections,
roughly, the east section and west section. The east section is first
located as ”nhat ** country in tn fork of the Kansas and Missouri
rivers.“ In delimiting the boundaries of this area the treaty descrip”extending np the Kansas river to the

<n fixes the southerly line as
Kan as line," that is, the Kansas Indian Reservation east line at a
point =here it crossed the Kan-r. river. Ehe other line of the east
division started at the confluence of the two rivers, also, and ran
“up the Missouri river to Camp Leavenworth and thence by a line drawn
westwardly, leaving a space ten miles wide nortn of the Kansas
!Reservatiqn7 boundary line for an outlet." Thus we find that the east
division was limited on the west by that art of the east line of Lne
Kansas Reservation extending north from the *nsas river to the northeast corner thereof, and thence n rte to meet the "westwardly" line
from Camp Leavenworth and thns'provide the space ten miles wide rennin
along the north boundary of the Kansas Reservation. ?he west boundary
of the east division would necessarily be the line extending north of
the northeast corn r of ti Kansas Reservation tooa point ten miles

north of the corner. (See Def. En. 46(a}). This area has been generally referred to as the Delaware “residence lands" and was Ee area

they lived on. This area is not involved in this proceeding,«—t;e
west section of the ceded area, of course, being the “outlet,” which

ran west along the north boundary of the Kansas Reservation as it

('0
I

zisted in 1829 from the north-south line mentioned above. ?here is

ino evidence that the Delaware had any permanent settlements wittinithe

outlet, that is, west of the north-south line mentioned above.

ADMESSIBILITY OF DEFENDANT'S EXHIBET No. 62

 

At a.hearing on the above claims the-defendant offered in evidence
as Defendant's Exhibit No. 62 (Trans. pp. 264-272) a petition in a case
brought in the Court of Claims by "the Delaware Indians, residing in
and being a band of the Cherokee Tribe or Nation” (Findings 11 and 12)

to recover the difference in value between the lands in Indians ceded

or

by tne Delaware by the treaty of October 3, l8l8, 7 Stat. 188, and the
Kansas lands they received under the supplemental treaty ff September 24,
1829, 7 Stat. 327. In the petition in that case, which was verified by
a.member of and attorney-in-fact for the claimant group, it was alleged
in respect to the outlet, h re involved, "That the outlet referred to

in said treaty of September 24, 1829, was found to_contain about 1,000,000

1

acres, but that said Delawares were not the owners thereof, and merely

had an easement or right of way therein, and that subsequently the rights

1''‘
._n

or said Delawares in said outlet were purchased by the defendant under
a certain treaty of May 6, 1854 (10 Stat. 1048), for the sum of $10,000
only, and at_the time of the negotiation of said treaty of September 24,

1829, the value of tte rigtts in said outlet granted to said Delawares

.3

did not exceed the sum of $5,000." Both petitioners objccxoo to the

4-’.5.

introduction the exhibit and the ruling thereon was reserved.

We believe the document is admissible in evidence for the reasons

hereinafter stated.

_I

It

is provided by Sec. 14 of the Indian Claim; Commission Act that,

”* *aay official letter, paper, document, map, or
record in the possession of any afficer, or court of
the Snited States ** (or certified copy thereof), may
be used in evidence insofar as relevant and material,
5': -:'c_''

It
I"

“E Lee relevancy and materiality of the

rnere can be no serious doubt about
evidence. The Indian rights to the outlet were made an issue of fact,
by the above-quoted a legations of the petition and served as the

Indians’ interpretation of the meanins of the cession as respects tie

rights granted by tn treaty, a perfectly legitimate assertion in view
of the ambiguous laaetage used in tie treaty. Here, as tn pleadings

aed contentions of the petitioners show, the Delawares have taken an

entirely contrary position as to tt title or rights they acquired in

the outlet.
That the proffered evidence is admissible is amply-supported by the

following authorities:

Pope v. Allis, 115 U.S. 363; Cady v. Doxtator

{Mict.) 139 N.W. l5l; Kunglig etc. v. Dexter, 32 Fed. 2d, 195; 20 Am.

ttorneys in Docket No. 241 say that even though the evidence,

B‘E$n%JEt!3 Ex. 62, may be admissible as against the petitioners in
Eecket No. 27uA it is not admissible against the Absentee Delawares

‘guru(Docket No. 241), for the reason, apparently, that that gr op was not

2 553

-._.........o-u-.uw-ac-u---vim

2 554
a party to the former case. Even though the title of the case was not
technically in the name of the Delaware Nation or_Tribe, the all; atioaa

of the petition show that a claim was asserted for the Delaware Tribe

{Binding 12, par. 3(d)) and, as we have already decided, the Absentee
Delaware are members of that tribe and wodld be entitled to share it a

recovery as members of that tribe (2 Ind. Claims Com. 253-71) sh’~‘ c“

"_-t 7'," 'esard be made. The Absentee Delawares are not claiming rights personal

to that group but are seeking the enforcement of the rights of the
laware N tion or Tribe growing out of the l8l8 and 1829 treaties, as
is the petitioner in Dochet°27-A. The plaintiffs in the former case
“e-e, likewise, asserting rights of the Delaware Tribe based upon the

Sc3.'.T;C:‘.

treaties and in that case, as in the claim now before us, the title

ei interest of the Tribe in.the outlet was made an issue by the allegations quoted above. The relationship of the former action to the claim
here asserted by the Absentee Delawares is too-plain for doubt. Where
such privity of interest appears admissions such as are shown in the
eigibit are admissible as evidence,'a1though not conclusive. 4 Wigmore

, sections 1076 and 1080.

INTEREST OF DELAWARES IN OUTLET

 

The decisive question to be resolved in this case is the interest
acquired by the Delawares under the 1829 treaty in the outlet, that is,

lather the Indians received full Indian title to the same or merely

rota petitioners stress thoosignifioance of a single granting clause

but ne the: cites any cases or law on the proposition. Defendant in its

Q’

brief, mentions the matter but refers only to the surrounding circumstances. We, therefore, can see nothing controlling in the feet that
-2-‘-nere is one granting clause. It cannot be said that a sin le granting

clause would pass full Indian title to the outlet if the intention of
the parties were otherwise. The fact of a single granting clause should
or course be considered in the total picture in-determining the intent
of the parties. Whatever weight is given to this fact must be on the
side of the petitioners in their claim of full Indi n title, just as

less than full Indian title, the words of grant ‘n this case are clearly
sufficient to convey fell Indian title to the lands described in the
treaty article. It csn likewise be said that the words of grant are
sufficient to meet the requirement that an easement can only be created
by grant or by prescription which implies grant if we sh uld find that
only an easement in th "Oat et" was created.

‘"33 a permanent residence." In petitioner’s reply brief, Dkt. 27-A

-_-5 '...-v-. {there is a brief reference to the meaning of the words "as a permahehresidence." By the u eel rules of grammar, these words would refer to
i

the entire description including the ”Gntlet." Petitioner in Docket

2?«A.also observes that "It is common knowledge that all the land included
in an Zndian reservation is the home or tribal residence of the parties:
tribe." However, if we begin to look at facts and circumst noes outside

‘I

of the actual words themselves, as will be discussed later, there is considerable evidence that only that portion of the grant other than the
"Gatlet" was considered "Residence Lands."

In considering the entire wording of the gr nting instrument, we
can also consider the effect of the pledge "to guarantee to the said
Delaware Nation forever, the quiet and peaceful possession an un—
disturbed enjoyment of the same, against the claims and assaults of all
and every other people whatever.” These words are equally appropriate
whether the title to the-whole is Indian title or whether the title to
the “Outlet” is only an easement.

The important words to consider are: "leaving a space ten miles
wide, north of the Kansas boundary line, for an ttlet." it should
first be noted that while all of the descript‘ve words are together in
the treaty, the words "leaving a space ten miles wide, eorth of the
Kansas b "rdary line, for W oat et" ms t be-segarated from the descriphtah CDC

tion because {he wards "for an outlet" apyly only to the space ten miles

9 -.10“

be adm tted by petitioners bec use they do n t ciaim that the words “got

2 558

an outlet" apply to the entire described area.

?etitioner in Docket 241 contends that any attempt to draw ; Line
between the residence lands and the outlet is a tortured and unnatural
construction of the language. They say: "The line from the Northeast
corner %f the Kansas Reservation to a point ten miles to the north of
it, which defendant attempts to draw, is not drawn by the Supplementary
artiste.” it is true that the description does not set out such a line
by mates and bounds. However, it is likewise true that there is only
one place where a dividing line could be drawn and that is a line from
the Northeast corner of the Kansas Reservation to a point ten miles to
the north of it. it is considerably easier to fix such an eastern
boundary of the outlet than to fix a western boundary, there being a
dispute between the petitioners as to the location of the western
boundary. There has been no contention by either petitioner or the
defendant that the descriptive words in the treaty are not sufficient
to identify the land which was the object of the grant. Yet the descriptive words did not in themselves describe by metes and bounds the
exact location of the boundary line at Camp Leavenworth and from there
"westwardly" to the beginning of the outlet. It was necessary for the

surveyor, who was authorized by the resolution of the United States

Senate, dated May 29, l83O (Def. Ex. 43} to run the lines, to make

.certain adjustments in running those lines in general conformity with

'1

CL; descriptive words of the treaty. And so we repeat that it is a

(1!

simple process to run an exact line between the ten-mile wide outlet

Deleweres a tenumile strip over which they could pass to the hunting
grounds to the West. Since they he; no way of t turning other than
over this same strip, the word “outlet” includes the intent or put»
pomiof also moving back from the hunting gtounes to their residence

meaning and effect when used in deeds of conveyance. Petitioners’

brief,
Docket 241, states: "Where the deed of conveyance uses the term ‘right
of way‘, it has been generally recognized that merely an easement passes"
and cites Richfield Oil Corp. v. Chesapeake & C. B. R. Co., 179 Md. 560,
20A 2d 581 (1941); Gulf Coast Water Co. v. Hamman Exploration Company
(Tex. Civ. App.) 160 S. W. 2d 92 (1942). Defendant's brief states:
"Where the instrument of conveyance uses the term ‘right-of—way' or some
similar phrase, it has been generally recognized than an easement passes,"
and cites the same two cases. There is no showing, on the other hand,
that the word "outlet" has such a general and common meaning in conveyances that its meaning and effect upon the estate granted would be
definite, uniform and established. Actually the word "outlet" is not a
commonly used word in instruments of conveyance and in order to establish
its meaning and effect when used in an instrument of conveyance, it is
often, if not generally necessary to look to other evidence to establish
its meaning and effect as intended by the parties involved.

It is now necessary to consider the additional question involving
the wording of the instrument of grant presented by the petitioners‘ contention that the 1929 treaty on its face conveyed full Indian title because
"the term ‘outlet’ merely describes the purpose to which the land was
expected to be put and does not by itself operate to reduce the nature

” In support of this proposition

of the grant to that of an easement.
counsel have cited a number of cases whichrwe have examined but have not

found them helpful because they deal with situations not, as we think,

comparable to the conveyance here under consideration, which is unlike

the terms of any of the conveyances passed on by any of the courts in
the cited cases, We believe that in order to ascertain the intention
of the parties it is necessary to consider all relevant evidence relating to tie transaction.

SURROUNDING CIRC3MS?ANCES

 

4-1», ..-.4..
1..;-c.3.L.All parties hereto have agreed after considering the terms of

tie instrument on its face, if doubt exists as to tne intent of the
parties, it is necessary and proper to look to the surroun‘ing circumstances. The case of Wise et al., v. Watts et al., 239 F. 207, states

the rule well as follows: "It almost goes without saying that the paramount object in the construction of a deed is to give effect to the in-11 "'5'?-..

tention of the parties to it. rities to that effect

might readily

be cited by the hundreds, but it is needless to consume space for that

pu;pose. Such intention, of course, is to be gathered from a considerthe entire instrument read in the light of the facts and circumstances under which it was executed."

First, we shall discuss the contention of the defendcnt that “by

Li

4-1.1829, -“e granting of outlets to the several tribes had become common

practice" and that Etta evidence indicates that the provision in the

Supplementary Ereaty of September 24, 1829, assigning an outlet to the

Delawares had a clear and definite meaning to the Zndians and the

Government alike.” (It has already been noted above that the word

number of places in defendant's brief where it refers to this "common
practice." The defendant first cites Defendant's Exhibit 42, which is
a letter from Isaac McCoy, a surveyor who later made the official survey
of the Delaware lands under the 1829 treaty, to the Hon. P. B. Porter,

Secretary of Way, dated January 29, 1829. The letter states (pp. 20-21

of Exhibit):

"The superabundance of the several claims, and the
clashing of claims, are not the only defects of this
character in the present system of operation. I sup-.
pose that the circumstances of giving to each tribe an
outlet, so called, is entirely superfluous, and calculated to lead to perplexing difficulties. By outlet,

is understood a slip of land extending from that more
particularly stipulated in the treaty as being designated for settlement, west, into the uninhabitable regions
of the desert and the mountains. The Choctaw outlet is
about one hundred miles wide. The width of that of the
Creeks is not yet settled, on account of the clashing

of their claims with those of the Cherokees. That which
belongs to both is about one hundred and twenty miles
wide. The Osage outlet is fifty miles, and that of the
Kansas thirty miles wide. The object of these outlets
is, that each may have access to hunting land in the
west. But why not make those uninhabitable regions a
common hunting ground for all? The several hunting
parties will not be able to distinguish the particular
slip of land allowed for hunting purposes to the tribe
to which the party belongs; and even if they could, the
hunter, nevertheless, will roam wherever the game is to
be found. If metes and bounds be fixed to those hunting
lands, trespasses will inevitably be frequent, and may
lead to unpleasant consequences."

Isaac McCoy also discussed outlets in his report to the Secretary

of War of April 1831, concerning his survey of the Delaware lands (Pet.

Ex. 109) as follows:

"I respectfully ask leave to solicit attention to the
circumstances of giving to the several tribes an outlet.
However it may, at first blush, appear to our imaginations
when at a distance, I am persuaded that few could believe in

Ix)

tteir utility who would follow the lines of one of ttem
through a vast uninhabited region. Permission to go back

to the common hunting rronnds toward the mountains will

be desirable to all the tribes. But they could not possibly
conceive any advantage which they could derive from the
marking of a road for teem, say 10 or 20 miles wide. Not
the slightest regard would ever be paid by them to such
landmarks in their passing to and from their hunting
grounds. It is not a narrow strip of land alongside of
Arkansas Territory and the State of Missouri that we

may have under consideration, where tribes may be

located as on so many town lots facins eastward and

running back. The case will doubtless require that in

some places two or three tribes be located on the same

line of latitude. Nor can I conceive of any reason why
they should not."

1

Two things are clear in these exaibits, that McCoy uses the term

outlet to indicate the portion of the lands of tee various tribes which

gave teem "access to hunting lands in the west? and that he did not

believe in their "utility." One cannot reason that his use of the word

"outlet" carries with it any further implications as to similarity in

9

meaning ween used in reference to the Choctaw, Creeks, Cherokees, Osage

and Kansas. In fact, defendant points out that "While McCoy in one of

his letters ... referred to the grants to the Choctaws, Creeks, Osages,
Kaws and Cherokees as outlets, hese tracts, with the exception of ti

Cherokee grant, were.in reality the lands reserved by the said tribes

from tzeir cessions to the United States (Osages in 1825, 7 Stat. 240,
and Kaws in 1825, 7 Stat. 244), or the actual reservations granted the
tribes for their homes (Choctaws in 1820, 7 Stat. 210, and Creeks in

1825, 7 Stat. 237),‘a.nd ts.

treaties made no mention of outlets as such.

Only tie grant to the Cherokees in 1828 (? Stat. 311) involved an out»

let in the strict sense of the term. Moreover, the shape of the Delaware

"atlet, being a slip of land ‘running as it does such a length but little

K.-J

2 564

width‘ (Pet. Ex. ll6) in comparison with these other grants indicated

it was intended principally ‘as a road leading to the hunting land‘

rather than the hunting ground itself. The outlets assigned the Cherokees
and the Delawares fit McCoy’s definition of an outlet accurately, while
the reservations of the other tribes referred to and not designated as
outlets in tae treaties, were outlets only in the sense that they extended westward from the principal settlements of the tribes; they included, however, the hunting lands of the tribes as well as their homes

on the eastern end."

So as to the Choctaw, Creek, Osage and Kansas outlets described
by McCoy, the differences between these grants and that to the Delawares
are clear. The term "outlet" is not used in the treaties nor is any
other term used to designate an "outlet" apart from their residence
leads. The Delaware grant is also different in that a long narrow
strip is involved which is considerably less in width than the residence lands from which it extends.

Now let us turn our atte::*sn to the Cherokee "outlet" for consideration and any helpful comparison. All parties have treated the‘matterd
at length. This outlet was involved in the case of the Cherokee Nation v.
The Enited tates, 2 Indian Claims Commission 7, affirmed by the Court
of Claims, 124 C. Cls. l27, decided January 13, 1953. A reading of this
case shows that the term “outlet” was not only used in several Cherokee
treaties but that it appears in.many communications and negotiations
between government officials and the Cherokees over a period of many
years from 1817 on. t is th refore important to examine the case in

ever statements that were made in the negotiations of the 1817 treaty

can be construed as a definite promise of an outlet to the west as far

as the sovereignty of the soil extended, it would seem that said promise
has been more than complied with. The outlet provided by the 1828 treaty

extended to the 100th meridian....and was accepted at the time as a compliance with whatever agreement there was, as far as the record shows.F

(pp. 29, 30). The Commission further states:

"Considering the fact that under the promise of an

outlet the Cherokees were to ‘acquire no rights to the
soil, but merely and outlet;, and the fact that by the
treaty of 1828, and the patent of 1838, the Cherokees

did receive a ‘right to the soil; to 8,144,682.91 acres

of land between the 96th and 100th meridians of west
longitude which they sold for the sum of $l0,423,262.99,
there has been no failure on the part of the United States
to deal fairly and honorably with the Cherokee Indians in

connection with the ‘outlet’ here sued for. (Finding 23,
p. 21).

"The many references to the outlet lands indicate that

the Indian title or use thereto was not intended originally
to be of the kind of their homeland tract of 7,000,000

acres--but finally the title was made the same——a fee simple

one-—and thus became of much greater value than had been
promised." (p. 36)

In the opinion of the Court of Claims affirming the Commission's

decision, the only references to the nature of the title in the Cherokee

outlet are:

"* * * The further question whether the ‘outlet’ was to
be owned outright, or the Cherokees were to have only
hunting rights in it, or rights of passage through it to
the then open country to the west, would have been posed.
If outright ownership had been contemplated, one wonders
why the parties would have provided for the surveying and
fixing of a western line to the Cherokees‘ Arkansas lands,
since they were to won the landswest of the line in the
same way that they owned the lands to the east of it.

2 567

......"The question whether the ‘outlet’ meant

absolute ownership or merely a right of passage or

use was resolved in their favor by the issuance, in

1838, of an outright patent to them of the lands all

the way to the 100th meridian."

Did the above amount to a legal determination vi the nature of the

interest of the Cherokees is the outlet as created by the words of the
treaty of 1828? We think not. And it was not necessary for the Commission or the Court of Claims to make such 3 decision because of the

subsequent patent conveying the outlet outright. However, from the

"that under the promise

case as a whole, from the Commission's finding
of an outlet the Cherokees were to acquire he rights to the soil, but
merely an outlet" (referring to the statements which FRdG the promises,
as pointed out by petitiwser in Docket 24?), fro? the wording cf the
1828 treaty guaranteeing, is 3 spearate misuse. 2 "perpetual outlet,

Docket 2&1 would set make such an admission.
Assuming that the Cherokee freety of 3828 Cesveysd no interest in

from those used in the Delaware treaty of £839. Cther differences are

"guarantees" in the Cherokee treaty.

The important similarity is the use of the term "outlet" in both treaties

and the fact that they extend west.

The evidence shows, as we have stated, the Delaware outlet to be a

by both claimants to be at least 150 miles long by 10 miles in width.
This is by far the narrowest outlet mentioned in the other treaties.

t is also the only outlet which is much narrower than the residence

lands from which it leads. The evidence further establishes that the
residence lands of the Delawares were more than sufficient for residence
purposes at the time of the 1829 treaty. Isaac McCoy, in the 1831 report
of his Delaware survey to the Secretary of War (Pet. Ex. 109), refers

to the Kanzas and the Delawares as each having "more land than its wants
require" (p. 29). On page 31, he says: "To me, I would say respectfully,
it appears, that if one fourth part only of the Delaware Country had been
assigned to them, it would have been better, both for them and for the
5 States." Again on page 34, "Their c entry is good everywhere. Their
whole tribe less than two thousand souls, will cover a very inconsiderable
portion of it...." These facts would tend to support a possible inference that the parties to the 1829 treaty only intended that a right

of passage over the outlet with incidental rights was to pass to the

Delawares.

CONSi_3CTION PLACED ON THE GRANT BY THE PARTIES

 

The part‘es hereto agree that “in case of dotbt as to the proper
interpretation to be placed on the terms of a conveyance, the courts
also look to the construction placed on it by the parties."

joth the petitioners and the defendant have offered documentary

evidence (Def. Ex. 54; Pet. Exs. lll, ll2, ll3,”ll4-ll9 and the Pawnee

2 569
Retyped
treaty of October 9, 1833, 7 Stat. 448) from which the petitioners have
drawn the conclusion that the Delawares claimed full Indian title to
the outlet while the defendant concludes that only a passage—way or
road leading to the hunting area is shown. We shall not attempt an
analysis of each document, for in our opinion nothing appears in any
of them that helps in the solution of the question under scrutiny by
us. They generally relate to the use of hunting lands alleged to have
been traditionally Pawnee territory; it was the passage of the Indians
hostile to the Pawnees to those grounds that was their chief concern,
in other words, it was the use of the outlet which enabled the
Delawares to get to the Pawnee hunting grounds that was under discussion. Obviously, the title of the outlet was of no special interest
to any of the persons concerned in the controversy, so the statements
made and the action taken were not based upon any particular interest
of the Delawares but would apply whether the interest was that of full
Indian title or merely a roadway for reaching the hunting grounds. It
is rather clear from this evidence that the Pawnees and the Dclawares
were hostile tribes which had "long been at war” and that because of
this hostility the government would want to take some action that would
prevent conflicts on and because of the Delaware outlet, no matter what
the interest of the Delawares was in the outlet. In other words, the
reasons for the action which was taken were the same whether the Delawares had full Indian title to the outlet or only a right of passage.
Passage across the outlet by hostile Indians was the point of concern.

At first, Dougherty mentioned two possible solutions, either "preventing

.. .. ._._. .—-1- ..-rm»-.'-' 2 570

Lahthe Delawares fro going at all on the Pawnee lands to hurt” or
“obtaining from the Pawnees privilege for them to do so." (Def. Ex.
54). Objection to the former was that our Government had already‘
marked for them "a passwway of ten.miles wide, leading into that very
country.” He therefore suggested that "tte privilege, for the Delawares to hunt on their lands, be obtained." The Court of Claims in th
Pawnee case (App. Dkt. ll, p. 27, 124 C. Cls. 352) quotes from a letter
dated August 26, 1831 from General Clark to Secretary of War Lewis Cass
transmitting the letter inich is defendant's exhibit 54, and stating:
"I agree with Mr. Dougherty as to the necessity of preventing further
serious difficulties between those tribes by a timely interference

of the Government and think his plan of procuring for the Delawares
permission from the Penis to hunt on their land, a good one....."

But the solution finally adopted by the government was to obtain a
cession of any interest the Eawnees might have in the outlet and all
land lying south of the Platte river. The undisputed purpose was to
secure peace between hostile tribes. Had the Pawnees been a friendly
tribe that need the right of passage or some other right in the
Delaware outlet which could have been exercised without conflict with
the Delaware's needs, then the question of the nature of the Delaware's
interest in the outlet would have been directly involved in the nego»
tiations and resolution of the matter.

then cites a number of legal cases to support his contention that "the
ordinary use of the terms ‘land’ and ‘tract' connotes clearly an interest in the land itself and not a mere easement," that "at common law
the word ‘land’ did not include incorporeal hereditaments; an that
ordinarily, when we speak of a place or a tract, we are understood to
mean land." We do not feel that it is necessary to analyze these cases.
The legal interpretation of these phrases is not involved. As has already
been noted, it is only natural to make-such references whether the interest
of the Delawares was full Indian title or a lesser interest. Since th
Delawares were granted that interest in 1829 and from that date to the
l854 treaty no other Indian tribe was granted any oth r interest in the
outlet, one would expect during the period that terms like "Delaware

land" w nld be used rather than phrases attempting to signify some

lesser interest in the outlet, even though the Delawares had only a

lesser interest. Convenience would justify then, and their use under

these circumstances would in the briefest way describe the land in.weich
only the Delawares had been granted a recognized interest by treaty with
the United States. I

Likewise, the use of the term "tract of country" in the l854 treaty
has no connotation that full Indian title to the outlet was being ceded.
In the principal clause "the Delaware tribe of Indians hereby cede, relinquish and quitclaim to the United States....their right, title and

interest in and to the ‘outlet’ nentioned and described in said suppleI

nentary article...,” they thereby conveyed whatever interest they had

acqtirai by the 1829 treaty. The wording is appropriate for the cession

of any limited interest in the land or of full Indian title.

The defendant, on the other hand, contends that "Further evidence

that by the terms of the treaty of 1829, providing an outlet for
Eclawares, the parties intended to convey merely a right of way or a

passageway leading from the tract granted as their residence is to be

found in the fact that at all times from and after the date of tee treaty

down to the cession in 1854, the lands designated for settlement and the
‘outlet’ therefrom were considered by the Delawares and the Government

as separate and distinct interests, and that the parties in their subsequent transactions acted on this premise." 't sets out the following

from page 134 to 136: "At the outset, in the Senate resolution

Ex. 43) dated May 29, l830, ratifying the treaty, Congress made a discs-‘J-IGI-ab H V

‘granted courtly

th~

tinction between th and 'outlet‘ a.d required

that the surveyor ‘run the lines and fix the boundaries of the said

granted country and the said outlet.’" In his report (Pet. Ex. 109,

p. 18) on the survey dated April 1831, Isaac McCoy himself emphasized
the same distinction when he wrote:
"After completing our survey of the lands designed
‘for the residence, we extended our survey of the Delaware

outlet (so called) to a point 210 miles west of the State
of Missouri.”

In the same report, McCoy again made this distinction when he wrote:
"The Delawares...had instructed him (Captain John
Quick) not to remain wit" t"" work

Accompanying tne certificate of the Chief mm; the certificate of
the Indian Agent, John Campbell, in pa-t as follows:

I have further ascertained that the said Quick is

In John McCoy's account (Def. En. 51, p. 304) of the survey of the
Delaware lands and the outlet given in 1889, we find the same distinction
vividly made as follows:

The Delaware outlet was a strip of land given by the
government to the Delawares, ten miles wide and extending
from the northwest corner of t1e'Delaware lands proper,
westward to the buffalo plains. Having established the
western line and the point at the northwest corner of the
Delaware lands, it was our next work to run a random line
eastward or rather southeastward to the Missouri River at
Camp Leavenworth....

On the 13th of October we reached the mound which we had
placed at the northwest corner of the Delaware land on the
18th of September, just a month previous to the closing
of this retraced line. The course of this line was northwestwardly from Camp Leavenworth in order to reach a point
ten.miles north 0 the northeast corner of the K.nsas
Reservation for tie openin' if the tenwmile wide Delaware
outlet, which was to pass westward along the northern
boundary of the Kansas Reservation.

It can be said generally that varying inferences may be drawn from
tee distinctions made between the outlet and the residence lands or from
references to them as a unit. But to ts it is generally more significant and meaningfu1'when:separate references are made than when references

a

as a unit are made, for the simple reason that t;e.:crner would not

ordinarily be done without good reason and the latter could be done is?
convenience. In the tabulation in petitioners‘ exhibit ll0, page 753,
the Delawares are listed with eight other tribes and it would be natural
to list both together "in round numbers" rather than attempt to separate
and describe a different type of interest in the outlet, even though a
different interest actually existed. The same is true of the tabulation
in petitioners‘ exhibit 132. in t.e heading of this exhibit, it shows

tie purpose of the part referred to herein to be tb Show the quantity of
lands to which original Indian title has been ext'nguished or lands
formerly granted to Indian tribes which have been re-acquired. The
Delaware lands would come under the latter and would refer to any

interest or title re-acquired. Under “Remarks” following these figures,
it sets out that "the $10,000 are paid for the outlet of l,O00,000 acres."

But it is not natural for references to be made in two or more units,

if the same are alike and could be lumped together, unless there is good
reason therefor. Petitioner in Docket 241 suggests the reason to be the
distinction as to the use of the land. But this does not satisfactorily
explain the distinctions made in the Senate resolution (Def. Ex. 43)
ratifying the very treaty which made the grant. We believe the resolution's use of qhe terms "granted country" and "outlet" are the:most
significant of the distinctions listed by the defendant and may indicate that the officials responsible for this rcr+;ution and its adoption
by the Senate considered the interest ennyeycu in the outlet to be of a
different and lesser nature than the "granted country.” The other

reference to residence lands and the outlet, pointed out by defendant,

have less meaning. The distinctions made by Isaac McCoy and John McCoy

might be partially explained by the fact they completed the survey of
the residence lands first before extending their survey to the outlet.
The same would be true of the certificates of John Quick and agent
Campbell, together with the fact that John Quick had instructions to
remain no longer th'n to see the limits of the land assigned for settlement, which would be a reason to distinguish that land from the outlet
in their certificates. But these separate references are cumulative in
effect, following in time the Senate Resolution which provided for th
survey and made the clear distinction between the "granted country" and
the “outlet.”

The parties have offered in evidence a number of maps (Def. Exs.
46-A, 46-A(l), 50-A, B, C, D, E, G; Pet. Exs. l30, 134, 135) from which

they draw various inferences from the fact that a dividing line between

ltne "residence" and the "outlet" lands of the Delawares appears in some

of them (Def. Exs. 46-A(l) and 50-A), while here is no such line shown
in the others. An examination of these maps and the purposes for which
they were made will show that, with the exception of Def. Exs. 46-A(l)

and 50-A, there was no need for showing a division between or separation
of the Delaware "residence lands" and the "outlet" so we draw no important

$

inference from the lack of su*n a lie . On the other hand, the Isaac
McCoy map (46-A(l)) and his field notes (Def. Ex. 46-3(1)) locate and
graphically show the east boundary of the outlet in accordance with the
calls of the treaty description. This map seems to have been the basis
for many of the other maps. We think the hccoy map is of importance

as indicating a line separating the two divisions of the Delaware lands -a logical separation, in accordance with h treaty division.

TREATY OF £;Y 6, 1854

 

We come now to the treaty of May 6, 1854, l0 Stat. 1048. ne

pertinent provisions of this treaty are set forth in Finding 10 and will

be set forth in extenso here.

By Article 1 of this treaty, the Delawcres “cede, relinquisi and

quitclaim" to the United States all tbeir country "situate in the for’

and interest in and to the "outlet" meatiozed aid described in said

‘tpplemeatary article." Article 2 provided for tee survey and sale for

the benefit of the Delawares of all the land ceded, except said “outlet.”
By Article 3 of the treaty it is provided: "?he Snited States agree

ta pay to the Delaware tribe of Indians the sum of ten thzusand dollars;

and in consideration thereof, the Delaware tribe hereby cede, release and

qritnclaim to the United States, the said tract of conrtr hereinbefore

described as the "outlet". So, we see the Delaware ceded the outlet by

two provisions of the same treaty, Articles 1 and 2. And in Article 6

oo stow an intent and prrpose to treat the "outlet" as saving a start

different from ti.t of the "residence lands,” in fact, it amount to an

interpretation of the 1829 treaty in that respect because during the

far west of the "residence lands." We read from the Manypenny letter
of May 20, l854 (Pet. Ex. 129 in D. 241), transmitting the treaty,
that "some educated men? were represented in the Delaware delegation

who negotiated the treaty. This fact would indicate an understanding

"0
of the terms of the treaty respectinr the outlet -- that it was not to
be sold for the benefit of the tribe, as were the unreserved "residence
lands" dealt with in the same treaty. Th a, under the circumst'nces,
the nominal consideration, $10,000, for an area more than twice as large

as the unreserved residence land area is not without significance, for

the Indians, even the.untt.ored ones, could after some 35 years of land
dealings with the Government comprehend the distinction between their
rights to the residence lands and the outlet. Considering the two
treaty transactions involving the outlet, and the sarr unding circumr
stances, one might infer that the Indians understood that their rights
in the outlet were limited to its use for travelling to and from the
hunting ground.

Another item of evidence we believe is entitled to substantial
weight is the resolution of the Senate (Def. Ex. 43; Finding 4) passed
May 29, 1830, ratifying the 1829 treaty. This resolution also-directed

”*** to run the lines of th country by the foregoing

Treaty granted to the said Delaware Nation of Indians, to
establish certain and notorious landmarks, accurately and
permanently to distinguish the boundaries of the said

granted country and of the said outlet reserved in this
Treaty; teat the said surveyor run tie lines and fix and
establish the bO'iiI1dE3.'£:‘iC)S' of the said granted corintry and

the said outlet in the presence of an agent to be designated
by the Delaware Nation; and that it shall be the duty of the
said surveyor to report to the President of the United States
his proceedings in the premises, together with a map or draft

2 579

of the said granted country and the said outlet; and
that when the President shall be satisfied that the
said proceedings have been concurred in and approved

of by the agent of the said Delaware Nation, he shali
also approve of the same by his signature and seal of
office and cause one copy of the same to be filed among
the archives of the Government and one copy to be delivered to the agent of the Delaware Nation, for the use of
the said Nation, and which shall be thereafter binding
and conclusive upon the respective parties to the foregoing Treaty."

Separate references in said resolution to "said granted country" and
to "said outlet reserved in this Treaty" are especially significant, and
unexplainable if the interest granted in both was the same. Had the
Delawares understood that they obtained the same title to the outlet as
to their residence lands, it would be reasonable to expect them to insist
that their chosen agent accompany the surveyor in permanently distinguishing the boundaries of the outlet, instead gf in tructing him "to remain
no longer than to see the limits of the land assigned us for settlement”
(Def. Ex. 46{d)). One would also expect a definite western boundary
surveyed and designated by the surveyor before the President would approve
the same under the provisions of the conditional ratification of the
Senate. President Jackson issued a proclamation (Def. Ex. 47) on
February ll, 1831 approving the proceedings of the surveyor and accepted,
ratified and confirmed the Supplementary Article on the 24th day of
‘March, 1831 (7 Stat. 327, 328). The western end of the outlet was left
open on the official surveyor's map (Def. Ex. 46{a) and (a) (1)), as
if the length of said outlet was not important as long as the purpose

of the outlet was accomplished in giving the Delawares access to the

‘hunting grounds to the west;

There remain the allegations contained in the petition in the case
filed in the Court of Claims. (See findings ll-13). There the Indians
plainly contended they were not owners of the outlet and had only “an
easement or right of way therein" which had a value not exceeding
$5,000 when they acquired it. While we do not consider this evidence
as conclusive on the question under consideration, it is another fact
which bears upon the construction the Indians placed upon the provisions of the treaty.

.We conclude, therefore, that the petitioners have not shown they
derived Indian title to the outlet and their petition must be dismissed.

.0In view of the conclusions we have made it will not be necessary
to consider the other issues raised: western boundary of the outlet
and the effect of the release given by the Delawares. (Findings l3
and 14).

An order dismissing the petitions in Dockets Nos. 27~A and 241

must be entered.
