Decided: July 11%, 1958

FINDINGS OF FACT
1. The petitioners in Docket 1211--A are descendants of Miami
Indians who remained in Indiana when that tribe moved to Kansas in
18346 and 1811-8, or who accompanied the tribe west but later returned

to Indiana. They have not been under government supervision since

1881. The petitioners in Docket 251 comprise the tribal unit which

moved to Kansas and then to Oklahoma where they now reside. The two

petitioners constitute and represent all descendants of members of
the Miami tribe of American Indians (Miami Tribe V. United States,

Dkts. 253, 131; 5 I.C.C. 181) and are organized entities having the

capacity to present claims under the Indian Claims Commission Act of

1926. (Def. Ex. 16, p. 3, Dkt. 251)

ACPETAGE OF KANSAS RESERVATION

2. In l833 the I-Eiami tribe occupied some 968,020 acres in Ind5-ana- (stilbulation, D1-ct. 256, Tr. p. 1+) Upon the suggestion of
J. F. Schermerhorn, a United States Agent, that they could be induced to exchange these lands for l,000,000 acres west of the Mississippi river, the Secretary of War, on July 15, 1833, instructed
Governor Porter of Midnigan Territory to open negotiations vrith the
tribe, that the exact acreage of their land be ascertained by surV937 and an equal acreage provided for the tribe west of the Mississippi. This information was conveyed to the I-Iiamis at a council
called during October, 1833. Mr: Schermerhorn recommended that the
Miami accept a tract on the Marias des Cygnes, directly west of the
Missouri border, and said the President:

is willing to give you as much land there, as large
a country as you have here.

but the I1"I:‘i.a1ni Indians were unwilling to leave their reservations and

the council terminated without an agreement being reached. (Pet. EX.

3, Dirt. 251)

3-» The Secretary of War instructed the Miami agent, William
Marshall during the following year to renew the attempt to move the
Miami west. At that time, July l2, 1831-I», he directed that:

* " you will * * reduce your offer to three hundred
thousand acres and not exceed that quantity unless
you find it indispensable to the attainment of your
object, but in the last resort you may engage to
give them the Eight hundred thousand acres if nothing short will satisfy them. (Pet. Ex. 5, pp. 32,
33, Dkt. 251)

6 51b,|_,—

During the conference called by Agent Marshall the treaty of October

23, 1834, '7 Stat. ll-63, was concluded, the Miami Indians ceding Indiana

land totalling 250,560 acres. The Tribe continued to hold over 700,000

acres in Indiana and no provision was made with respect to it moving

west. The Senate having amended the treaty, it was returned during

October, 1837, to Colonel A. C. Pepper, the then Agent for the Miami

Indians, who secured tribal approval to the amendment. At the same

time Colonel Pepper was instructed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to conclude a new treaty calling for a Miami delegation to select a permanent residence for the tribe in the west. Colonel Pepper

was to be guided by the instructions previously issued with respect to

procuring a cession of the Miami land.
1+. Colonel Pepper procured additional cessions from the Miami Indians in a treaty concluded Hovember 6, 1838, 7 Stat.‘ 561. The Miami

retained 501719 491,000 acres in Indiana, and from the cessions made re»
served a small. tract of approximately 10 square miles for the band of

Ma-to-sin-ia, made a number of grants to individuals, and it was stipulated:

ART. 10. The United States stipulate to possess, the Miami tribe of Indians of, and guaranty to them forever, a
country west of the Mississippi river, to remove to and
settle on, when the said tribe may be disposed to emigrate
from their present country, and that guaranty is hereby
pledged: And the said country shall be sufficient in extent, and suited to their wants and condition and be in a
region contiguous to that in the occupation of the tribes
which emigrated from the States of Ohio and Indiana. And
when the said tribe shall have emigrated, the United States
shall protect the said tribe and the people thereof, in
their rights and possessions, against the injuries, encroachments and oppressions of any person or persons, tribe or
tribes whatsoever.

6 515,, 

ART. ll. It is further stipulated, that the United States
will defray the expenses of a deputation of six chiefs or
Eeadmen, to explore the country to be assigned to said tribe,
west of the Mississippi river.

ART. lb. And whereas John B. Richardville, the principal
chief of said tribe, is very old and infirm, and not well
able to endure the fatigue of a long journey, it is agreed
that the United States will pay to him and his family the

proportion of the annuity of said tribe which their number
shall indicate to be due to them, at Fort Wayne whenever

the said tribe shall emigrate to the country to be assigned them west, as a future residence.
In his report on the treaty, addressed to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Colonel ?epper commented:

In negotiating for the tract ceded, especial regard was paid
to the policy and wishes of the government, to procure the
removal of this tribe West of the Mississippi. * * I am hap-py to say that their dispositions appear favorable to a removal. You will discover that the anxiety manifested as to
the situation and extent of the country West to be assigned
them and the provisions made for their protection there, point
strongly to a contemplated removal. * * * Article (ll!-) provides for the payment of that portion of the annuity belonging to the principal Chief and his family, at Fort Wayne in
the event of the emigration of the tribe.

Private conversations with him convince me of his profound
sense of the necessity of his tribe removing soon. Their
present situation, within narrow limits, surrounded on every side with a white population, presents the alternative

of speedy extinction or removal. In short, the numerous.
cautious provisions inserted in the treaty and proposed '

for insertion, convince me that the government's wish for

the removal of this tribe is powerfully seconded by their inclinations and necessities. (Pet. Ex. 8. PP. 11-9-50. Dkt- 251)

5. (a) Proceeding under unofficial instructions which have since
38001118 misplaced, Agents Samuel I-Kilroy and Allen Hamilton entered into
Turther negotiations with the tribe during November, 18140, and on the
28th of that month concluded a treaty, 7 Stat. 582, wherein in Article

I the Miami made a number of individual land grants and then ceded the

6 516 :3

remainder of their tribal land in Indiana, estimated at 500,000 acres,

for the recited consideration of $550,000. (Pet. Ebcs. 9-l0, Dkt. 251)

In Article 5 it was recited that since the late war chief, Francis Godfroy had‘. bequeathed to his children a large estate which could not be
sold until the youngest was 21 years of age, that the United States
should pay to the family of said chief their just proportion of the annuities of said tribe, "at Fort Wayne, from and after the time the tribe
shall emigrate to the country assigned to them west of the Mississippi.“
Article seven stipulated that the reservation held by Ha-to--sin-ia should
be patented to his son, Me-shing-go-me-sia, in trust for said band, and
the provisions in favor of John B. Richardville and family, in Article

14, Treaty of November 6, 1838, were extended to Mae-shing-go-me-sia and

his brothers. Article eight then provided:

It is hereby stipulated that the Miami tribe of Indians
sh2.'ll_ remove to the country assigned them west of the
Mississippi, within five years from this date: * *

(b) The Senate of the United States on February 25, 185:1, amended the treaty by the addition of Article 12, which read:
The United States hereby stipulate to set apart and asSign to the I-Iiamies, for their occupancy west of the Hississippi, a tract of country bounded on the east by the
State of Missouri, on the north by the country of the Weas
and Kaskaskias, on the west by the Pottawatomies of Indiana, and on the south by the land assigned to the Eew York
Indians, estimated to contain five hundred thousand acres.
The amended treaty was then submitted to the Miami tribe for approval.

Agents Kilroy and Hamilton reported to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs

that the tribe had been called into council and had been informed that if

it didnot like the treaty it could be abrogated by the withholding of

6 517

'bal approval, and "with a full knowledge of the effect of their
assent when given, they willingly gave it," (Pe£- EX- 15. Dkt- 251)
in.Hay, 1841. As amended, the treaty was proclaimed on June 7, 18h1.

Agents.Mi1roy and Hamilton reported that a portion of the Ma-tosin-ia band might remain upon its reservation when the tribe moved
west but that it would have been difficult, if at all possible, to
obtain the consent of this band to the cession without this provision; that the provision concerning the Godfroy family was necessary
to assure them an advantageous sale of their land. Agents Kilroy,
Hamilton and Pepper each explained that individual land grants were
used as a means of awarding members of the tribe for services rendered to it, and of equalizing tribal assets; that the grants were
usually soon sold and the proceeds divided among the persons consic d entitled thereto. (Pet. Exs. 8, 10, Dkt. 251)

6. It was estimated that the Miami tribe by the treaty of 1840
ceded from 500,000 to 511,000 acres of land in Indiana. The Senate
amendment to their 1800 treaty recited that the tract to be set aside
to that tribe in Kansas was estimated to contain 500,000 acres. In
185b, when transmitting the Miami treaty of June 5, 1850, wherein the
tribe ceded the Kansas tract, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
Hanypenny, commented to the Secretary of the Interior as follows:

The actual quantity of land however within the boundaries named within the article referred to (Article

12, Treaty of 1800) does not probably exceed 370,000

acres, and in the conference between the Indians and

myself this matter of differences was discussed and
‘was fully understood by them, and it was an element

in the purchase of the land.

6 518.

7. The Commission finds that there was no agreement between the
United States and the Miami tribe that said tribe should be placed in
possession of a tract of land in the west 500,000 acres in extent, or
equivalent in acres to the Indiana land ceded by the Miami tribe in
1830. The Commission finds that the United States promised said tribe
a tract within the region inhabited by Indians formerly residing in
Ohio and Indiana which tract should be sufficient in size to care far
their wants; that the United States through the Senate Amendment of
February 25, l8Ql, to the.Miami treaty of 1840, tendered the Hiami
tribe a tract of land in Kansas sufficient in acreage and within a
region.meeting the specifications recited above, which tract the Hiami tribe accepted by assenting to said amendment at a tribal council
called during May, 1841, for the purpose of considering that amendment. ‘While the amendment recited that said tract was estimated to

contain 500,000 acres, the accuracy of that estimate was not a condition of the tender nor of its acceptance.

Ownership of the Kansas Land
8. By Joint Resolution ofIMarch 3, l8#§, 6 Stat. 942, Congress
extended Francei Slocum, her children and.grandchildren, in all 22
aersons, permission to draw their share of tribal annuities in Indiana after the Miami tribe moved west, subject, however, to the restriction that:

If the aforesaid Indians, their descendants, or any part
thereof shall remove to the country west of the Mississippi river assigned to the Miami tribe of Indians, then
and in such case, the portions or shares of annuities or
other moneys payable to the tribe shall be paid to such

persons so removing at the place of payment of annuities
to said tribe of Indians. ‘

6 S19

.In

_..e same privilege was extended to 12 other I-Iiami Indians, their families and descendants, by a Joint Resolution on May 1, 1850, 9 Stat. 806.

Neither of these resolutions was approved nor sanctioned by the Miami
tribe in Kansas nor by the Miami Indians who remained in Indiana under

treaty provisions to so do.

9. In 1846 the Miami tribe emigrated to Kansas. (Pet. ER. 220,
Dkt. 251) Members of the Godfroy family, possibly members of the
Richardville family although that Chief died in 1831, Me-sing--go--mesia and his brothers, the 22 persons named in the Joint Resolution of
181:5, some members of Ma-to-sin-ia‘s band, and perhaps others remained in Indiana. In all, 161 persons drew annuities there. Sixty-one
of said persons migrated to Kansas‘ during 1814-8. (Pet. Exs. 28, Dkts.
3’ -A, 221, 222; Dkt. 251) The tribe suffered a severe numerical
loss through illness during its first years in Kansas, (Dkt. 251, Def.
Ex. 1, p. 12), and an undisclosed number of its members returned to
Indiana. In 1851+ there were 302 Miami Indians residing in Indiana
md only 2&8 living in Kansas.

10. Payment of tribal annuities to the parties named in the
Joint Resolutions wasfobjected to by those Miami Indians in Kansas
ad by those remaining in Indiana under treaty provisions. At a
council held with the Western Fiami at Osage River Agency on October
4-, 1853, they complained:

We were told in our last treaty that all our Annuities

should be paid west of the Missouri, and if any remained behind in Indiana they should receive nothing. When

we first came here we received all our Annuities - but

for a few years it has been changed and now the largest

part is paid to those who remained and have-went back to
Indiana.

11; (a) The preamble to the treaty of June 5, l854, 10 Stat.
l093, recites that it was concluded in'Washington between George'W.
Manypenny, as representative of the United States, and

the following named delegates representing the Miami

tribe of Indians, viz: Nahwwe-lan-quah, or Big Legs;

Na-cat-a-chin-quah, or Little Doctor; Lan-a-pin-cha,

or Jack Eackley; So-ne-lan-gish-eah, or John Bowrie;

and‘Wan-zop-e-ah} they being thereto duly authorized

by said tribe - and Me-shin-go-me-zia, Po-con-ge-ah,

Pin-yi-ot-te-mah,‘Wop-pop—pe-tah, or Bondy, and Ke-ahcot-wah, or Buffalo, Miami Indians, residents of the

State of Indiana, being present, and assenting, approving, agreeing to, and confirming said articles of

agreement and convention. '

The scant notes taken during the meetings prior to the execution
of the treaty disclose that the Indiana Indians stated that they were
present solely to discuss who in Indiana was entitled to participate in
the tribal annuities, and that they had no authority to represent the
Indiana Miami in any treaty negotiations; (Pet. Ex. 31, p. 158, Dkt. 251)
that the Western or Kansas.Hiami claimed only three families in Indiana
were entitled to receive tribal annuities, denied that the Indiana.Miami
Indians were present because of the proposed treaty, and that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs agreed with them that the Indiana Miami had
no interest in the Kansas land. (Pet. Ex. 27,'Dkt. 12h-A)

(b) The land ceded in Article 1, Treaty of 185%, is described
therein precisely as that granted to the Miami tribe by Article 12, Treaty of l840,'both tracts being estimated to contain 500,000 acres. ‘Within
the ceded area, the Miami reserved 70,000 acres about their residence

buildings for allotment purposes and 640 acres for school purposes. The

original reservation is identified as Tract 329 upon Royce's map of Kan._.a:l-'.':I',4:
:,_. . I

J 2, Vol. l8, B.A.E., and contained 32h,796.88 acres; the re8€TV€d
area contained 70,638.5b acres and is identified upon said Map as Tract
330. Defendant's Exhibit No. 2, Dkt. 251, which is made a part of this
finding, depicts the reservation and reserved area as later surveyed.

(c) Article 3, Treaty of June 5, l854, reads:

In consideration of the cession hereinbefore made, the
United States agree to pay to thelmiami tribe of Indians
the sum of two hundred thousand dollars, in manner as follows; viz: Twenty annual instalments of seven thousand
five hundred dollars each, the first payable on the first
day of October, one thousand and eight hundred and sixty,
and the remainder to be paid respectively on the first day
of October of each succeeding year, until the whole shall
have been paid; and the remaining fifty thousand dollars
shall be invested by the President in safe and profitable
stocks, the interest thereon to be applied, under his direction, for educational purposes, or such objects of a
beneficial character, for the good of the tribe, as may

be considered necessary and expedient; and hereafter, whenever the President shall think proper, the sum thus provided
to be invested, may be converted into money, and the same
paid to the tribe in such manner as he may judge to be best

for their interests. No part of the moneys in this or the
preceding article mentioned shall ever be appropriated or

paid to the persons, families, or bands, who, by the fourteenth article of the treaty of “ovember sixth, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight, by the fifth and seventh articles of the treaty of November twenty-eight, one
thousand eight hundred and forty, or by virtue of two resolutions of Congress, approved March third, one thousand
eight hundred and forty-five, and May first, one thousand
eight hundred and fifty, or otherwise, are permitted to
draw or have drawn, in the state of Indiana, their proportion of the annuities of the Miami tribe. (underscoring supplied)

The articles of previous treaties referred to in the above quotation, are those permitting John B. Richardville and his family, the family of Francis Godfroy, and Me-shing-go-me-sia and his brothers, to receive

their proportionate share of tribal annuities at Fort Wayne, Indiana, after the tribe emigrated to the country assigned to it in the west. The

5 522,

Fichardville and Godfroy famillies had been granted several tracts in Indiana_ under treaties executed by the Miami tribe between l8l8 and l8!’-$0,

inclusive.

(d) Articles 1+ and 5, Treaty of 1851;, provided for the commutationof the tribal annuities, the settlement of claims against the

United States, and the distribution of funds. The items commuted and

the consideration paid therefor were:

1. Treaty of November 28, 1840:

The remaining installments of $12, 500 annually accruing under Article 2 were to be paid $6,863.61: to the
Iiami Indians in Indiana and $5,636.36 to the 
Indians in Kansas.

2. Treaty of October 5, l8l8:

The permanent services promised in Article 5, treaty

of 1818, a blacksmith and a miller, were to continue
for the benefit of the Miami Indians in Kansas.

3. Treaty of 1826, and Others:

In consideration of the sum of $421,038.68, payable
$190,}-+314-.68 to the M:'Lami in Kansas and $231,000, to

the Miami Indians in Indiana, in six equal installments, the Iviiazni tribe released the annuity of $25,000
under Article 14, Treaty of October 23, 1826, all permanent provisions for money in lieu of laborers ,' for
agricultural assistance, tobacco, iron, steel, salt
and all other annuities of any kind created by former
treaties; and satisfied all claims against the United
States for damages due on account of nonfulfillment of
any treaty stipulations, or injuries to, destruction of
or loss of property by wrongful acts of the United States
or its citizens or agents.

Distribution of the annuity sums was computed on the ratio of 214-8 Miami Indians residing in Kansas and 302 Miarni
Indians residing in Indiana. (Pet. Ex. 2&5, Dkt. 251)

1-I». In consideration of $30,000 paid in three installments to the Kansas Miami, the tribe released claims
for: $8,000.68 appropriated to pay for improvements
but returned to the general fund in the United States

__..Juries or property losses were presented for consideration and are referred to in Item 4 above.
sioner advised the Miami he considered the $25,000 annuity referred to
in Item 5 above to be less than permanent in nature because in the 1826
treaty establishing that annuity it was specified that it “shall be paid

to them. as long as they exist together as a tribe; which several sums

Treasury; $14,223.50 accumulated in appropriations for
the support of the poor and infirm, and the education
of the youth of the tribe as provided by the treaties
of October 23, 1826, and November 6, 1838, and claims
of the Kansas Miami for damage and loss of stock and
other property resulting from their removal west.

The annuity of $25,000 before released was nevertheless to be paid for the years l854 and 1855 and divided between the Hiami Indians in Indiana and those in
Kansas in the same ratio as the $12,500 payment above
referred to.

Unexpended appropriations for iron, salt, steel, tobacco, etc., in the sum of $h,059.08 were to be paid
to the Miami in Indiana.

It was specified only the 302 persons named on the
list of Indianalhiami agreed to in June, 1854, and
their descendants, should participate as Indiana

Miami Indians unless the inclusion of such additional persons should.have been first approved by the
Indiana Miami in open council. (Article 4, 185A Treaty)

There is no evidence suggesting what, if any, claims, damages, inThe council minutes reflect that the Commisare to include the annuities due by preceding treaties to the said tribe.”

It.

does not appear that defendant possessed and.withheld any information touch6 525 -‘

ing the value of the  land or that the defendant engaged in deception, duress, coercion or over-reaching.

l2. There was orginally included in Article 14 of the 18514 treaty a provision that the $231,004 accruing to the Indiana Miami Indians
upon cormutation of the annuities should be invested by the United States
and the interest therefrom annually paid those Indians if they so desired:

and the said Miami Indians now present from the State of I
Indiana, agree to take the opinion of their people on
their return home, and advise the department without de.lay. (Pet. Ex. 36, p. 175, Dkt. 251)

Thereafter a full council of the I-fiami Indians in Indiana was called and a delegation dispatched to Washington to secure an amendment to

the treaty. (Pet. Ex. 17, p. 2, Dkt. 251) While in Executive Session
on August IL, 18514», the United States Senate struck the provision above

quoted, and substituted therefor the following:

The sum of two hundred and thirty-one thousand and four
dollars hereby stipulated to be paid to the  Indians of Indiana, shall be held by the United States for

said last-named Indians, and by the government invested,

as the President; may direct, at an interest of five per
cent, per annum, and which interest shall be paid annually, for the period of twenty-five years, to the said
Miami Indians of Indiana, * *; Provided: That no persons
other than those embraced in the corrected list agreed upon by the Miamis of Indiana, in the presence of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in June, eighteen hundred and
fifty-four, comprising three hundred and two names as Miami
Indians of Indiana, and the increase of the families of the
persons embraced in said corrected list, shall be recipients
of the payments, annuities, commtation moneys and interest
hereby stipulated to be paid to the Miami Indians of Indiana,
unless other persons shall be added to said list by the consent of the said Eiiami Indians of.‘ Indiana, obtained in council, according to the custom of the Miami tribe of Indians:
Provided: That the sum of nine thousand seven hundred and
forty-six dollars and fourteen cents shall immediately be

paid out of said sum * * to the following persons, who are
a portion of the Miami tribe of Indians residing in Indiana,
and in the following manner; * *

The Miami Indians of Indiana, being now represented in
"Washington by a fully authorized deputation, and having requested the foregoing amendments, the same are binding on
them; but these amendments are in no way to affect or impair
the stipulations in said treaty contained, as to the Miamies
west of the Mississippi, the said amendments being final,

and not required to be submitted to the Miamies for their consent:

The amended treaty was ratified and proclaimed August M, 185b,

10 Stat. 1093.

13. The Miami Indians remaining within Indiana without tribal
consent, and those returning to Indiana from Kansas without tribal consent, severed their tribal relationship and lost all right to participate in the tribal assets, funds or property. Such Indians united with
and formed a single unit with Miami Indians rightfully within the state
under tribal permission granted to them by the treaties of November 6,
1838, and November 28, 1840. This united group are the petitioners in
Docket No. 124-A. By participaoing in and approving the Miami treaty
of 1854, said parties agreed to a division of the tribal assets in which
they were, or claimed to be, entitled to participate, and accepted certain moneys, benefits and considerations as recited in said treaty, and
‘waived all claim to other tribal assets, including the Miami reservation
land in Kansas. Such election or elections set out in the 1854 treaty

are binding upon said parties and their descendants, the petitioners in

Docket No. 124-A.

Commuted Annuities

lb. The commutation of an annuity is in effect but a change in

the form of investment of tribal funds. (Potawatomi Tribe vs. United

States, 2 I.C.C. 207, 230) The capital value of an annuity is that

sun which is necessary at current interest rates to produce annually
the amount of the annuity. On the date of commutation of the annuities
due to the Miami tribe, June 5, 1850, the Miami were entitled to annual
money payments of $25,000 and to annual services, goods or materials of

the value of $1,540 according to the agreement of the parties hereto,

or a total of $26,540. At that time the prevailing interest rate was

five per cent per annum, and the capital value of said annuities was

$530,800.

Alcea Band of Tillamooks et al., vs. United States, ll5 C.

 

Cls. 453, 3&1 U. 5. M8, 95 L. ed 738; Pet. Ex. 27, p. 209, Dkt. 251.

The contingency appearing in Article 4, Treaty of October 23, l826,
7 Stat. 300, limiting the $25,000 annuity commuted in 1854 to "as long
as they (the Miami) exist together as a tribe," reduces that annuity to
less than permanent. The release of unspecified claims and commutation
of the annuities mentioned in exchange for the benefits derived from receipt of a larger sum at the time, which forms part of the agreed consideration, and the cash payment of $471,438.68, was not unfair, dishonorable nor unconscionable. No evidence of fraud, duress, undue influence

or over-reaching has been shown.

The Interest Claims
l5.

A list of 302 persons which the five representatives of the

Indiana Miami agreed.were all those entitled to reside in Indiana and

6 527

participate in the tribal annuities, was attached to the 1854 treatySubsequently other persons in Indiana claimed to be of Miami blood and

entitled to participate. On June 12, 1858, Congress directed: (sec- 3.

ll Stat. 329, 332)

And be it further enacted, that the Secretary of the Interior be and he is hereby, authorized and directed to

pay to such persons of Miami blood as have heretofore been
excluded from the annuities of the tribe since the removal
of the Miamies in eighteen hundred and forty-six and since
the treaty of eighteen hundred and fifty-four. 3nd'Wh05€
names are not included in the supplement to said treaty,
their proportion of the tribal annuities from which they
have been excluded, and he is also authorized and directed
to enroll such persons upon the pay list of Said tribe. 9nd
cause their annuities to be paid to them in future; Provided.
That the foregoing payments shall be in full of all claims
for annuities arising out of previous treaties. And said
Secretary is also authorized and directed to cause to be located for such persons each two hundred acres of land out of
the tract of seventy thousand acres reserved by the second
article of the treaty of June fifth, eighteen hundred and
fifty-four, with the Miamies, to be held by such persons by
the same tenure as the locations of individuals are held
which have been made under the third article of said treaty.

is a result, in November, 1858, patents issued to 73 persons conveying
to them lh,533.38 acres of Miami land in Kansas, without tribal consent thereto.

16. An Act to abolish the Miami tribal relations was adopted on
harch 3, l8_73, 17 Stat. 631, and the sale of Miami land in Kansas was
authorized on May 15, 1882, 22 Stat. 63. t was directed that a census
be taken of the Miami Indians; that the amount of annuities paid to iniividuals referred to in the Act of June 12, l858, and charged to Miami

ZndianS'WhOSe names appeared on the corrected list of l854 be ascertained and charged against the proceeds of the Kansas land; and that it be

determined whether any persons on that list were entitled to allotments
in Kansas, and, if so, they'were to be paid therefor. Questions arising
in connection therewith were referred to the Court of Claims under Section 2, Act of Maroh_3, 1883, Chapter 116, by the Committee of Indian
Affairs for the House of Representatives. A certified copy of that
Court's Statement, Findings, and Conclusions, filed January 5, 1891,

was thereafter transmitted to the Committee.

(a) The Court found as fact that most of the Miami tribe had
moved to Kansas in 1846; that a large number of the tribe, besides those
who had special permission under treaties and Acts of Congress to remain
in Indiana, did not migrate to Kansas but remained in ‘Indiana and adjacent states, and that the tribal annuities were divided from 1846 to 1854
between those Miami in Indiana and those in Kansas; that in June, 1854,
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and.the Indiana Miami representatives
then in Washington had revised and corrected the list of those Miami in
Endiana who were entitled to participate in funds payable to the Miami
Indians living in Indiana, which list of 302 persons is referred to and
made part of the Senate Amendment to the Miami treaty of 1854.

The court also found.that'under the act of.1858 the Secretary of the
nterior had recognized 73 additional persons in Indiana as being of parial Miami blood; that said 73 persons were thereafter allotted 200 acres
aoh out of the 70,000 acre reserve in Kansas; that said selections agregated 14,533.38 acres, were reported July 18, 1859, and approved Octo:r 7, 1859; that said 73 persons received $2,679.76 from that portion of
.2,50O belonging to the Western (Kansas) Miami per Article 2 of the 1854

eaty, and $15,691.12 from funds accruing to said Indians per Article 4

 

of said treaty, all without consultation with the tribe or the consent

of its chiefs; that said persons were enrolled as Miami Indians of Indiana and received annuities in common with said group for a number of
years; that said persons did not emigrate west with the tribe, did not
reside upon the land ceded in 1854 prior to such allotments but remained in the east, and that it was not shown that said 73 Persons, most of
whom were stricken from the list of Indiana Miami under authority of an
opinion issued by the Attorney General in 1867 (12 Atty. Genl. Op., p.
236). were of Miami blood.

The Court concluded: "The reasonable value of the land so allotted to said 73 persons in November, l859, the date of the approval of
the Secretary of the Interior, was an average of $3 Per acre, amount_ng in the aggregate to $93,600.10." (Ct. Cls., Congressional Case
No. 1343: Pet. Ex. 207, pm. 251)

17. On March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1000, there was appropriated and
paid the Western Miami lndians $18,370.89 as a return of funds appropriated and $43,600.14 as payment for lands allotted said 73 persons
as above recited. On March 2, 1895, 28 Stat. 903, there was appropriated for repayment to the Miami Indians of Indiana who then numbered
439, the sum.of $48,528.38 as a return of the sun taken from their
tribal funds and paid said 73 persons. (Ct. Cls., Congressional Case
No. 9255; Sen. Misc. Doc. 131, 53 Cong., 3d Sess.; Def. Ex. 16, p. 2,
Dkt. 251).

18. The Government's sovereign immunity to interest charges upon

2 obligations is not waived by 60 Stat. l0b9. In the absence of such

waiver, this Commission is without authority to grant an award for interest upon funds diverted from tribal annuity payments due petitioners,

(Loval Band or Grogg_of Creek Indians vs. Qnited States, 118 Ct. C15. 373)

 

or upon the sum paid in lieu of restitution of tribal lands erroneously
allotted to non-Miami persons.

l9. The annexation of Texas in 18b5, settlement of the OregonCanada boundary dispute in l846, the Mexican cession of l8h8, and the
discovery of gold in California in 18b9, all contributed to a westward

migration in the United States. The President was authorized to extinguish Indian title to that country‘west of Iowa and Missouri, 10 Stat.
225. 238, and in December, 1853, a bill to organize the Territories of

Kansas and Nebraska‘was introduced in Congress. The prompt removal of

the Indians tribes from that country was considered advisable, and in
May. 1854, six.treaties, three of outright purchase and three trust agreements with the United States to survey, advertise and sell tribal

land for the benefit of the several tribes, were negotiated with Kansas

Indians. A delegation of the Miami tribe, duly authorized to negotiate

for the cession of the tribal land in Kansas, arrived in Washington the
latter part of that month. (Pet. Ex. 26, Dkt. l24-A)

20. Negotiations with the Eiami delegations opened.Rby'23, 1854.

The Kansas delegation offered to cede all but 70,000 acres of the tribal land “providing their is an agreement to the extent of territory and

price of the same." The delegation argued that the tribe had been promised a country west equal if not larger than the land ceded in 1840, but

_.._..

nat Congressional unfamiliarity with the lands of bordering tribes had
resulted in it receiving only a little over half of an estimated 500,000
aCT95s and 3$k9d $1.00 per acre for such land. (Pet. Exs. 31, pp. 155,
32, 33; Dkt. 251).

t rejected the Commissioner's counter-offer to sell

the land at public auction for the benefit of the tribe, and on June 2,

1850, the delegates wrote the Commissioner as follows: (Pet. Ex. 34, Dkt.

251):

Your red children have had a consultation on the proposition you made us this morning for Our Country West. ‘We
are very near together. Our price was 75 cts as the lowest our people would consent to sell for such were our
‘views. ‘We have finally agreed to take 70 cts per acre for
the ballance reserving as per our ‘choice .’_70,C00 acms, This
is less than we intended to sell it for, yet to have it in

some form in which our people West can understand more fully we have agreed to the above stated price per Acre.
“non the Commissioner rejecting this offer, the delegation offered to acCept $200,000, payable substantially as appears in the treaty of June 5,
1854, pertinent portions of which are recited in our Finding of Fact No.
11 hereinabove. Simultaneously with negotiations for the sale of the
Kansas land, negotiations were conducted with both the delegations for
an adjustment of annuity and other claims, for the commutation of all annuities, and a division of the tribal assets.’ The final terms of settlement as incorporated into the treaty are also recited in our Finding of
Fact No. 11 hereinabove.

21. Six days before the Miami cession, on May 30, 185$, 10 Stat.
277, the Kansas Territorial Act was adopted. The State was admitted into the Union on January 29, 1861, 12 Stat. 126, at which time it had a

population of 107,206 souls. Among the land policies and laws which beme effective wdiji the passage of the Territorial Act, or shortly thereafter, were the following:

(1) The Act of April 24, l820, 3 Stat. 566, which Act provided
for the disposal of the public domain at public auctions in 80-acre tracts
to the highest bidder for cash, at not less than $1.25 per acre. After
the close of such public sales the unsold land was available in tracts of
640 acres or less at the minimum price of $1.25 per acre.

(2). The Pre-emption Act of 1841, 5 Stat. #53, which permitted
settlers to enter upon not more than l50 acres of the unsurveyed public
domain and hold preferential rights to purchase the tract entered upon
at the minimum price of $1.25 per acre, payable after the land was proclaimed for sale. The minimum price per acre thus became the maximum
price per acre. Sales of “claims” of such pre-emption settlers'were
commonly effected, and were recognized by the government.

(3) The Graduation Act of August b, 1854, 10 Stat. 574,'which
was first proposed during 18b0, reduced the minimum price of unsold land
which had been on the market for ten years to $1.00 per acre, that which
had been on the market for 15 years to 75¢ per acre, that which had been
on the market for 20 years to 50¢ per acre, that which had been on the
market for 25 years to 25¢ per acre, and that which had remained upon
the market for 30 years or more to l2%¢ per acre. No land so1d.in Kansas under the Graduation Act, which was replaced by the Homestead Act
of June 2, 1862.

(h) Numerous Congressional Acts dealt with the issuance to

certain classes of individuals of military script and warrants which

6 533

gre applicable to land pxnchases. Beginning in 1852 a series of Acts

made all such warrants assignable. ‘When used for purchasing selected

land, they were credited at $1.25 per acre, but in 1854 such warrants

were obtainable for about $1.10 each.

(5) By the Military Bounty Act of March 3, 1855, 10 Stat.

701, all officers and soldiers who had served the United States in any

‘war since the Revolution, were granted 160 acres or so much as, with
‘what had previously been allowed the3'would equal that amount. Over
33,000,000 acres were subject to being granted under this act.

22. On July 22, 185k, 10 Stat. 308, Kansas public land to which
Indian title had been extinguished,'was ordered surveyed and sold, subject to pre-emption rights. However, under the Graduation Act, the
onening of new land in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, the Military Bounby Act of 1855, and hugh donations of public land for financing construction of railroads and internal improvements (l5,680,000 acres being nade available during 1856) which were offered for sale, the general land market was saturated, and public land in Kansas, with minor
exceptions, was held off the market until after July 1, 1857. The.Miami reservation was not surveyed until 1856. The reserve selections of

70,640 acres were not completed and approved until April 1859. The ceded land was opened for settlement in 1859 at which time 35.2% of the

land'waS occupied.by pre-emption "squatters." The first public sales

were held in l863, at which time 5b.7% ‘as pre-empted. By the end of

1863, 73.5% f the land had been sold. At the close of 1869, 97.8%

wassold, pre-empted or homesteaded. (Pet. Exs. 200, 122, 215, Dkt. 251)

The original entry books of the various land offices within‘ the reservation area disclose that the Miami land, exclusive  the school sections and land disposed of by other than sale, had the following sales

record: (Def. Ex. 1, p. 101, Dkt. 251)

23. Between July 1, 1857, and September 30, 1861, only 184,000
acres were sold for cash in the State of Kansas, while 3,617,000 acres
were granted for military purposes, 2,891,000 acres for schools and
500,000 acres for internal improvements. The sales pattern demonstrates
a definite preference for timber land with open prairie attached.

234. By 18514 the population density of the'United States was shifting westward. Immigration into the country had been steadily increasing
and the unsettled land in the west with its more frugal but less expensive life was a magnetic attraction. Pioneers from our eastern states
and emigrants from abroad, accustomed to a timbered country, clearly
preferred the timbered areas, and their settlements followed westward

along the streams or along the emigrant roads. None of these roads

reached the Miami tract, the nearest one being L15 miles north, at West‘t, the present city of Kansas City, but settlements followed up the
Osage river in western Efissouri, and by 1854 the valley land immediately east. of the Miami tract was well settled. The entire population of
Missouri had averaged two to six persons per square mile in 181:0, including in that bracket a comparable area of 350,000 acres along the
Osage river, adjacent to the Miami reservation on the east, but with
a density of 18 to 1.55 persons-per-square-mile in the vicinity of Kansas City. By 1850 the 18 to 1+5 persons-per-square-mile belt extended
south from Kansas City nearly as far as the northern limits of the Hiami reservation. The area opposite the upper one-fourth of the reservation contained six to eighteen persons-per-square-mile, but two to
six persms—per-square-mile was standard in Missouri along the balance
yr the Miami reservation. (Def. Ex. 1, pp. 77-80, Dkt. 251)

The following table of immigration figures and of public land sales

rithin the United States indicates a relationship between the two:

1853 369 , 000 3 , 787 , 000
1854 428,000 13,823,000

25. The obvious preference for homesites along the established
nigrant routes and along the waterways within timbered areas resulted
3 the less attractive land, particularly within the older states, reaining unsettled or being abandoned in favor of more preferable sites

1 the west. Because of a forfeiture of about 33% of the land and a

default of approximately 14035 of the purchase price of all credit sales
of public land east of Kansas, by 1840 Congress had become greatly concerned with the methods of acquisition and disposition of the public
domain. Numerous investigations were conducted, a number of bills designed to reduce the amount of unsold public land were proposed, and
numerous Congressional Committee reports were made before 1855. These
reports disclose that’ on June 30, 1853, there were 22,722,000 acres of
unsold and unappropriated public land in Missouri alone, and there were
22,773,000 acres unsold in Iowa; that over 20,000,000 acres in each
state remained unsold a year later. The Graduation Act of August 1+,
1851+, offered such land at reduced prices, graduated according to the
number of years it had been on the market.

The five classes of land

with separate prices for each, and the acreage affected thereby, follow:

Three hundred fifteen thousand acres of the 50,000 acre tract in
Missouri, adjoining the  reservation on the east, which defendant's
expert valuation witness, Dr. Murray, used for comparison purposes, came
under the Graduation Act, over three-fourths of the entire tract having
been on the market for more than ten years by 1851!.-.

During the last half of 18514, 3,916,000 acres of the public domain

sold at $1.25 per acre, of which 295,000 acres were in lassouri; 191,000

6 537

a as sold at $1.00 of which 66,000 acres were in Missouri, and 4,100,000
acres sold at l2%¢ per acre, of which 975,000 acres were in Missouri. In
the first half of 1855, 3,000,000 acres sold at $1.25; of 2,791,000 acres
selling at other graduated prices, 1,600,000 acres sold at l2%¢ per acre
and 781,000 acres of that class laid in Missouri.

A.prospective purchaser of the Miami land in 1854 would have been
aware of the amount of competitive public land then available, and of
the fact that legislation had been pending in Congress since l8#0 looking toward the reduction of its price. The eminent passage of such legislation would have been anticipated by such purchaser and would have
been an influential element in determining the price a willing purchaser
‘would agree to pay for the.Miami tract.

26. In 1850 there were considerable military scrip and military

‘warrants outstanding and applicable to the purchase of small acreages

of the public domain. These were obtainable at a slight discount but
a purchaser of a tract as large as the Miami tract would have realized
‘but little savings through acquiring scrip or warrants for application
upon its purchase price. In any event, whether acquiring scrip and warrants or paying cash for the land, the ordinary purchaser would have considered the cost of financing his transaction, and in l854.money was
scarce. .A slight economic recession was felt throughout the entire
country in 1853 and 1854. Long term bond issues of the United States
and individual states drew 5 and 6% interest. Since these usually

sold at a premium, the rate was actually slightly less than 6%. Rates

on short term investments were markedly higher, and first class com6

the money centers of that time. By state law Missouri prohibited
interest in excess of  but short term bond and mortgage money
drew from 10 to l2%-% there in 1852 and Missouri banks were paying
6,55 on restricted deposits in 1854. Better economic conditions during the next few years, together with the effect of the Graduation
Act, gave impetus to"'a short-lived land boom in the west, which
peaked in 1857, was followed by a drought in 1858 and 1859, and
the Civil War of 1861, the depressive effect of which was in a
measure relieved by the Homestead Act of 1862. Toward the close
of the war public interest in land acquisition was renewed.

Taking into consideration the element of risk related to investing in undeveloped land, and the uncertainty as to the time necessary to realize upon such an investment, an investor in the Miami
tract in 18514 could have expected to pay approximately 8% for financing charges. (Trans. p. 231, Murray)

27. It is a matter of history that in 1820 when the Nation contained ll free states and 11 slave states both Maine’ and Missouri applied for admission to the Union. terested in maintaining a balance of power in the Senate," the south insisted the Federal Government was unable to prohibit slavery in any state. In the resultant
compromise, Maine was admitted as a free state, mssouri as a slaveholding state, and it was agreed that all states admitted thereaf er

which were north of the line 36° 30' should be free states. Nevertheless, when the Eebraska-Kansas Territorial Bill was introduced in

6 539Juary, 1854, it incorporated the principle of squatters sovereignty,
i.e., slavery within that territory was to be determined by its settlers.

Both the pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups were anxious to control this new area, and the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company, later
the New England Emigrant Aid Company; was organized for the purpose of

establishing claims to Kansas land by anti-slavery believers. Later

southern organizations of like nature were formed to advance the slavery views and both factions pushed for early settlement and control of
Kansas. However, the Territorial Act gave no protection to slave owners moving into Kansas who faced the menacing possibility of serious
property loss should the state ultimately decide against slaveny. Fur“armore, this was predominately a.prairie state and not well-suited to

slave labor. These were real deterrents, especially to Missouri which
‘was anxious to surround itself with slave-holding states, while the proximity of Missouri and easy access to Kansas by its citizens was also a
deterrent to those opposed to slavery and anxious to remove from its vicinity. Also,:much public land remained for sale in states where slavery was a settled issue.

A prospective purchaser of the Miami tract would have given consideration to these factors and would probably have concluded that they
so far offset each other as tozemove the issue of slavery as an influencing factor in the rapidity with which Kansas could be expected to be
That Kansettled, and the resultant demand for land within that state.

sas would become the scene of bloody strife and deadly antagonism between

6 5&0

the pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups, with both sides sending preemptors or squatters into Kansas andpengaging in armed conflict, would
not have been within the reasonable contemplation of a purchaser in 1851:».
This conflict, from which Kansas derived her name "Bloody Kansas, " contributed greatly to early settlement in the state but was under control
by November, l856, shortly before the sale of several tracts of Indian
trust lands which will be hereinafter referred to. (Def. Ex. 13, Dkt.
25l; House Ex. Doc. l3, 31:» Cong. lst Sess.)

28. By the fall of 1857 there were 35 free-state townsites alone
in Kansas. (Pet. Ex. 15?, Dkt. 251) In 1855 Ossawatomi was settled in
Linn county, Moneka was settled in Miami county in l856. By 1859 the
towns of Lawrence with a population of 3,500, Lecompton which was the
Territorial capital, Tecumseh and Topeka were located on the Kansas river, with Burlingame to the south along the Santa Fe trail, Brownsville
in Shawnee County and Emporia was established in Lyon county.

29. Defendant produced two witnesses, Richard B. Hall and Dr.
='illiam G. Murray, both qualified appraisers, who valued the Miami
tract as of June 5, 18511,, at 35¢ and 50¢ per acre, respectively. Both
had recently examined that land and an adjoining 350,000-acre tract in
Missouri, had studied soil data, maps, descriptive material, historic
and economical data applicable to the region, and the surveyors’ notes
concerning the areas made during the original surveys in 1856 and l857.

Mr. Hall thought that a prospective purchaser in 185% would have
considered the Miami tract isolated by the Peoria reservation to the

north and the Miami selections which were to be within the territory

ut their habitations; that road service was the Fort Leavenworth Fort Scott military road running through the eastern edge of both reservations, with the Santa Fe trail passing some l5 miles northwest of the
Peoria land, over 40 miles northwest of the Miami tract; that there were
no railroads in neither tract nor were any expected; that a general low
price level prevailed with money scarce and a l0% investment return not
unreasonable; that a purchaser would need pay taxes, conduct a sales promotional program, promote railroad construction and internal improvements
by vast land grants, sell on installments, run surveys and construct roads;
that he would have competitive individual land grants to railroads and institutions as well as the public domain lands available at $1.25 per acre
or less under the Graduation Act, and military bounty warrants and scrip
available at discount prices.

Mr. Hall did not discuss the sale prices received for the compara- i
tive Missouri tract, but considered that only l0% of it was then sold and
much would be available under Graduation prices. Upon a mathematical reasoning that a purchaser would be entitled to 25% profit, would need give
away 25% for development and sales costs would also require 25%, he determined a purchaser would be willing to pay only 35¢ per acre for the

Eiami tract in 1854.

In comparing the Missouri tract and the Miami lands, Dr..Murray found

the soils, climate, precipitation and altitude were similar; that the Mis-souri land had a 35% timber coverage as compared to 40% coverage for the
Hiami tract; the soils were mostly first and second class; the climate was

favorable; a small acreage of fertile bottom land along the Osage river in

each tract was subject to flood; while an abundance of limestone and
coal were on both tracts it had no commercial value for want of transportation facilities; there were no railroads servicing either tract and
none were anticipated; water transportation was limited to flat boats or
rafts on the Osage river during occasional periods of high water; roads
were mere trails over which freighting was tedious, and timbered land ‘
with adjoining prairie was most in demand.

Dr. Murray considered that only 10% of the Missouri tract or 3u,877
acres sold between 1843 and 1846, and 1.4% of those were warrant sales;
that a sharp increase in land sales occurred in 1853-1854; that most of
the Missouri land fell under the Graduation Act of August h, l85h, when
286,000 acres were yet on the market, Dr. Murray considered that an investor would need pay 8% interest on borrowed capital, and a prospective
purchaser could afford to pay only 50¢ per acre for the Miami tract in
185%.

30. Exclusive of school sections and land otherwise disposed of,

297,115 acres within the comparative Missouri tract have the following

sales record:

Year Acres Sold Year Acres Sold
1854 Prior 6/5 34.877 1863 120

31. Neither of petitioners‘ expert witnesses placed a monetary

value upon the Miami land. Ida Fox, a research analyst, reviewed the
history of Kansas; Hohn Long, Assistant Professor of Geography and History at'Wabash College, Crawfordsville, Indiana, compared the Miami
tract to the Peoria cession of l85h, basing his comparison upon comments found in the notes of the original surveys conducted in 18561857, and a recent personal inspezction of the tracts. He stated the
survey notes classified the soil as first, second and third rate; he
considered first rate included bottom, terrace and upland having up to
two per cent slope, with alluvial and dark residual prairie soil, that
second rate included what is classified today as Classes II, III, and IV,
and third rate included present day soil classifications of Class V, VI,
and VII. He found l3.3% of the Miami tract was Class I and 65.7%'was

ass II, which would leave 21% as Class III; that the Peoria tract was
7.1»; Class I and 75.63% Class II.

Mr. Long did not consider Class III land good for cultivation. He
diS00uDted a 1949 Soil Conservation Service publication reference to
Linn County soil as acid and phosphorus, with a large percentage underlaid by a tight claypan which hinders penetration of water and plant
roots, saying there has been a decline of soil since 1854, that the
acid is slight and not bad for the small grain produced there. He referred to one John H. Gibson's statement that the soils are capable of
producing hemp, maize, wheat and all small grains, vegetables or fruits

common to temperate regions.

32. Petitioners rely upon the appraisals and sales in 1856 and l857

of Peoria, Delaware and Iowa trust lands to establish an l854 value for
the Miami cession. These three tracts of Kansas land.which were ceded
in trust during 1850, were directed, appraised and sold in such manner
as the President deemed proper but for not less than $1.25 per acre or
less than the appraised value. (100 Stat. 700) The appraisers who were
appointed on April l6, l856, were directed to fix no value for any land
they considered worth less than $1.25 per acre. They were to take into
consideration the eligibility and quality of the land, the proximity of
‘water courses, roads, timber and other advantages, including improvements upon adjacent lands other than trust land within Kansas, but to
give no consideration to any improvements upon the land being appraised.
Values were set upon each acre in the three tracts. (Pet. Ex. 52, Dkt. 251)

(a) The Delaware trust land was located in Jefferson and Lea'venworth counties, approximately 50 miles north of the Miami reservation.
It contained over 500,000 acres, bounded on the east by the Missouri river. The Kansas river bordered it for some 15 miles along the southwest.
(Pet. Ex. 243, Dkt. 251) Appraiser James Relfe expressed an opinion that
the average price of $2.00 per acre received for land within a certain
range when sold.during November and December, 1856, would have been.much
higher if pre-emptors had not been permitted to acquire the.choice tracts
at appraised values. Quarter sections within 15 to 20 miles of Leaven‘worth acquired by pre-emptors, were shortly resold at profits of from
$1.25 to $3.12 per acre. (Pet. Ex. 71, Dkt. 251)

(b) The Iowa trust land of approximately 78,000 acreS'was

divided by the Kansas-Nebraska state line, more than 100 miles north



of the Miami tract. At the

sales held during June, 1857, all but a few tracts were sold in less
than two weeks for an average of $2.35 per acre. Before the close of
the sale, 290 of the 687 tracts had been transferred by the purchasers.
(Pet. Exs. 243, 93, Dkt. 251)

(c) The Peoria trust lands were appraised at from $1.25 to
$2.00 per acre and later increased an even 25¢ per acre to an average
of $1.66 per acre for the 208,585.69 acres. (Pet. Exs. 78, 80, 82,
198. Dkt. 251) All but 700 acres were sold between June 25th and July
lbth, 1857, for an average of $1.67 per acre. (Pet. Exs. 99, 120, Dkt.
251) Special Commissioner Stevens who conducted the sale, reported that
nearly every piece was claimed by a settler, but those tracts not so taken generally brought $3.00 per acre. (Pet. Ex. 94, Dkt. 251)

. 33- Only the Peoria trust land has been compared with the Miami
tract. The soil in the two tracts is lower Pennsylvanian, lower Permian
or upper Mississippian. Parent materials for residual soils are shales,
limestones and sandstones. The Kansas State Board of Agriculture in
"Soil Conservation in Kansas" in 1946 reported both tracts laid in the
East Prairies and Interspersed'Woodland Region; that the Peoria trust
lands and the northern third of the Miami lands are within the sub-division "East Central Prairies Section," which is characterized by gentxy
sloping to moderately rolling uplands, with rock outcroppings on occassional low hills, on the breaks and steep slopes along drainage ways.

average elevation is 1,200 to l,25O feet. average rainfall is 35 to 39

inches. average growing season is l8O to l9O days and average tempera6 5:5 ~‘

'“re is 55° to 57°.

The southern two—thirds of the Miami tract lies in the Southeastern Prairies Section, and is approximately lOO feet lower in elevation
and has a more level topography. It averages a precipitation of 3? to
#5 inches, a growing season of 190 to l95 days and an average temperature of 56° to 57%°. Summers are long, hot and dry. ‘winters are moderate. There are wide extremes in rainfall, vaying from drought to flood.

The Marais des Cygnes (Osage) river drains both tracts. Drainage
is generally southerly and southeasterly. Frequent floods along the
Osage river proper affect a relatively small but very fertile area.

‘Walnut, hickory, sugar maple, elm and other hardwoods grow on the
uplands, with sycamore and willow along the streams. According to the
1856-? survey notes, the Miami tract had 15% timber coverage outside of
reserved lands, and the Peoria tract had but 9% coverage. (Trans.
p. 131, John Long) Iron ore and coal were noted for each tract, withan abundance of limestone, especially in the southeast quarter of the
IMiami tract. Tar springs were mentioned, suggesting the presence of
petroleum but attracted no attention since there was no demand for it.
‘While advantageous for construction of pioneer homes and fencing, it is
not indicated that limestone or timber in 1854 possessed a present or
potential commercial value apart from the land, nor is there evidence
of mineral value within either tract.

None of the benefits of civilization such as schools, churches,

telephone or telegraph.services were available within either tract.

Beginning with the Act of'August 3, 185k, large sums of money were pro6 5&7 at

vided for laying out and construction of post roads in Kansas, but in

June of that year transportation in the Peoria and Hiami reservations
‘was limited to a dirt trail from western Missouri to the Miami villages,
and to the Fort Leavenworth - Fort Scott military dirt road which crossed the extreme eastern ends of both reservations. The Santa Fe trail

passed northwest of the Peoria tract. ‘Water transportation'was limited

to the Osage river during high states. The railroad terminated at Alton,

Illinois, north of St. Louis. A railroad track between Hannibal and St.

Joseph, Missouri, was under construction but no immediate prospect of a
railroad in or near the Miami or Peoria tracts existed.

For want of

transportation, the best potential use for either tract in 1854 was subsistence pnrpose farming.
34. Horace Greeley commented the Kansas timber was fit only for

fuel and fencing (Pet. Ex. 14?, Dkt. 251), that limestone had better potentialities for construction. A Mr. Lovejoy, writing from Palmyra, Kansas, on March 16, 1858, said timber was plentiful but high priced at $30
per thousand; that pine brought to Kansas City by way of the Missouri
river sold at $60. a thousand; that much construction was of stone or
concrete in preference to timber, with houses costing from $800 to
$2,000, but some dwellings were built for as little as $150 or $200;

that house rent varied from $12 to $50 per month, and that most towns
donated a lot if a dwelling'was to be erected upon it. (Pet. Ex. 154,
Dkt. 2.51)

Freight via the Missouri river from St. Louis to Westport (Kansas

City) was from $1.00 to $1.50 per hundred weight. (Pet. Ex. 131, Dkt. 251)

During l85b the Commissioner of Indian Affairs approved the
sale by Deleware Indians of 2,571 acres of well timbered land within an

area where timber was scarce, to the Christian Indians at $2.50 per acre,

which he considered "a mere nominal sun.“ In March. 1857. the Christian

Indians disposed of the tract for an average of almost $17.00 per acre.
The land was bisected by the chief commercial route into the interior of
Kansas and was within two miles of Leavenworth which had long been the
most rapidly growing community in Kansas, where a ready market existed
for farm produce.

(Pet. Exs. 52, 1&0, 103-106, Dkt. 251)
36.

From 1785 to 1870 the average cost to the Government of surveying public land was .0325¢ per acre, the average cost of selling such
land was .O29¢ per acre, or a total per acre cost of .062¢.

37. It was reported in l857 that claims to timbered land near Sugar Hound in the area of the Miami tract drained by Sugar Creek were valued at $5.00 to $7.50 per acre. Squatters' claims in the Osage river valley were valued in 1858 at $1.25 to $3.12 per acre for prairie land and
$1.87 to $6.25 for timbered land.

(Pet. Ex. 138, 1&2, Dkt. 251)

The Commission takes judicial notice of its decision in Dockets 15-5 and 71-3. 4 I.C.C. #10, wherein the fair market value on June
5-17. 1945 of a 909,565.62 acre tract known as the Osage reservation and
adjacent to the Miami tract on the west, was found to be 65¢ per acre.

A special study of 733,621.40 acres of that land disclosed it was surveyed in 1856 and 54% was pre-empted when the first public sales were
held in 1859. Through 1860 an additional 168,291.95 acres or 22% sold.

Sales from l85l (2l,7l4.69 acres), honesteads after l862 (26,l8l.6O acres)

state school selections (74,828.7b acres) and railroad selections
(53,230.85 acres) made up the balance. Practically all cash sales
were for $1.25 per acre, some were paid for with scrip issued under
the Agricultural and Mechanical College Act of July 2, 1862, 12 Stat.
503. The tract was within the 20—mi1e limit of two railroads to be
constructed nearby, and one track passed through it. (12 Stat. 772;
lb Stat. 236; Royce 266, Kansas Map 2)L

(a) Land of the Sac and Fox, within forty-five miles north
and west of the Miami tract, was appraised in 186% at a weighted average of $1.29 per acre, and most of it sold under sealed bids for an
average $1.05 per acre in 1865-6. 68,292.29 acres sold in 1859 for an
average of 85¢ per acre. (Royce 419, 454. Kansas 2)

i (b) 4,000 acres of the Chippewa—Eunsee trust land, within
25 miles of the Miami tract, were appraised in 1865 at values ranging
from $1.25 per acre for third class land to $2.00 per acre for first
class land. 1,113.37 acres sold in 1866 at an average of $2.01 per
acre and 2,687.9h acres sold in 1871 at an average of $h.4h per acre.
All these lands were within the ten mile limit of the Leavenworth; Lawrence and Galveston Railroad. (Royce #18, Kansas 2)

(C) 30,137.56 acres of Ottawa trust land, within 25 miles of
the Miami tract were appraised in 1864 at from $1.25 to $5.00 for an
average of $2.00jper acre. Between May, 1864, and May. 1866, 22,377
acres sold at an average of $2.h0 per acre. This entire acreage was

within the ten mile limit.of the Leavenworth, Lawrence and Galveston

Railroad. (Royce 435, Kansas 2)

39. From the entire record before us, as well as those
facts of which the Commission takes judicial notice, and taking
into consideration all the elements and factors found in the
Osage Case (3 I.C.C. 231) proper for consideration, we conclude
that the land involved herein had a fair market value on June 5,
185b, of $1.25 per acre, or a total value of $317,697.93. It
is also concluded that $200,000 was not an unconscionable consideration under the facts and circumstances surrounding its
purchase on that date, and that petitioners are not entitled to
eeiier under. Section 2 (5) of the Indian Claims Commission Act.

The petitions in Dockets Nos. 251 and 12¢-A'will each be dismissed.
