Decided: December 31, l9S9
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS 92 FACT

Explanatory Statement

The petition in the instant case was filed by certain individual
Nez Perce Indians as representatives of the Nez Perce Tribe. The
claims which are being urged by petitioners herein result from alleged
damages suffered by the tribe due to the intrusion of white trespassers on the Nez Perce Reservation during the period l860—l867
following the discovery of rich placer mines in 1860 and while the
Nez Perce Tribe had the right of exclusive possession of said reservation lands.

Following a previous hearing in this case, the Commission made
findings of fact and rendered an opinion, with Chief Commissioner'Witt
concurring in part and disagreeing in part (3 Ind. Cl. Comm. 571), in
which the Commission held that the United States was liable in damages

for the land occupancy uses by whites of the Nez Perce Reser'ation

333133 the gold rust ard prior to the date the United States acquired

«he 18355, April 17, 1857, that might be proved by the Non Force Tribe.
The Commission further determined the defendant would be liable for the
value of whatever gold originating from the reser*etion petitioners might
prove was acquired by the United States through the mint or any of its
branches. After the rendition of said findings of fact and opinion,
petitioners filed a motion for leave to amend the petition to conform

to the evidence to make it clear that their original pleadings intended
to include gold mining uses of the reservation in addition to a claim

for gold taken from the reservation by trespassers which was later acquired by the United States.

On Karen 6, 1956, the Commission issued an

order allowing petitioners to so a .4d the petition, over defendant‘s

objections, by insertion of a paragraph numbered 22-h. A further hearing

is now been held to permit petitioners the opportunity to prove the value
of the uses of the reservation by whites and the amount of Hez Perce gold

which was acquired by defendant in its mint or its branches.
The Commission makes the following findings of fact which are supplementary to findings of fact 1 to l8, inclusive, hereinbefore made (3 Ind.

Cl. Comm. 571):

19. At the trial held herein on March 26, 27, 28 and 31, l958,
evidence was presented. to show (1) the value of the gold tatten off the
Nez Perce Reservation prior to April l7, 1867, (2) the cost of mining
this 801d, and (3) the royalty that would have been appropriate for the
Part? P0SSeSSing the land to_have l€T3Gd on the mining operation.

and member of the Council of the Geological Society of America, formerly
Head of the Department of Mining at the University of Utah and for the
past ten years a member of the firm of Shenon and Full, mining geologists,
with offices in Salt Lake City, Utah, and Mr. Roy F. Pull, the other member of the firm, formerly Professor of dining at the University of Utah,
prepared a report and testified on behalf of the petitioners. Mr. Sherwin
H. Barton, who has been in private practice in engineering since l9h8

and is now a member of the firm of Barton, Stoddard & Milhollin, consulting engineers, Boise, Idaho, Mr. Ernest Oberbillig, formerly an
Associate Professor of Mining at the University of Idaho, and Dr. Merle
William Wells, Associate Professor of History at Alliance College,
Pennsylvania, testified on behalf of the defendant and presented two
iappraisal reports for the defendant prepared by Barton, Stoddard1&
Milhollin, the first on the gold production on the Nez Perce Reservation,
the second on the royalties and gold production costs.

The experts for both parties concluded that a reasonable evaluation
of the amount of gold taken from the Nez Perce Reservation before April 17,
1867, could be made.
The experts for both parties, apparently independently, arrived

at the same method for evaluating the amount of gold produced during

the trespass period. ‘Each testified that, where the data was available,
the most satisfactory method was to estimate for each mining district

and each mining season (1) the average daily yield per miner, (2) the
average number of miners working per day, and (3) the number of days

worked in the season, and, by multiplying these three estimated factors,

obtain an estimated total gold production for the district and season.

A wealth o; cat; has b.un presented to the Commission concerning
_.

the subject mining camps. Luis gold mining was responsible for the

organization of Idaho Territory. The gold arouszd a great deal of

.intcrcst. Newspapers reported the day to day occurrences in the mining
districts. Generally, particular attention was had to the weather,

daily Yields per miner, mining population, wages, and in the Oregonian,
to gold shipments from the nines to Portland and from Portland to San
Francisco. Mining engineers and geologists have examined and mapped
_the old mining districts and have published their findings in official
.

reports. There are p=blished accounts of the reminiscences of olditimers concerning activities in the mining districts. Events in the
mining districts have oeen researched and chronicled by the historians.
Some data has been found in federal, state and county records, though
many of the early mining camp records have been lost.

the findings and conclusions of Shenon and Full are contained in
Volume I of Petitioners‘ Exhibit Yo. 739. .All the evidence supporting
their findings and conclusions are contained in ?olumes II, III and IV
of this Exhibit. Volume V of this Exhibit contains maps of each of the
mining districts within the Nez Perce reservation. The findings and conclusions of defendant's experts are contained in Defendant‘s Exhibits
Nos. b5 and b5-A.

Despite their concurrence in method and approach, the experts

differed rather widely in their conclusions. Petitioners’ experts

303

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 300

determined that the gold removed from the Reservation amounted to I
$25,913,611. Defendant's experts determined that the gold removed
amounted to $15,133,780.

21. The locations of placer mining within and neighboring the Nez
Perce Reservation have been shown on maps prepared by Shenon and Full.
All the placer mining is shown to have occurred in that half of the
Reservation that lay to the east of the Snake and Salmon Rivers, including the bars of those rivers. Commencing at the northwest part of
this eastern half of the reservation and moving clockwise the principal
mining locations are the following: Gnat Creek; Burnt Creek; Pierce
City located on Orofino Creek; the lowest part of the South Fork of the
Clearwater River; next, locations in the neighborhood of the upper part
of the South Fork of the Clearwater River, including Newsome, Clearwater
Station, Elk City, Orogrande, and Dixie; further to the south, Warren
and Burgdoff in the so-called'Warren Secesh District; Florence; French
Greek and'Whitebird.Creek, both tributary to the Salmon River on trails
leading into Florence; the Salmon River Bars and the Snake River Bars.
For purposes of evaluation, the Shenon and Full report grouped these
locations under seven headings: (1) The "hez Perce Hines” which included the Burnt Creek, Pierce City, Bald Mountain, and Moose Creek
locations, (2) the "South Fork Mines" which included Newsome, Clearwater Station, Elk City, and Orogrande, (3) the “Salmon River Mines“,
the early name for the Florence district, (b) the %arren~Secesh Area
including Warren and Eurgdoff, (5) Salmon River Bars, (6) Dixie District,

and (7) Other Districts which included Snake River Ears, the lower parts

mining locations diffe_ently in a few respects. The camp at Kewsome was
evaluated separate from Elk City; the camp at Burgdoff, called Millerfs
Camp, was evaluated separate from Uarrens, and among “Additional Idaho
County Gold Areas” were included a number of locations all placed by

Shenon and Pull in their "South Fork Mines” district. The Commission
in the following findings has adopted the arrangement of camps used in

the Shenon and Full report.

THE NEZ PEECE ElhaS

 

22. Early writings referred to the deposits of the Pierce City Oro Fino - Bald Mountain District as "The Nez Perce Mines.“ The location
of the district is shown on Plate 3, Volume V of Petitioners‘ Exhibit
339. Early mining activities took place chiefly on Oro Fine Creek and
its tributaries. Pierce City, the principal settlement, was situated
near the juncture of Oro Fino Creek and Canal Gulch. Cro Pine Creek
emptied into the Clearnater River about 25 miles west of Pierce City.
The elevation of the camp was about 3,000 feet. Near Pierce City the

.miners worked the gravels on the low benches along Oro Fine Creek. The

gravels in the flat valley bottom and the high terraces extending about

500 feet above the Creek were also worked. Altogether Oro Fine Creek

was washed for gold for a distance of l2 miles above and 10 miles below

Pierce. North of Pierce, ahodes Gulch, which comes down from the north

and joins main Oro Fine Creek a few miles above Pierce, was worked extensively. Canal Gulch northward from Pierce for several

‘J1

8 Ind. c1. Com. 300

miles in the direction of the North Fork of the Clearwater River, was
also worked extensively both along the valley bottom and on the higher

terraces. Below Pierce, Oro Fino Creek runs in a narrow canyon which

widens and then breaks off into two branches. As shown by location

notices and sales in the official mining records of the district, the

smaller ravines and hill placers were placered to a considerable extent
by the early miners. Three types of claims were exploited by the early

miners - creek, ravine and hill claims. To encourage continuous employment throughout the mining season, the mining code for the district

permitted a claimant to hold one claim.of each of the three types. In

this manner if water failed on claims of one t e o erations could be
9 3’? 5

started on claims of another type. Some of the deposits could be easily

worked. However, many claims were located along streams with insufficient

fall. Long ditches or flumes had to be built to bring the water to such

claims. In order to exploit such claims efficiently, the miners worked

\

in groups or formed small companies. The boundary of the reservation

established under the 1855 treaty runs through the eastern part of this
mining district. is with most of the placer mining districts, the first
year was the peak year, production decreasing thereafter. However, in

1865, when the Chinese were first allowed into the district, production
increased temporarily. During the last two years of the subject period

production declined again.

OTHER ESTIMATES ("NEZ PERCB MINES“)

 

2h. A number of estimates have been made of the placer gold production of the Pierce City, Orofino, Bald Mountain district. In a 1930
publication of the Idaho Bureau of Mines and Geology, Alfred L. Anderson
stated "that various estimates have placed the production of the Pierce
district from the placer deposits at from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000

with the latter figure probably more nearly correct. Most of this was
produced during the early boom period, and the production soon after
probably rarely exceeded $20,000 to $30,000 per annum." "Waldemar
Lindgren was the first to publish a scientific study of the district.
In 190h Lindgren estimated its production to have been "in the vicinity
of $S,000,000." In 1909, S. P. Jellum estimated its production at
“safely” above $50,000,000. A study made by Francis A. Thomson and
Samuel M. Ballard in 192h gave the production of Pierce City at
$10,000,000. Since Anderson wrote his summation, Stephen R. Capps
placed "the order of magnitude of the placer output" of the Pierce City
district at $11,000,000. Dr. Philip Stoddard Brown, who made an earlier
study for the petitioners in this case, placed the production of the
Pierce-Orofino district prior to April 1?, 1867, at $?,000,000.

BOU1\‘-DARY (111032 PERCE 1~:[:n:S==)

 

25. The location of the Nez Perce Reservation boundary cutting

across the eastern part of the Pierce City - Oro Fino mining district

308

was mapped by Shanon and Full as shown on Plate 3 in Pet. Ex. 739, Vol. V,

and was mapped by Barton, Stoddard & Milhollin as shown on Def. Ex. h3.
Shenon and Full, by measurements of the known placer streams in the
mining district, determined that 6,8hS claims could have been worked, of
Which h,2l8 would have been within the Reservation and 2,627 outside.
Hr. Shanon testified that, having regard to the time and concentration
of mining activity, a lineally computed ratio may reasonably be applied

to total production to determine the proportion removed from within the

Reservation. For this district, Shenon and Full used the lineally computed ratio as the best measure of this apportionment of the total production and accordingly considered that 61.6 per cent of the total

production of the district came from within the Reservation. The defendant's evaluations, by reference to their large scale map of the area,i%pnsidered that 80 per cent of the worked area lay within the Reservation

and used this 80 per cent to determine the part of the whole production
that came from within the area. The Shenon and Full evaluation report,

out of a total estimated production of $6,Sh3,000 for the whole district
during the subject period, attributed $h,O30,6ll to the Reservation;

the Barton, Stoddard &.Milhollin report, out of a total estimated production of $3,h00,000, attributed $2,720,000 to the Reservation.

SOUTH FORK MINES

 

26. Early writers referred to the Elk City, Orogrande, Newsome,

and Clearwater Station areas as the "South Fork Hines.“ The place

"3

grounds in these areas have been located by Shanon and Full on Plate L

of Volume V of Petitioners’ Exhibit 730. They occur along .59 south

 

1

Fork of the Clearwater iust below Newsome Creek and along the upper
tributaries of the South Fork, principally Red River, Red Horse Creek,
American Creek, Elk Creek, Crooked Creek, Moose Creek, Newsome Creek
and the tributaries to these streams. In most of these areas, hill
placers predominated. Due to the lack of water with which to exploit
these hill placers, the camps in most of these areas had to await the
construction of large ditches to convey water into the hills. Initial
production came largely from creek bottoms, and these bottoms could
only be worked during low water. Accordingly, unlike Pierce and later
Florence, the Elk City and neighboring mines did not experience an
immediate flush production period but instead developed more gradually,
reaching production peaks in later years. The Elk City area lay mostly
outside the Reservation boundary as found by this Commission. The DroErande area lay mostly inside the Reservation. The Neusome and Clearwater Station areas lay wholly inside the Reservation.

27. The Shenon and Full evaluation report for each of the years

1851. 1853, 186b, l86S, and 1866, has estimated the average number of
working miners throughout the season, the number of working days, and
the average yield per man—day and by multiplying these three factors

arrived at a total gold production for the year. The Shanon and Full

evaluation for the year 1862 was rested on (1) reports of new discoveries

made in the district that year, (2) the development of water for processing the hill placers, (3) the conclusion that total production in

lS62 exceeded considerably the production of the previous year, and

310

()1) the eviden:-e that C;-e.'.1.‘r::ith F.:»:press he’; Sh‘i‘ppr:;;?
out of Elk City before the end of 1862. Shenon and Full determined that
ordinarily in these mining camps not more than one half of the gold dust
produced was carried out by commercial carriers. Experts for both parties
agreed that all but a very small part of the gold dust shipped out of

Elk City eould have originated in the South Fork Mines. To the estimated
total production for the years 1861 through 1866, the Shenon and Full
evaluation added an estimated production for 1867 prior to April 17,

l867. The following tabulation summarizes the estimations made by

Shenon and Full of total reduction of the South Fork Nines prior to

The Barton, Stoddard &‘Nilhollin evaluation report encompassed the

“South Fork Eines" in three groups, Elk City, Newsome, and additional
Idaho County areas, for each of which separate estimates of gold production for each year were presented. Relying substantially on the
Galbraith Express shipments of $933,?L2 in gold dust out of Elk City

4..

in 1861 and 1862, the Barton, Stoddard & Hilhollin evaluation estimated

about $2 million shipped out of Elk City for the first two years. Of
this $2 million, $1,600,000 was attributed to production in the South
Fork Mines -— that is, $1,200,000 to Elk City; $350,000 to Neusome; and
$50,000 to additional Idaho counties. For the period 1863 through 1868,
the Barton, Stoddard & Hilhollin estimates of total production for these
three areas making up the South Fork Hines are strikingly close to the
Shenon and Full estimates for the years l86h and 1865 and are much lower
than the Shenon and Full estimates for the years 1863 and 1866. Shenon
and Full’s estimation resulted in finding these two years, years of
high production, whereas the Barton, Stoddard &.Milhollin estimates

made these two years, years of low production. The newspaper and other

reports bearing upon the mining population, the length of the mining
season, and the daily average yield per miner clearly do not reflect
that these were years of reduced production. The Barton, Stoddard &
Milhollin evaluation made no provision for any production for these

mines in 1867 prior to April 17, 1867. The following tabulation summarizes the Barton, Stoddard & Milhollin estimates of total gold production from the "South Fork Mines" prior to April 17, 1867:

OTHER E0TlMATES (“SOUTH roar KINES“)

28. Various early estimates have been made of the placer gold production of the Elk City district, exclusive of Neusone, Clearuater.Stati0n,
and Orograndc. The earliest such estimate, “$10,000,000 in coarse placer
gold”: was published by the Idaho Bureau of Immigration, Labor and

tatistics in its report for the year l90°~l90h. Lindgren in l90h published his estimate placing the production between S and l0 million
dollars. Arthur L. Flagg, a mining engineer, reported in 1913 that the
production of the Elk City district "is generally believed to be some:here in the neighborhood of $10,000,000.” In l92h Francis A. Thomson
and Samuel M. Ballard concluded that the Elk City region had produced
"$18,500,000 in placer gold besides that which the Chinese took out
and of which no record exists.“ In l93h Professor Staley, who testified

"jr the defendant, estimated that the early production of the Elk City

Tdistrict ranged from a total of S to l0 million dollars. The earliest

published estimates for the Newsome and Clearwater Station areas appear

in l9hl. That year Clyde Ross estimated production from the Newsome and
Clearwater areas at $2,000,000. The same year Stephen Capps placed "the

order of magnitude of the placer output"_fr0m the Elk City district at
$18,500,000 and from the Newsome district at $2,000,000. Dr. Philip

Stoddard Brown, in his study made earlier for the petitioners in this

case, estimated the production of the Elk City, Newsome, and Clearwater Station

areas prior to April 1?, 1867, at $9,250,000 and of the Orogrande area at

$350,000 prior to April 1?, 1867.

hare shown the Reservation boundary crossing a part of the Elk City
district on a larger scale map, In addition, Shenon and Full have
measured all streams in the “South Fork Mines" area known to have been
plaeered or to represent placer activity and have converted these lineal
measurements to claim units, The claim unit potential for the entire
"South Fork Mines" area cas shown to be 6,085 units, of which 3,120
units, or 51.3 percent were within the reservation. Of these 3,120
units within the reservation, l,h?2 were in the Newsome and Clearwater
Station areas, both which areas lay entirely within the reservation.
Of the h,6l3 claim units in the Elk City, Orogrande area, 1,6b8, or

mappings and measurements, and the reported distribution of mining
activity, the Shanon and Full evaluation distributed the annual estimated total production of the “South Fork Mines“ to mines within the

inside the Reservation. For the Elk City district, Barton, Stoddard &
Milhollin, by reference to maps and field investigations, attributed
15 per cent of their estimated production to mines inside the Reservation.
The Barton, Stoddard & Milhollin estimates encompassed within the “South

within the reservation line found by the Commission about 80 miles southsoutheast of Lewiston on the north side of the Salmon River near the
point where that river turns sharply from a westerly direction to a
northerly direction. The district is at an elevation of about 6,000
being on the plateau about three miles north of the edge of the

A

canyon cut by Salmon River. Early reports described it as "a marsh on

top of a mountain”, “a large basin surrounded by mountains." The mining
district extended about five by eight miles, gently rolling, with few
hills exceeding 300 feet. The area was drained chiefly by Sand Creek,
a branch of Meadow Creek, which latter empties into the Salmon River

southeast of Florence. Another part of the drainage, including Millers

Creek, flowed northward into Slate Creek and joined the Salmon northwest

of Florence. The placer gold was found in and along the courses of the

many small creeks, ravines, and gulches tributary to either Meadow or

Millers Creek. At some earlier time these tributary creeks had been 20

to 50 yards wide, with flat, gravelmfilled bottoms and a very slight

grade. At the time of the placer mining, these creeks were filled with

peat and muck to a depth of from two to 20 feet. Many had become

stagnant marshes. The gold was found in the gravel below the peat and

muck.

The Salmon River Mines were discovered in midaAugust, 1861. The

richness of the gravel was recognized at once. The news of the discovery
spread quickly and brought a rush of miners into the district. At first
the ground was worked with pan and rocker. The peat and muck was removed

with axe, spade, and shovel. ‘Water was had by digging holes in the ground

and letting the hole fill sufficiently for use of a pan or rocker, later

32. The earliest reported estimate of the production of the "Salmon
River Hines" is that of G. H. Atkinson, published in the Oregon Argus of
August 23, l862. Hr. Atkinson‘s estimate was made when the placer
mining was at its peak. He had the advantage of an inspection of the
mines in full operation and of data obtained from first-hand interrogation of the miners. He had the disadvantage of having to project by
estimation the amount of paying gravel still forthcoming and the number
of man days that would be consumed in taking that gravel out. His projections as to the expected life of the claims were soon shown to be
understatements. Mr. Atkinson explicitly did no include in his estimation any production from the hill claims nor from tailings which were

to be washed over with sluices and hydraulics. with these qualifications,

‘eMr. Atkinson estimated a total production of $l0,80h,98h. The earliest

estimate of total Florence production made after the gold had been taken
is that of the geologist Lindgren. His study of this district and
neighboring districts was published in l900. Lindgren estimated Florence
production "to be from $15,000,000 to $30,000,000." This estimate has_
since been continuously relied on in later studies of the district. In
192b, Francis A. Thomson and Samuel M. Ballard estimated Florence production to have been $22,500,000, the mean between the highland low range
points determined by Lindgren. In l9hl, two geologists in separate
studies, Stephen R. Capps and Clyde P. Ross, gave Florence production

at $22,500,000. In l9h5, Professor Staley adopted the high and low

range Of Lindgren. The studies agree that the great bulk of production

319

8 Ind. 01. Com. 300

was taken in the first few years. Dr. Brown, in his study made for the
petitioners in this case, determined that Florence production prior to
April 17, 1857, totaled $20,000,000.

drainage systems: that of warren or Meadow Creek, its tributaries, and
adjoining streams, that flow generally north and east to join the Salmon
River 10 to 15 miles north of‘warren, which was the principal settlement
in the area; and second, that of the Secesh River and its tributaries,
which river flows in a southeasterly direction to join the South Fork
of the Salmon River some 35 miles southeast of'warren. Burgdoff, lo-!

cated almost 12 miles west of‘Warren, was the largest settlement in the

latter western, or Secesh part, of the Warren—Secesh area. The topography of the placer districts in both parts of the area is very similar.

In both the placer gravel was found generally in creek bottoms, and on

terraces flanking the creeks, usually buried under several feet of peat

and muck similar to that at Florence. The depth of the gravel varied,

but rarely exceeded 18 feet. t was extensive but not, in most places,

extremely rich. Spectacular discoveries, similar to those at Florence,
were uncommon and mostly miners satisfied with a modest gain frequented
the area. The first discoveries were made in the spring or summer of

1862.

The Barton, Stoddard & Milhollin evaluation treated the'Warren and

in gold production for the years 1862 through 1866.% Accordingly, in

the estimation of the defendant‘s experts, all but a very small fraction
of the production of the Warren-Secesh area was derived from the'Earren
district.

For the Warren’s district, the Barton, Stoddard & Milhollin evaluation

determined for each year the average number of working miners and the

number of working days and, by multiplying these two factors, obtained
for each year the number of man shifts, or man days worked. The total
man shifts worked for the four-year period was then multiplied by an
estimated average daily yield per man for the four~year period. The

35. Lindgren, after visiting the‘warren’s district in 1897, wrote
shortly before 1900 that the total production of the warren‘s district
"to date % % % certainly must exceed $15,000,000.“ In 1937, Reed, using
Lindgren's estimate as a base, determined that the district produced
$17,000,000 through 1935. Of this production, Reed stated “the bulk

of the production came from the rich stream and hillside placors within

half a dozen years of the district’s discovery.“ The estimates of

¢;d,000,000 and of Professor Staley made in 1935

first obtained by Lirdrren, None of these estimates included the

of the Secesh Basin district, Capps wrote that “a compilation and evaluation of estimates made by a number of men who have long been familiar
with activities in this area place the value of the placer gold output
in the years 1862 to 1900 at $326,000." Dr. Brown, in his evaluation
presented earlier in this case for the petitioners, attributed to the

combined Warren's and Burgdorf districts a total production prior to
April 1?, 1567, of $7,000,000, of which Dr. Brown estimated that
$1,500,000 had come from the Burgdorf, or Secesh district.

By_the measurement of the streams that were considered to

represent placered areas during the reservation period, Shenon and Full

computed separately for both the Warren's district and the Secesh district

the claim potential inside and outside the reservation. By these measurements, Shanon and Full determined that 33.7 precent, or approximately onethird, of the production ground in the combined Warren-Secesh area was
within the reservation. These same computations established that 32.6
percent, or slightly less than onemthird, of the production ground in

the Warren's district alone was within the reservation, and that 37.6

percent, or slightly more than one-third, of the production ground in

the Secesh district alone was within the reservation. H never, because
placered areas were not worked at the same time, and because their richr““s differed, the e n:asurement guides were applied by Sncnon and Full

"SALMON RIVER BARS”

37.

Gold bearing gravels have been found along the Salmon River at
intervals from the South Fork down to the Snake. During the Reservation
period, this entire area was inside the Reservation. From French Creek

down, this area is now included in three mining districts, the French

Greek district that extends from French Greek to Lucille, the Lucilleilsampson district that extends from Lucille to Freedom, and the Camp

Howard district that extends from Freedom to the Snake. The gold bearing

gravels occur on the bars along the River and on benches on either side

of the River. These benches occur at several levels, some as high as

h00 feet above the present stream. The gold bearing gravels on the bars

were discovered and worked earliest. These were shallow deposits confined to a few inches of the surface. Before the Reservation period
ended, some of the higher bench gravels that afforded deeper diggings
were being worked.

The climate on the bars and benches from Riggins to

Whitebird, where the most productive placers were found, was mild during

Lo

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 300

round mining operations, As in most placer mining areas, the greatest

roduction occurred in the early years following the first discoveries.

EXPERTS’ EVALUATIONS (”SALKON RIVER BARS”)

38. The Shenon and Full evaluation of the production of the Salmon
River bars for the Reservation period was rested upon (l) their estimate
of the average number of miners that worked the River throughout the
entire five-year period, (2) their estimate of the total number of days
worked during the entire period, and (3) their estimate of the daily
average yield per miner for the entire period. Shenon and Full determined that an average of 300 miners were employed on the Salmon River
throughout the five-year period, that on an average 300 days were worked
each year, and that the average daily yield per miner was $7. These
estimates resulted in an evaluation of the total production of the Salmon
River bars for the Reservation period at $3,150,000 (300 men x 300 days x
5 years x $7).

The Barton, Stoddard &.Milhollin evaluation of the production of
the Salmon River bars for the Reservation period was arrived at by estimating separately the production for each year. The Barton, Stoddard &
Milhollin estimates were as follows:

1862 - $225,000
1863 - 125,000

186a ~ 100,000
1865 - 75,000
1866 - 50,000

.Accordingly, the Barton, Stoddard & Milhollin evaluation of total

production from the Salmon River bars during the Reservation period

was $575,000.

326

39. Thomson and Ballard in l92h placed the total production of the
Salmon River bars at something less than $2,500,000. In l938, Lorain
and Metzger, without estimating total production, determined that the
greatest production was obtained in the early years following the first

-_

discoveries. In l9hS, Mr. Walter Hovey Hill, a mining engineer with
fifty years’ experience in the area, stated the production of the placers
along the Salmon River from Riggins to whitebird at $10,000,000. Dr.
Brown, testifying for the petitioners in an earlier phase of this case,
evaluated the production of the Salmon River bars at $750,000.

"DIXIE DISTRICT“

 

L0. The present town of Dixie is located about 30 miles south of

Elk City and about one-half mile east of the east boundary of the Reser~
gation. The early placer mining was done principally on tributaries of
Crooked Creek a few miles north and south of Dixie. Most of this mining
area is outside the Reservation. little is known of the early history

of the Dixie district. No newspaper accounts or other reports made

during the Reservation period have been found to make any specific
reference to the mines in the Dixie district. The evaluation of production from this district prior to April 1?, 186?, has been based for
the most part on the reports of geologists and mining engineers who later

reconnoitered the district.

EVALUATION DATA (“DIXIE DISTRICT“)

    

hl. In 1909, Jellun wrote that the records of the express company

that handled much of the gold shiyped from Dixie showed that between

8 Ind. Cl. Com. 300

June, 1861, and August, 1863, gold in the value of $270,500 was handled
by the company. Two years later, in 1911, Judge Henry Haalitt, a Dixie
pioneer, described how the Dixie district was first discovered and by
‘whom and set the discovery date in August, 1862. In 192b, Thomson and
Ballard estimated the total production of the Dixie District, including
production from lode mines worked years after the Reservation period,

at $1,500,000. Lorain and Metzger were next to report on the Dixie district. Their report, based upon a reconnaissance of the area, was published in 1938 and stated that the volume of placer gravel in the Dixie
district was small as compared with other important districts in central
Idaho and that it was difficult to understand from where in the district
production as high as $1,500,000 would have come. Lorain and Metzger
reported that the very early years, 1861 to 1863, were undoubtedly the
years of greatest production, and that, in the light of Jellum's reported express company figures, the total production of the district
‘was undoubtedly considerably less than $1,000,000. The next year, 1939,
Capps published his report on the Dixie district. Capps placed the first
discovery in the district in August, l86h, and stated that mining was
carried on vigorously for the next few years. Capps estimated that the
$1,500,000 total production figure estimated by Thomson and Ballard contained from $150,000 to $700,000 of gold produced from lodes. Capps
identified the principal activity in the early years to have occurred on
Nugget, Dixie, Upper Fourth of July, and Olive Creeks, most of which

mining areas has been shown to have been outside the Reservation.

of eyewitnesses, historians and in various district records. Their
production, however, was overshadowed by the very much iarger production
of other mining districts not far distant. Information about them is
extremely limited. The Shenon and Full evaluation report estimated the
combined production of these areas prior to April l7, l867, to be in
excess of $500,000. However, in view of the lack of supporting evaluation
data, the Shenon and Full evaluation attributed $500,000 to production from
these other districts, all within the Reservation. The Barton, Stoddard

Stoddard &.Milhollin on the other to estimate the net profit on gold
produced on the Reservation were substantially different. Shenon and

Full determined that the total production cost would be reasonably

reflected by allowing for each man—day worked directly on mining claims,
both in opening and producing from the claims, ; cost measured either

by the wages reported paid to miners in the camp it the time or a cost
measured by a standard maximum wage of $5 per d'y. Using this method,
Shenon and Full computed a net profit on gold p ciuced on the Reservation
that amounted to about 55 percent of the dollar value of the gold, when
actual reported wages were used in the compute ion, and about 65 percent
of the dollar value of the gold when the standard maximum wage was used
in the computation. Barton, Stoddard and Mil3ollin determined that the
total cost of production would be reasonably represented by allowing for
each man-day worked in mining claims a cost that would include, in addition to the wage reported paid to miners in the camp at the time, other
cost components intended to measure the cost of travel from Portland to
and from.the mines, the cost of exploring and developing claims, the
cost of tools and equipment, the cost of food and housing, the cost of
water, spring preparations, sluices, and quicksilver, the cost of shipping
and marketing the gold, the cost of taxes. By this method, Barton,
Stoddard &.Milhollin arrived at an estimated net value of the gold produced on the Reservation that rut sted to 12 percent of the dollar value
of the gold.

b6. Shenon and Full has stated certain premises that underlay

their method for estimating the net profit on the gold produced on the

'\f Shenon and Full considered that an element of profit searing, or incentive bonus payment, was included in these high wages; and that it
was this element, in addition to the remoteness and rigorous life of
the mining camps, that contributed to make these wages several times’
higher than wages paid in other mining industries at the time. Shenon
and Full considered that much of the gold was produced by small groups
of individual miners working claims with costs limited to their living
expenses and a few simple tools, a pick, shovel, axe, and pan. Shenon
and Full considered that, to the extent that other trespassers upon the
Reservation exploited other resources, water, timber, ferries, townsites,
farmlands, for a profit and reaped that profit off the miners, that that
profit should not be made a charge against the net value of the gold produced on the Reservation. Shenon and Full considered that the high prices

for food and equipment that were reported during certain periods in some
of the camps were of short duration, reflected extreme shortages when
little was bought or sold, and accordingly had little effect upon production costs in the aggregate or on the cost of living of many miners.
Shenon and Full considered that, had an operating agreement existed for
the mining of the Reservation gold, the gold would have been produced in
a more organized manner, with greater efficiency and greater net profit.
These factors considered, Shanon and Full estimated the cost of production
and net value of gold produced on the Reservation by determining for

each year and each mining area (1) the man-days worked on claims within

0

the Reservation and (2) the average reported wage per man-day. Using

these two factors, production cost was computed by year for each mining

which the average reported wage exceeded $5, the an—days worked was
mu tiplicd by $5, selected as a standard maximum wage. This method
was used for each mining area for which a production estimate was made
except for Salmon River Bars, Dixie and “Other Districts.“ For these
areas, Shenon and Full estimated production cost to be onc—half the
dollar value of the gold. Shenon and Full estimated the net profit on
the production of gold from the Reservation to be, on the basis of reported wages, $lh,6S8,637, and, on the basis of a standard $5 maximum
wage, $l6,89S,2lh.

h7. Barton, Stoddard & Hilhollin presented a study of mining and

other costs in the Pierce and Florence mining districts. They applied

,the results of this study to estimate the net profit on gold produced

in these districts and on the balance of the Reservation. The estimates
mady by Barton, Stoddard & Milhollin of the average reported wages in
these districts were substantially the same as made by Shenon and Full.
Also, Barton, toddard &.Milhollin, to estimate production cost, charged
the average reported wage against each man-day worked on the mining claims
as was done by Shenon and Full. However, Barton, Stoddard & Milhollin
considered that this charge would account for only a part of the total
production cost. They estimated a number of additional cost components,
each of which they then charged in like manner against each man-day‘s
work. For the Pierce mining district for the year 1861, for example,

they estimated the total production cost per man—day to be as follows:

Food and lodging $0-9
Wages 5.00
Travel costs 1.15
Tools .35
Opening the claim 1.57
Sluice boxes .12
Quicksilver .18
Total Cost per Man—day $9.27

For 1861 and 1862 in Florence, they estimated a fixed per man—day cost

and also a fluctuating "board and room“ per man—day cost. The fixed

cost was estimated to be:

Wages $7»57
Travel .97
Tools _.3S
Marketing .6?

Total Fixed Cost per

The “board and room" cost was estimated to range from a high in March
1862 of $12.30 per man-day to a low in September 1862 of $1.61 per manday. By applying these per man-day costs to each man-day worked, for
Pierce these computations gave an estimated total production cost of
$3,0S7,09h on a total production of $3,h00,000, leaving a net profit
of $3h2,906; for Florence a total production cost of $9,209,598 on a
total production of $10,660,825, leaving a net profit of $1,hS1,227.
The net profit at Pierce was shown by these estimates to equal 10.1

determinations, Barton, toddard &,Milhol1in estimated that the net

profit on the total gold produced on the Reservation was 12 percent of

the dollar value of the gold, based upon $l3,308,S20.00 as the cost of

production of their estimated $lS,133,780.00 worth of gold produced.

Eat Perce tract, the costs of labor and living expenses were high.

This was due to the remoteness of the region, the high cost of transportation and the fact that the Civil'Har was in progress. In addition

to wages paid the miners which were in fact a large part of the cost of
mining the gold, there were other expenses which should be considered

in determining the total cost of production such as exploration, development and miscellaneous operating expenses. Many claims required considerable expenditures to be made in opening them for operation. Sluices,
flumes and dams had to be built and the surface stripped to get to pay
dirt. Shelter was required for the miners on the claims. ‘Water ditches

had to be constructed sometimes over long distances at considerable cost.

‘While a mining lease of the reservation for mining and related uses would

jermit the operator, or operators, to make use of the timber and water

on the reservation there would be the expense of hiring carpenters, or
laborers, to construct the ditches, flumes, sluices and shelters and the
necessity of supplying them with tools and materials. The operator, or

operators,of the lease would have to meet the marketing costs, that is in

h9. The land owners‘ share in the development of mineral lands
is usually determined by a percentage of the net or gross profit and
is set forth in a royalty agreement made between said owner and the
mine operator. The record contains no evidence of a royalty agreement
which would be comparable to the leasing of a large mining area such
as involved in this case. The evidence with respect to royalty agreements cover only the leasing of small claims. Only one royalty agreement dated in l869 was introduced involving mining claims on the
reservation. This involved three small mining claims in the Florence
district and provided that the owners of the claims receive “one-half
of the net proceeds, weekly." Two royalty agreements covering small
placer claims in California in l8S? and 1860 were introduced in evidence.
One provided the land owner receive one-half of the net proceeds and the
other provided that the operator was to defray all expenses and the land
owner was to receive "one-fourth of the amount of gold taken therefrom.”
In view of the fact that a lease of the reservation for mining and related purposes would allow the mining operator, or operators, to remove
the gold; to use the water on the lands and cut the timber; to operate
ferries; to build roads; and to establish supply depots at townsites,
among other things, the Commission finds that a royalty of fifty percent of the net profit of the gold removed from the reservation would
have been a fair and resonable arrangement between the Nez Perce Tribe
and the mining operator, or operators.

S0. The Commission, based on the findings of fact herein made

and the record as a whole, finds that the Nez Perce Tribe is entitled
