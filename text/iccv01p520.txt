__ . . ..

I_L._g The Claim here asserted by the petitioners, the Kiowa, Comanche,
—and Apache Tribes of Indians, is to reccventhe sun: of $16,268,661! less
$2,000,000 paid by the Government, for 2,033,583 acres of land lying

- west of the 9éth Meridian in what is now the State of Oklahoma, which
land is part of an area of 2,966,893 acres situated in a larger territory historically known as the Leased District.

2. The lands involved in this case were acquired by the petitioners under the Treaty of October 21, 1867, 15 Stat, 581. By this

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 505 - 521

._2_

treaty the lands hereinafter described were ceded by_the United,
States to the Confederated Tribes of Kiowa and Comanche Indians;

that the lands so ceded are located. in the State of Oklahoma and

are described in the treaty as follows:

__ “commencing at a point where the Washita River
crosses the 98th meridian, west from Greenwich; thence
yup the Washita River, in the middle of ‘the main channel thereof, to a point thirty miles, by river, west
of Fort Cobb, as now established; thence, due west to
the_'north;fork of Red River, provided said line strikes
said river east of the one hundredth meridian of west
longitude; if not, then only to said meridian-line, andthence south, on said meridian-line, to the said north
fork of Red River; thence down said north fork, in the
middle of the main channel thereof, from the point
where it may be first intersected by the lines above
described, to the main Red River; thence down said river, in the middle of the main channel thereof to its
intersection with the ninety-ei_ghth meri dirm of Toneda—-: — -— gym--— wcu -—-Dru-re‘)--p

tude ’west from Greenwich; thence north, on said meridian  line, to the place of beginning, *,* *.“ (FindingiNo. 1)

Subsequent to said cession, and on the same day-that said treaty
was executed, the said Apache Tribe of Indians united with the
Kiowa and Comanche Tribes, and thereafter shared and enjoyed
Jointly with the Kiowa and Comanche Tribes all the above--described
land  the benefits arising from said treaty. See treatybetween
the'_ United States and the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Tribes of
Indians, dated October 21, 1867, and ratified July 25, 1868, 15
Stats 589. Said treaty with the Kiowa and Comanche is historically known as the Medicine Lodge Treaty.

3. Pursuant to section in of the Act of March 2, 1889, 25

Stat. 980, the President of the Uni ted States appointed a Commis1 Ind. Cl. Comm. 505 7 _ - 522
sion, composed-of De:vid_H. Jerome, Chairman, Warren G. Sayre and
Alfred M. Wilson, to negotiatean agreement with peti_tioners for the
cession of theirlands in the coded area, and said Commissioner on
the 6th day. of October, l892 (this date is sometimes referred to as
the 21st day of October, 1892), concluded an agreement by which the
petitioners ceded all of their lands described in paragraph 2 hereof,
to the United States, and the United States agreed to allot to each
member of the petitioner tribes, over the age of 18 years, 160 acres
of the lands ceded, and the members of said tribes were also allowed
to select a like area for each of his or her children under the age

of 18 years. A copy of said agreement so negotiated and concluded

historically .‘a':no'“'n as the
Jerome Agreement, and will be so referred to hereafter, or as “the
agreement.“

The agreement contained an express provision that it should be- _

come effective only when ratified by the Congress of the United States.

15:. On the 22d day of October, l892,_ the Commissioners who negotiated the Jerome Agreement transmitted the same to the President. In
due time the President reporteisaid agreement to the Congress; however, Congess tool: no action thereon until it passed the Act of

June 6, 1900, 31 Stat, 677. A copy of said Act, insofar as it applies
to the matter here under consideration, is set forth in Finding No. 3
hereof, being Section 6 of said Act; that by said not the Congress did

not ratify the Jerome Agreement in the form in which it was negotiated

1 Ind’. Cl. Comm. 505 hr _523

and sufmitted to 11-, by the President,_ but made substantial changes

therein, which will be hereinafter referred to.

5. After the passage of said Act of June 6, 1900, purporting to
ratify the Jerome Agreement, the ‘so-called ratified agreement was not

submitted to_ the petitioners for their_consideration and approval of

the changes made by congress in said not of 1900, nor was said Act,

as passed by Congress, ever submitted to petitioners for their consideration or approval, nor have petitioners ever approved the same,

although the $2,000,000 provided for in Article VI of the agreement
appearing in said Act of 1900 was eventually paid as required. by the

provisions of said Article. (Finding No. 1t).

6. As required by the Act of June 6, 1900, the defendant made iné
dividual allotments to the members of the three tribes in the aggregate
amount of 3435.000 acres and set apart 3480.000 acres of pasture land» for
the ccmmon use of said Indians; however, 100,000 acres of this pasture.
land was later allotted to individual members of said tribes. The defendant also set apart for agency, school,'religious, and other purposes, 10,310 acres. So there remained the 2,033,583 acres which the

defendant received under the Act and which is the land involved in this
claim. (see Finding No. it).

7. Let us now compare the provisions of the Jerome Agreement,

which was executed by the treaty Commissioners and the Indians in 1892,

with the provisions of the Act of 1900. In the Act of June 6, 1900,

l Ind. Cl. Comm. 505 5 _ 2 524

31 Stat. 677, which purports to ratify the Jerome Jgreemenhbwe find
‘in Article I that the cession of thew_2,968,893 acres was subject to
the allotments te the individual Indians and subject to setting apart
as grazing 1ands_for said Indians 1-380,000 acres of land for grazing
purposes. No mention of the reserve for grazing purposes wasmade in
p the Jerome Agreement, and in Article III of the so-called ratified
agreement provision is made for the setting aside of the grazing land
by the‘ Secretarypof the Interior eforuse incommon by said Indians.
There is no provision of that cwacter in the Jerome Agreement.
Article VI of the Jerome Agreement provided i‘or the payment to
the petitioners the sun oi‘ $2,000,000 as follows: $200,000 in cash to
be distributed per capita within 120 days after the ratification of the
agreement; $200,000 to be paid out for the Indians under the direction
of the Secretary of the Interior, and $100,000 to be paid in the same
manner within one year from the date of the second payment, and the
remaining $1,500,000 to be retained in the Treasury of the United
States to the credit of the Indians and to draw interest at the rate
of five per centum per emrtn, the interest .to be distributed to the
Indians per capita each year. In the purported ratification of the
agreement, Article VI was changed to provide for the payment of said
$2,000,000 as follows: $500,000 to be distributed per capita to the
members of said tribes in such manner as the Secretary of the Interior
shall deem to be for the best interests of the Indians, and the balance of the peynent to be credited to the Endians and the interest

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 505 _ 6 __ p ' 525

thereon distributed as provided in the Jerome Agreement. Thus, it
willpbe seen that a substantial change was made in the ‘terms of payment; but that was not all, for in the last paragraph of the Act of
June 6, 1900 [Finding 3 (i? the payment of the $1,500,000 is required
to be held until anvalleged claim of title to said land by the Choctaw
and Chickasaw Nations had been determined, and in_the event that it
should be adjudged in any suit brought by the Choctaw 9-Dd Chickasaw
Nations, as authorized by said Act of June 6, 1900 that they have any

compensable right in said lands, the payment of said sum of $1,500,000

0 shal1_'be_ subject to_ such legislation as Congress may deem proper. No

such condition or contingency as this appearsin the Jerome Agreement.

Again, the Jerome Agreement, by Article III, reserved sections 16

and 36 in each township for public school purposes, and such school
lands may not be selected for allotments unless occupied by Indians.
This provision was not substantially changed in the ratified agreement.
However, in the legislative portion of the Act 61' 1900 following the
purported ratification of the agreement _[finding 3 (cg, it is provided
that in addition to sections 16 and 36 in each township of the cession
which shall be reserved for use of the ccmmon schools, sections 13 and
33 in each township were reserved for the university, agricultural
colleges, normal schools, and public buildings of the Territory 
future State of Oklahoma, and in the event that a part of the reserved
sections should be occupied, land in lieu thereof might be selected.

Sections 13 and 33 were not reserved by any provision of the Jerome

1 Ind. C1. Comm. 505 ~ _ 7 H ,, 526

Ageement, or for that matter, by any provision of the agreement
ratified bv the Act of 1900. The reservation of sections 13 and 33
would perhaps not affect the Indians unless they were not subject to
tallotments

Furthermore, and contrary to the Jerome Agreement, it is provided.
in the legislative portion of said Act that the lands allotted to the
Indians, which may contain valuable mineral deposits, such deposits
shall be open to location and entry under the then existing mineral laws
of the United States, which were extended to cover the said lands.
Ziindins 3.(s):7. ’

And furthermore, bynrticle III of the Jerome Agreement provision
was made for the classification of the lands to be allotted into grain»?growing and grazing land, and the allottees were required to select at
least half of their allotment in grazing land., This provision was entirely eliminated from the agreement set forth in the 1900 Act.

3. From the foregoing it will be seen that there were not only

substantial changes made in the Jerome Agreement as it was acted upon
by Congress, but the legislative provisions following the purported
ratification in the Act of 3.900 added further conditions and restrictions to the plan agreed to by the Indians and the Cmmissioners
appointed to negotiate the agreement, and, as we have stated before,
the new plan or arrangement adopted by Congress in said not was never

submitted to the Indians for their acceptmce or approval, and was

never a,=_.=,'reed to by t‘ner»..

9. The appointment of Commissioners to negotiate an agreement
with the petitioners for the government's acquisition oftheir lands,
and the Jerome Agreement consummated with the Indians, in’, truth and
in fact amounted ‘to nothing more than an offer bythe Indians to cede
their lands for the consideration and upon the terms and conditions
set forth in the Jeromeggreement, because any agreement that might
be entered into was subject to the approval of Congress, not only by
the express provisions of section 134 of the Act of March 2, 1889,

35t51'»8-t. 980, but by the express provisions of the Jerome Agreement
itself.

I

10. It is elementarvlaw thatphen an offer is made, as was done
here by the Jerome Agreement, the acceptance of it must be substantially
as made,  there must be no variation between the acceptance and the
offer. In other words, the acceptance must be without substantial

‘ qualification, condition, or departure from the offers 12 Am. Jurc.
P.‘ 593. sec. 53; Iselinv. United States, 271 U. S. 136, 70 L. Ed. 872;
Minneapolisetc. v. Columbus, 119 U. s. 1}L9', 30 L. Ed. 376; First
National Bank v. sell, 101 U, s. 50. 25 L. Ed. 822.

11. It_is plain from the above that the passage of the 1900 Act
created no contractual obligations on the part of petitioners for the
Jerome Agreement was substantially changed by Congress, not only by
the Changes of its terms and the addition of new clauses,  by

1_9gis1atively imposing conditions  restrictions which affected the

1 Ind. C1. Comm. 505 ' 528
T 9 3

Indian selection and enjoyment of their allotments and the payment of

the purchase price. Accordingly, Congess ignored the offer of the

_ petitioners to sell in the manner and upon the conditions set forth

in the Jerome Agreement, and by virtue of said not the Government
acquired the land without the consent of the Indians upon its own
terms and conditions and in disregard of the rights of the Indians
under the treaty of October 21,1867. That the Government had this
power no one can deny, Lone Wolfov, United States, 187 U. S. 553,

11:7 L. Ed, 299. However, by exercising the powerit had does not re?lieve defendant from paying the Indians any damages they may have sustained through such action,

12. Because of the above, it is not necessary to determine
whether the inoperative Jerome Agreement was obtained by fraud, duress,
mistake, or based upon an unconscionable consideration, or whether the
number of Indians, required by Article 12 of the 1867 treaty, executed
it,

13. So, we reach the conclusion that under our rules of procedure
[§ec. 22 (117 the petitioners have sustained the issue of fact and law ,
relating to their right to recover; however, since an award is dependent
upon  difference, if any, between the value of the land at the time
it was acquired by the defendant and the amount paid, less allowable
offsets, that question can only be determined upon a final hearing of
the claim. Our order will now be, therefore, that the case proceed

for the purpose of detemining the difference, if any, between the

value of the land of June 6. 1900: and the purchase pfice paid. pe-F

titioners; and the amount of offsets. if any. the defendant may be
entitled to. .
