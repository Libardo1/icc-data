Attorneys‘ Fees z

.________________
On Jurm2Il7, 1958 we made the plaintiff the final award of $hl6,2hO.85. Under

the contract between the tribe and the attornev E. L. Crawford, it was provided

that the attorney should receive for legal services lO per cent of any and aLl:nn£

or of the value of any and.all property recovered. And the claim for attorneys

for the anmunit of 3hl,o2h.C8 is 10 per cent of the net judgment recovered, and is

7 Ind. Cl. Comm. 92 93

in accordance with the terms of the aforesaid approved contract and is therefore approved and allowed in said amount. It is shown by approved assignment
and transfer from Attorney E. L. Crawford that'the said Crawford and Joseph W.
lreagh became the sole attorneys for the tribe and therefore award of the
aforesaid attorneys‘ fees is made to E. L. Crawford and Joseph W. Creagh. The
Said Crawford and Creagh can apportion the fee between themselves in accordance
with their agreement therefor.

Reimbursable Expenses -- Attorneys

 

In connection with the original contract of employment E. L. Crawford.was
paid by the plaintiff Indians the sum of $2,000 as provided for in the contract for use as expenses in the prosecution of the claims of the tribes. Mr.

the total amount of $901.85, with the request that same be approved. ‘we allow
all of the items claimed except $S.o8, excess amount charged for a roomette on
July 2h, l953, and the amount of $19.18 charged for letterheads and copy sheets
on December b, l953. These items are not thought to be proper expenses and
therefore not chargeable to the tribe and when deducted.from.$90l.8S leaves an
expense disbursement of $876.99, which we approve. The balance of the $2,000
fund deposited with the attorney by the tribe is alleged to have been expended
on another claim, which expense charges are not before us in this case.

dMr. Crawlord asks for an allowance for expenditures from his own fungi Am
the prosecution of this litigation in the amount of $1,283.95. we allow this
except the iten.of $7.00 charged on June h, l9Sl for fourteen Certificates of

Claim of Q73? in Behalf of Dorothy Crawford: a Stenofraohic Employee.

     

The attorney's Contract provides that he may employ stenographic assistance
as expense incidental to his employment. The work done by Hrs. Crawford seems
partly to h ve been research sort and other nor“ not ordinarily done by a regular attorney‘s secretary and partl" work that should oo furnished by an attorney

ior the cotcensation received by him. Se feel that $375 should be adeouate for
the work cone that is properly chargeable to the tribe and therefore this claim

in behalf of Irs. Crawford is allowed in the amount of 4375.

The Bureau of Indian affairs objects to the item of $2,050 claimed
by ur. Fuller for "stand-b‘ and minor active services” and contends that it

does not appear to be a proper expense and should be disall wed. The Department of Justice concurs in that recommendation. This Commission is of the

opinion that no such obligation was assumed in the contract made with Kr.

Fuller and that no substantial services are shown to have been performed under

this claim and therefore we disallow said charge of §2,CSC.

V 0

Jith respect to the $7,500 claimed by'Er. Fuller, neither the Bureau f

0

Indian Affairs nor the Department of Justice makes any recommendation as to the

same, but the plaintiff tribe protested the payment of same in full and expresses
the opinion that such charge should not be more than 35,000.

to arrive at his final appraisal value. Yo-allowance has been made for

lands as a unit with all amenities appurtenant thereto. Separate values
cannot be placed upon the growing timber, the fish in the stream, the
harbors along the coast, the scenery, the logged-off or bare lands, and
other subsistence resources as was done by plaintiffs‘ appraiser. Furthermore, none of the sales in recent years concerning which evidence was introduced by plaintiffs and upon which plaintiffs‘ appraiser relied, can be

made the basis of value in 1892 in the way applied by him.
The Department of Justice in its comments on the work of Mr. Fuller stated:

Although the method of appraisal adopted by Er. Fuller was too speculative and theoretical to be worthy of much consideration by this Commission in arriving at the fair market value of the lands involved in this
case, considerable information that was undoubtedly helpful to the
Commission was included in.Hr. Fuller‘s appraisal report. Much of the
historical information in his report, h waver, was undoubtedly in Er.
_Fuller‘s possession when he started work upon this case since he has
been similarly employed only a few years before in appraising the neighboring lands in Alcea Band of Tillamcoks v. United States. Although the
valuation date in the Alcea case was ld5S and in the present case 139b,
the Alcea investigation and appraisal unquestionably lessened the time
required by Hr. Fuller for the present appraisal.

 

 

The record shows that Er. Fuller was at the time of testifying in the case
79 years of age -- that he belonged to no real estate or sinilar type of land
organization, and that among expenses for which he was reimbursed there were
several items for moneys paid out by him for research by employees.

There is no basis for determining theamount of tine used by Mr. Fuller in
doing the work, for which he charges $7,500, except his own statement that it
took him lb?-l/8 days of eight hours per day. It is the opinion of this Commission that not more than 100 days could possibly have been given by a competent appraiser to the securing of the info nation to which the Commission gave

any consideration and by‘reason of which the plaintiff received any benefit. In
this connection, attention is called to the fact that Mr. Fuller had testified
in other Indian claims before the Court of Claims and this Commission, and should

'v.d"""-s

have known the type of information to which these tribunals gave consideration in

-1 -- '~  9'!’
» ind. C... (,ou...-. 92

determining market value. ‘

It should also be taken into consideration that in the instant case the value
of only'l9l,798 acres (a small acreage for an Indian claim) was involved.

Taking into consideration the matters herein mentioned, together with the
charges made for sinilar work in other cases, we feel that we must allow no

larger fee to Mr_ Fuller than $5,000. We, therefore, disallow all the charge

as made by Mr. Fuller except in the amount of $5,0CO,'whiCh We allowi
