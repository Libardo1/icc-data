Beside the fur traders the Kootenai Indians were found in the region of?

Upper Kootenai but also the Lower Kootenai in about l8h6. Father de Smet
‘wrote of his journey to visit the Arcs-a-plats (Lower Kootenai) on the
Kootenay River. This missionary reported “The Flatbows and Kootenais

such as berry picking,,hunting, trapping and root digging were also

scoured their territory making temporary oamns at the sites where the

seasonal activity was to take place. In many of these food-gathering

activities the Bonners Ferry Kootenai.participated only in fanily groups

‘winter hunts and deer drives.;%/

instructed with respect thereto as follows:

It is the exoectation of the Deparhnent that the sum appropriated, will prove sufficient to defray all expenses incurred
in and incident to making conventional arrangements designed
to be permanent, with all the Tribes and fragments of Tribes
within your Superintendency, by which the United States will
extinguish their claim of title to all the lands within the
Territory, excepting such.limited.districts as it may be
necessary to assign them for their occupancy in future; % %*%

(b) On July 16, l8SS, at Hell Gate, Montana, Isaac Stevens of
‘Washington Territory, concluded a treaty with the confederated tribes of
the Flathead, Kootenai and Upper Pend d'Oreilles Indians. By.Article l

of said treaty (l2 Stat. 975, II Kapp. 722) the Indians, parties to the

"treaty, ceded, relinquished and conveyed to the United States al_ their

right, title and interest in and to the country occupied or claimed.by
them and described as follows: (Royce Cession No. 373)

Commencing on the main ridge of’the Rocky Mountains at the
forty-ninth (h9th) parallel of latitude, thence westwardly'on
that parallel to the divide between the Flat-bow or Kootenay‘
River and Clarke's Fore, thence southerly and sontheasterly
along said divide to the one hundred and fifteenth degree of
longitude, (llS°) thence in a southxesterly direction to the
divide between the sources of the St. Regis Borgia and the
Coenrtdialene Rivers, thence southeasterly and south rly along
the main ridge of the Bitter Root Hountains to the divide be'ween the head-waters of the Koos-hcos-kee River.and of.the?.
southwestern fork of the Bitter Root River, thence easterly‘
along the divide separating the waters of the several tributaries of th Bitter Root River free the waters flowing into
the Salmon and Snake Rivers to the main ridge of the Rocky
Ho'ntains, and thence north rly along said main ridge to the

8. T.e Commission, based.upon all of the evidence and testhnony
of record, finds that the Bonners Ferry Band (now known as the Kootenai
tribe or band of Indians of the State of Idaho) has by substantial
evidence proven that it aboriginally'exclusively used and occupied the
following described lands within the present states of Idaho and Montana:
Beginning on the northwest on the International Boundary
at the crest of the Selkirk Hountains and running along the

crest of said.mountains in a southeaster-y direction to the
headwaters of Ross Creek, thence in northeasterly direction

along said crest to Kootenay Falls, thence in a direct no.ther_y
direction to the International Boundary, thence westerly along
said boundary to the point of begi;.ing.

The boun‘aries of the area found to be exclusively used and occupied
by t.e Bonners Ferry Kootenai are the same as are depicted on Petitioner’s
Exhibit 7, with the exception of the eastern boundary which is changed to
run directly north from Kootenay Falls to the InternationalBoundary.

There is evidence to the effect that the Upper Kootenai (Tobacco Plains)
also hunted in the Yaak River valley. ;g/

9. The In ian title to the lands described in Finding 8 was acquired
by defendant under and by virtue of the treaty of July 16, l8S§, and the
defendant has never compensated the petitioner, its members or the

\

ancestors of'its members for the value thereof.

the Tobacco Plains Kootenai hunted in the Yaak River valley and
that he did not an w an t the division line between them and the
