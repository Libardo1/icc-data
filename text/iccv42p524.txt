INTERLOCUTORY ORDER

1. By decision of the Commission in these dockets dated
December 26, 1973, 32 Ind. C1. Comm. 400, it was determined that the
Potawatomi Tribe or Nation held recognized title to Royce Area 78 and
that said area was ceded to the United States pursuant to the Treaty

of August 24, 1816.

2. By order of the Comission dated August 6, 1975, the joint
stipulation of the parties in these dockets, dated July 11, 1975, was
approved. Under said stipulation, the parties agreed that Royce Area

78 as of August 24, 1816, and Royce Area 98 (see item 3,below) as of
October 2, 1818, had equivalent fair market values. The parties also
agreed that Royce Area 78 contained 783,150.47 acres. The parties
further agreed that the fair market value of Royce Area 78, as of
August 24, 1816, shall be calculated by multiplying 783,150.47 acres
by the amount which is determined by final judgment after exhaustion
of all appeals to be the fair market value (before any reduction for
consideration or offsets) of Royce Area 98, as of October 2, 1818.
Each party reserved the right to seek review of and to appeal from the
Commission's determination of the fair market value of Royce Area 98

in Docket Nos. 15-D, et al. (see item 3, below).

PottawatomDaTribe of Indians, et al. v. United States, Dockets 15-D,
et al., 42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 354, it was determined that the fair market
value of Royce Area 98, as of October 2, 1818, was $1.15 per acre.

On the basis of the foregoing and pursuant to the above joint
stipulation of the parties, the terms of which stipulation are incorporated herein by reference, the Commission concludes:

A. That the acreage of the lands ceded pursuant to the Treaty
of August 24, 1816, described as Royce Area 78, consisted of 783,150.47
acres; and

B. That the fair market value of such ceded lands was $1.15
per acre.

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that, subject to the terms and conditions
of the stipulation approved August 6, 1975, the plaintiffs recover
from the defendant the sum of $900,623.04, less any consideration,
payments on the claim, and offsets to which the defendant may be
entitled under the provisions of the Indian Claims Commission Act.

Dated at Washington, D. C., this 30th day of August 1978.
