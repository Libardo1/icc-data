Decided: December 13, 1955

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT

The Commission makes the following findings of fact which are

3uPP1emental to the findings numbered 1 to 5, heretofore made herein:

6. By virtue of the Treaty of October 21, 1867, 15 Stat. 581,
the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Tribes of Indians acqnired title to
2,991,933 acres of land (described in Finding 1) situated generally in

the southwestern part of what is now the State of Oklahoma. This area
is indicated and described as tract No. 510 in Royce‘s Land Cessions.
By the provisions of Section 6 of the Act of June 6, 1900, (Finding 3)
the United States acquired 2,033,583 acres of the lands within the
reservation for a consideration of $2,000,000. By said provisions of
the.Act of June 6, 1900, the Indians were given at least ninety days
to select allotments of 160 acres each and certain other lands were
reserved to their use. The parties to this action have stipulated

(Pet. Ex. 102, Tr. 3&8, 577) the acreage as follows:

7. Finding M, heretofore made by this Commission, is hereby amended
to include in said finding at l Ind. Cl, Conn. 519, following the words
"other purposes" the words “and 23,0hO acres for a wood reserve" so that

said finding will describe accurately the disposition of the reservation

lands,

8. Generally speaking, the coded area is located south and west

of Oklahoma City. It is bounded on the east by the 98th Meridian, and
on the south by the Red River, on the north by the Washita River, and on
the west by the north fork of the Red River. Today, the area of the
reservation is divided into and includes all of the counties of Kiowa,
Comanche, Cotton and Tillman and portions of Caddo, Grady, Stephens,
Washita and Jefferson Counties in Oklahoma.
9. Oklahoma Territory, comprising generally the north.and western
part of the present state of Oklahoma, was organized in 1890 pursuant to
The first lands in Oklahoma Territory to
be opened to settlers were the “Unassigned Lands" or Old Oklahoma opened
by'Presidential Proclamation on April 22, 1889, then followed the opening
of the Oklahoma Panhandle in 1890; the Iowa, Sac, Fox, Pottawatomie and
Shawnee surplus lands in 1891; the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indian surplus

lands in 1892; the Cherokee Outlet or Strip, and the Tonkawa and Pawnee

Indian surplus lands in l893; and the Kickapoo Indian surplus lands in 1855.

14 96

The area called "Old Greer County" which was adjacent to the Kiowa,
Comanche and Apache Reservation on the west was organized in 1886 under
the laws of Texas, but in 1896 it was determined that this area was
properly a part of the Territory of Oklahoma and it was annexed to that
Territory and opened to settlement in 1897. The occupants of Greer
County, who had purchased their land from Texas prior to March l6, 1896,

were given the right to perfect title thereto under the homestead laws
by paying only the land office fees and they could also obtain 160 additional at one dollar per acre.

10. The population of Oklahoma Territory increased from 60,hl7 in

1890 to 396,90h in 1900. During this period, out of the 20,215,575 acres

of land which had been made available for settlement, a total of lh,h8l,0O0
acres had been filed on or reserved as of June 30, 1900, and there remained
in the Territory 5,733,385 acres available for homestead entry and

3,211,931 acres of these lands were located in Beaver County. Much of this

land remaining open for homesteads was described by the Governor of the

Territory in his 1900 report as being broken and rough and unfit for farm~

ing. Of the lands entered in Oklahoma Territory during the 1890-1900

period, however, only 2,300,000 to 2,800,000 acres, or from 20 to 27%, had

been listed for taxes up to the year 1900 and presumably paid for and

Patented. In 1900, Guthrie and Oklahoma City, cities of over 10,000 popur

lation, were in existence northeast of the reservation some Hoand 60 miles

distant, respectively. Chickasha on the northeastern border was a rail

center.

11. The reservation was in what has been characterized as a humid

area. The average annual precipitation in the area from 1891 to 1900

was approximately 30 inches. The average growing season in the area

usually extends from.April let to November 1st. The climate is favorable to agricultural uses although the area being subject to erratic
precipitation has had a history of drought years. The elevation Of the
reservation is approximately one thousand to fifteen hundred feet above

sea level with the exception of the Wichita Mountains in the west central
portion thereof and the area consists generally of level to rolling terrain
interspersed with streams or creeks,

12. (a) In the areas surrounding the reservation, the following
facts of record are pertinent as to the settlement of Oklahoma Territory.
Adjoining the reservation on the west was Greer County, consisting of
some 1,531,520 acres with a population of 17,922 as of 1900. Greer County,
according to the 1900 census, had 3,h65 farms containing 9l2,80h acres of
which 189,582 acres were improved. The value of these farms shown by the
census for land and improvements (except buildings) was $3,2T2,hU0, while
the buildings were valued at $392,920. Greer County was organized in 1886
under the laws of Texas but in 1896 it was made a part of the Territory
Of Oklahoma. A branch line of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad from Chickasha in Indian Territory, opened early in 1900, ran across
the northern edge of the reservation to the town of Mangum in Greer County.
(b) In 1900, Roger Mills County adjoined the reservation at the

northwest corner and had a reported population of 6,190. The county,
according to the 1900 United States census, had 762,2h0 acres with 1251
farms of a total acreage of 267,986 acres, of which Uh,273 acres were
improved.

The value of the land and improvements (except buildings) of

these farms was reported to be $970,830 and the buildings $108,250.

(c) Washita County which adjoined the reservation on the north
had a population of 15,000 in 1900. The United States census for 1900
reported the county to contain 632,320 acres of land with 2780 farms
totaling h90,h73 acres, of which 162,721 acres were improved lands.

The value of the land and improvements (except buildings) of these farms
was reported to be $3,327,320, while the value of the buildings was
stated to be $h5h,870. 6

(d) One of the three Texas counties adjoining the reservation
On the south was Clay County which had a population of 9,231 in 1900.
This county, consisting of 7hl,120 acres, was reported to have 1153
farms in 1900, totaling 637,201 acres, of which lands 191,671 acres were
improved. The value of the land and improvements (except buildings) on
these farms as of that date was reported to be $h,h62,h60, according to
the census, and the value of the buildings was $513,160. The county was
created in 1857, disorganized in 1862, and reorganized in 1873. The
Fort Worth and Denver Railroad which ran through the county had been in
operation for a number of years prior to 1900.
(e) Wichita County, Texas, also adjoined the reservation on

the south.

In 1900, it had a population of 5806. It was created in 1858

and organized in 1882. In 1900, the county, consisting of 386,560 acres,
had 399 farms containing a total acreage of 326,628, or which 106,152
acres were improved. The value of_the land and improvements (except)
buildings) of these farms was reported to be $2,630,550, while buildings
were valued at $230,150, according to the census. This county was also
served as of 1900 by the Fort Worth and Denver Railroad, and had been

for a number of years.

5 while the buildings were valued at $237,130.

(f) The remaining Texas county adjoining the reservation on the
south was Wilbarger County, consisting of h93,920 acres, which was

organized in 1881. The Census of

In 1900, it had a population of 5,759.

I 1900 reported 608 farms in the county, consisting of M0l,725 acres, of

which 116,221 acres were improved lands. The value of the land and improvements (except buildings) on these farms was reported to be $1,998,160,

The Fort Worth and Texas
Railroad opened in 1888, also ran through this county.

(g) The 1900 United States Census made a report on the Wdchita,
Kiowa and Comanche Reservations jointly, consisting of approximately
3,735,5U3 acres. On these lands there were reported to be N59 farms having U38 buildings. Of the 2,600,676 acres listed as farms, some 21,763
acres were considered as improved lands. The land and improvements,
except buildings, were reported to be worth $8,066,050, and the buildings
were valued at $165,080. On the basis of this information, the average
acres per farm would be 5:665 acres but actually much of the land in the
reservation was leased in large blocks to cattlemen -smo used the area
for grazing. As of June 1900, approximately M0 leases were in force
covering approximately 2,130,000 acres of the K. C. A. Reservation,
These leases were made with cattle ranchers for grazing purposes and
Called for payment of annual rentals in the amount of $210,632.60, and
ten of the leases required the lessees to build fences.

(h) Adjoining the coded area on the east was Indian Territory,
Immediately adjoining the K. C. A. Reservation on the east were the lands

Of the Chickasaw Nation. The United States Census for 1900 reported the

1:100

‘to be $170,80U,67§.

Chickasaw area to have l6,37h farms with 3,236,187 acres in these farms,
of which 1,111,631 were reported to be improved lands. The census reported the value of land and improvements (except buildings) of these
farms to be $18,127,010, while the buildings were valued at $2,25h,75o.
(i) The United States Census for 1900 for Oklahoma Territory,

including Indian Territory, reported 108,000 farms containing 22,988,339
acres, of which s,57h,1s7 were improved lands. The value of all farm
property was $277,525,H33, with the value of land and buildings reported
The average acreage per farm was 212.9 acres with
approximately 80 acres per farm being improved. The average value per
acre of land and buildings was $7.h3, while the average value per acre
of land alone was $6.50.

13.

had completed a line from El Reno,

The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad which, by 1891,
klahoma Territory, south into Texas,
extending north and south just east of the entire eastern portion of the
reservation and generally parallel to its border was operating in or

near the reservation in 1900, and by March 31, 1900, this railroad had
constructed a line westward from Chickasha, Oklahoma Territory, across

the entire northern border of the reservation. This branch line generally

followed the valley of the Washita River, but out across the northwestern

corner of the reservation into Greer County and terminated at Magnum in

that county,
lu. From shortly after the Civil War, to about 1880, large quantities of cattle were moved from Texas to Kansas, across the present State

of 0klahoma.via the Chisholm Trail which passed through Oklahoma just a

few miles east of, and ran parallel to, the eastern boundary of the

h 101

reservation, vollowing approximately the future course of the Chicago,
Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. After 1880, the Dodge City Cattle
Trail was generally used for that purpose and it crossed the northwestern
portion of the reservation. As of 1900, the Fort Sill and Camp Anger
Road extended from Fort Sill in a southwestwardly direction to the crossing at the Red River while another road, the Fort Sill-Texas Road, extended generally southeast from Fort Sill and left the reservation in

its southeastern corner. The Traders Trail extended generally from

Anaderko on the northern border of the reservation south through Fort Sill

and then followed the Fort Sill~Texas Road while the Stage Road extended
north from Fort Sill to Wichita, Kansas, through Anadarko. A road also
crossed the reservation from east to west, at about its center, passing

through Fort Sill,

Washita County to the north of the reservation, of Beckham County to the

and of Wilbarger, Wichita.and Clay counties, Texas, to the south of the
reservation, disclosed that over that period of time there had been 1,986
sales recorded, totaling 628,531 acres at an average price per acre of
$5.92. If the Texas sales, which occurred in an area which had been under
development for a much longer period of time, are eliminated, then the
Oklahoma sales would be 277 in number, totaling h7,761 acres at an average
consideration of $h,92 an acre for the 1s9s_19oo period.

(b) For the year 1900, the record shows that in all the above

counties in both Texas and Oklahoma there were 5&5 sales of small tracts

M 102

totaling lhl,659 acres for an average consideration of $6.h9 per acre.
If only the Oklahoma sales are considered for 1900, then there were 1M6

sales for a total of 2U,77l acres at an average consideration of $5.62

per acre.

16.

In 1900, the Governor of Oklahoma Territory in his annual report

to the Secretary of the Interior of the United States wrote as follows:

(Pet. BX. 116)

G The farm lands of Oklahoma, like those of all sections
of the country, vary in fertility, and these conditions, together with cultivation, improvements, and proximity to market,
all combine to fix the selling value of farms in the Territory.

While many farms near the larger towns sell from $25 to
$50 dollars per acre, good farms fairly well improved, from
H to lO miles from market, can be bought in any part of the

Territory from $8 to $15 per acre, and in many sections much /
cheaper.

The large immigration into the Territory the past two

years has caused a steady demand for lands, and considerable

farm property is chaneing hands in every county. The increased
demand and the absorption of all the desirable Government lands,
which will take place within a year or two, will cause a steady
increase of price of land in the Territory for the next few years.

In addition to the school and other public lands rented by
the Territory, good land can be rented in almost every county
for crop rentals of from one-third to two-fifths of corn, wheat,

and oats and one-fourth of cotton and cash rent ranging from
a $1 to $3 per acre.

The Governor listed total sales of farm lands for the months of May and

June 1900, by counties for the Territory. The average price paid per acre

in the Territory was $11.83. In Roger Mills County the average price

Per acre of 13 sales was $3.1M, and in Washita County for 18 sales the

average Price per acre was $U.70. This report also states that the principal occupation of the people of Roger Mills County was stock raising

M 103

in 1900, and that the products of the farms therein were Cattle 83d Cattle
feed, corn, cotton, and wheat. The principal occupation of the people
of Washita County was agriculture and the products of the county were
cotton, wheat, corn, caster beans, cattle, and hogs. This report states
that the principal occupation of the people of Greer County was agriculture and stock raising and that the products of the county included
wheat, cotton, corn, cane, cattle and sheep.

17. With respect to the reservation itself, the Governor of Oklahoma
Territory in his report to the Secretary of the Interior in 1900 wrote
as follows:

For years the white people of the Southwest have looked
upon this beautiful and picturesque reservation nith longing
eyes, and the zealous manner in which it has been guarded by
the Indian agents and the Indians has but served to increase
the desire to possess what appeared to many to be a veritable
land of milk and honey.

The rich bottom lands of the Washita Valley, producing
magnificent crops of wheat and corn, the fertile lands bordering many other streams, the beautiful undulating plains
istretching away to the Red River on the south and west, and
the magnificent mountain parks indeed offer an inviting field
for the agriculturist; but a thorough inspection of the entire
ireservation shows much land that is alone suitable for grazing,
and much more that is absolutely waste, while many thousand of
acres on the mountains will be absolutely valueless except for
such minerals as may be found there. A careful examination of
the land over a large portion of the reservation convinces me
that about one-half of the land which will be left for settlers
will be desirable farming land, the rest being suited for
pasture and stock feed, with a considerable area of wholly
waste land. The land that is suited for farming, however, is
of the very best, and within a few years this reservation will
be as thickly populated and as prosperous as any other portion
of the Territory, producing crops of the many products so
successfully grown throughout all Oklahoma.

While there are rich valleys and beautiful parks scattered
all over the reservation the largest bodies of uniform agricultural land lie east of a line passing north and south at
the western limit of the Fort Sill military Reservation. The

1: 101:

northeastern quarter of the reservation contains much

good land, but is somewhat broken by a chain of hills.

The southeastern quarter is mostly undulating prairie,
fertile and unbroken. The southwest quarter of the reservation is mostly high and rolling except in valleys of the
Red River. Any of the uplands will produce good crops of
wheat, but much of this part is best adapted to pasture.

In the northwest quarter is some of the very finest land

in the valleys of the streams and in the parks of the Wichita
Mountains, which occupy much of this portion.

The reservation is the best watered in the Territory.
Large rivers bound it on three sides and hundreds of streams
cross it in every direction. * 9 * There are hundreds of fine
springs, several being among the largest in the West, and good
water can be found anywhere at a depth of from 20 to M0 feet.

The rainfall is abundant in all parts of the reservation,
the official record at Fort Sill showing an average fall of
30 inches for the past nine years. The climate is delightful
and invigorating.

Iii!

The greater portion of the Indians upon this reservation
have built houses, made some few improvements, and, as they
will in the majority of cases select their allotments where
they have built, they will take up all of the Washita Valley
and many of the other choicest portions of the reservation
with the best mater and timber,

While thousands of people are looking toward this reservation and anxiously awaiting its opening, and I myself am
most desirous of seeing its early transformation from a great
cattle pasture into busy, progressive communities constituting
several counties of the Territory, * * T. A spring opening
after April 1 will leave the people to get through a year and
a half before they can have a crop to use or market, and in a
new and untried country this means much hardship and suffering
to the settlers.

18. Petitioners‘ appraiser made a study of the soils of the Kiowa,
Comanche and.Apache Reservation and grouped them into four broad soil
associations. Of these four groups, he reported that the "alluvial"
Boils were generally well adapted to crop production; that the "reddish

Prairie” soils, were generally adapted to crop production, although some

1: 105

types were suited only for grazing; that the "rolling plains" soils were
generally reasonably well suited for cultivation but many of the soil

associations in this group were best suited for pasture and grazing; and

that the "cross timbers and mountains" were the poorest soils. In his

study of the soil areas he concluded that the Indians generally Selected
slightly better quality land in general than the land acquired by the
United States in that gut of the land selected by the Indians is now
considered as fairly good land; whereas, only 83.7% of the land acquired

As of June 1900. the greater portion of the reservation lands

19.

were being used for cattle grazing, A study of the

(Finding 12 (g)).
SUrVey0rs' notes and other evidence of record such as the 1900 report
of the Governor of Oklahoma Territory reveals that a large part of the

lands of the reservation were adaptable to agiicultural uses. The

M 106

evidence further reveals that there was a great demand for the opening

of these lands for such use. The highest and best use in l900 to which

these lands were adaptable and in demand for was as farm lands to be

devoted for the most part to stock husbandry. This conclusion was shared

by the Governor of the Territory in 1900 when he said: “It is generally

conceded that stock husbandry is the most profitable branch of farming,

‘and that for agriculture to be put on a substantial and profitable basis

in a given locality enough stock should be kept on every farm to consume
the greater part of the products produced there." (Pet. Ex. 116, p. 6h9).
He also added that "the great corn, cane, and kaffir fields, the cotton
and other products afford cheap and abundant fattening foods * * ‘." Such

use of the lands in a newly opened and undeveloped country would be necessary until transportation and markets for produce become available.

20. The Act of June 6, 1900, provided that after the Indians made
their selection of individual and pasture lands that the remainder of
the land should be disposed of under the general provisions of the homestead and town-site laws of the United States. By acts of Congress the
time for opening of the area was extended. By presidential proclamation,
dated July M, 1901, the zhoee, Comanche and Apache surplus lands, together
with the Wichita surplus lands. were opened to public entry starting on
August 6, 1901. or the 2,033,583 acres acquired by the United States, the

proclamation reserved from entry and settlement certain forest and military areas and four sections of land in each township to be used for
educational and public purposes for the Territory of Oklahoma. Approximately 2,000,000 acres of land were available for homestead entry in the

h 107

two reservations, of which approximately 1,500,000 were in the Kiowa,
Comanche and Apache Reservation,

Because of the great demand for these lands among prospective
settlers, the United States determined that the choice of homesteads would
be determined by a lottery, Prospective settlers registered at two land
offices, and as their names were drawn they were allowed to make selections.
This process continued until all available land was selected. No person
was entitled to more than 160 acres of land. After lh months, a settler
who had settled on the land and made the prescribed improvements could
Secure a patent by the payment of $1.25 per acre, Other settlers could
acquire their patents at the end of 5 years, but they, too, were required

The land was tax free until patented. All hometo pay $1.25 per acre.
steaders were required to pay the regular land-office fees.
Three town-sites of 320 acres each were set aside at Anadarko, Hobart

and Lawton in the reservation, These sites were to be county seats for

the counties of Caddo,E1owa, and Comanche, respectively, which had been
created in anticipation of the opening. The tosn—sites were divided into
business and residential lots which were sold at public auction for cash.
These towns were built literally almost overnight. The gross sum received from the auction of the townsites was $736,033, with a net, after
deducting all expenses of sale, of $72h,9l7.62. i
The Act of Congress of March 3, 1901, (31 Stat. 1093, 109M) providing for the sale of the town-sites provided that the receipts from the

Sale of the lots after deducting the expenses incident to the surveying,

subdividing, platting and selling of the same, should be used to build

M 105

court houses, construct bridges, roads and other public improvements,
including payment of all expenses actually necessary to the maintenance
of the county governments until the time for collecting taxes in the
calendar year next succeeding the time of the opening. Gross fees from
homestead entries were $162,932 and net fees were $lh2,lhl, about threefourths of which would be attributable to fees on ceded lands.

A total of l6h,h16 individuals registered at one of the two available land offices in an effort to secure one of the 13,000 homesteads
available on the two reservations. The registration lasted from
July 10, to July 26, 1901. Starting August 6, 1901, drawings were had
each day until October U, 1901, in order to determine those entitled to
make a selection of land. A total of 11,638 entries were made during
the 60-day period. The remaining lands were rapidly settled upon and
entered under the general homestead laws. The Assistant Commissioner
of the General Land Office, who had charge of the disposal of these
lands, reported on October 9, 1901, "Without strife or contention, but
in a quiet, peaceful, and orderly manner these lands have passed from
the condition of an Indian reservation to that of a populous, thrifty,
Peaceable agricultural community.”

The great demand for the reservation lands existed notwithstanding
that on.May 17, 1900 there had been enacted what has been called the
Free Bomestead.Act wherein prior settlers on agricultural public lands
could acquire patents without payment except for land office fees.

This act was not then and never was applicable to the Kiowa, Comanche

and Apache Reservation. The demand for the right to settle on the

M 109

reservation and pay $1.25 per acre, plus the land office fees, for the
ceded land discloses that the settlers believed that the purchase of
the ceded land at $1.25 per acre under the generous terms of the homestead laws of the United States, plus land office fees, was a bargain.

21. The mineral resources of the ceded area as of June 6, 1900
were not of sufficient economic importance to have any effect upon the
fair market value of the lands.

22. The ceded area consisting of 2,033,583 acres had a fair market
value as of June 6, 1900. of $h,O67,l66, being at the rate of $2.00
per acre. The Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Tribes are chargeable with the
$2,000,000 consideration received under the Act of June 6, 1900, leaving
a balance payable to petitioners of $2,067,166, from which will be
deducted the offsets, if any, hereafter to be determined in accordance
with the rules of the Commission.
