Docket No. 52.

WITI, chief Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the connission.

Petitioners went to trial on their second Amended. Petition wherein
they d.escri"oed themselves nas the representatives of, and on the retion of the Choctaw Indius 3a.st of the Mississippi River." In
5 cup
Paragraph 3 of said petition petitioners allege;
what the Choctaw Indians East of the Mississippi River are an identifiable group of Indians

composed of all Indians who were residing in the
state of uississippi on septenber 27, 1830, and

their descendants now living, and who did not move west
after the treaty of September 27, 1830, (7 stat. 333),
but who remained in Mississippi and became entitled to
lands under Article 134 of said. treaty, and elected. to
take advantage of the provisions of said. article. That
petitioners and those m whose behalf this amended pe-4
tition is filed, are descendants of said Indians who
resided in Mississippi on said date, and bring this
suit to recover as successors to said group. That they
bring this suit in behalf of themselves and all other

Choctaw descendants similarly situated, and with lik
claims and demands.%! , —

Petitioners allege that their predecessors in interest are entitled to 1,1:o1L,61+o acres of land with improvements under said Article ll} of said treaty as reservations for heads of families and their
children who desired to remain east of the Mississippi River; that

their predecessors in interest elected to and did remain east of the

Mississippi River and continued so to remain, and complied with the

.provisions of said article and thereby became entitled to allotments

aggregating the said l,11O1+,51¥0 acres of land, which it is alleged the
defendant failed and refused ‘to deliver to them or to pay them the
value thereof. '

ibetitioners allege acts of congress appropriating $872,000 as
part payment to said group for lands not allotted to them and the act
of congress authorizing the bringing of a suit by the Choctaw Eation
for the claims of said Nation and its members against the United states,
and the bringing of said suit and the decision thereon by the court of
claims and the supreme Court (21 ct. cls. 59; ll9 U. TS. l) -- but that Q
petitioners herein never received any part of aid $872,000 nor any

part of the judgment rendered es a result of said lawsuit.

Petitioners pray for judgment against the defendant for the value

of 1,11-O1!-,61¥0 acres of land, or in the alternative for jndgent for the

$872,000 appropriated to pay for the scrip authorized, with interest,
and] or, that judgent be rendered against the defendant in payment of
the claims arising under said. Article 111- in accordance with the obligations of the defendant under the Treaty of 1855 (which treaty provisions were the basis for the said lawsuit and jndgent rendered as

a result thereof) with interest at five percent per annum.

Article 111- of the {ureaty of September 27, 1830, (7 stat. 333) ,

upon which petitioners! claim is based, reads as folloes:

{Article 117. Each Choctaw head of a family being
desirous to remain and become a citizen of the states,
shall be permitted to do so, by signifying his intention
to the Agent within six months from the ratification of
this Treaty, and he or she shall thereupon be entitled
to a reservation of one section of six hundred and forty
acres of land, to be bounded by sectional lines of survey;
in like manner shall be entitled to one half that quantity
for each unmarried child which is living with him over ten
years of age; and a quarter section to such child. as may
be under 10 years of age, to adjoin the location of the
parent. If they reside upon said lands intending to
become citizens of'the states for five years after the
ratification of this Treaty, in that case a grant in fee
simple shall issue; said reservation shall include the
present improvement of the head of the family, or a
portion of it. Persons who claim under this article
shall not lose the privilege of a Choctaw citizen, but
if they ever remove are not to be entitled to any porti on
of the Choctaw annuity. ‘ l ‘

who main issues are by the defendant said to be aareas of diseagreement on the laws! These are stated in defendantls brief, p. l?-!-,
and such disagreements as exist as to facts are discussed by the defendant in the discassion of the issues of law.

on I.-9a.J'¢-on Icon 0tehe defenses seriously urged are; (1) That the claims of petitioners are individual claims and therefore not within the juri sdiction of the Indian claims commission; and (2) That the Judgment
recovered in the suit of Choctaw Nation vs. United states, 21 ct.

cls. 59; 119 U. S. 1, is binding on petitioners and therefore res

judicata of the claims asserted.

The first issue is as to the nature of the claims asserted whether individual or common. These claims were unquesti onahly in

their origin the individual claims of individual choctaws and their
familieswho decided to remain in Mississippi, and to take allotments
forlands in Mississippilunder the provisions of Article 11% of the
1830 treaty, and not go west. It is the opinion of the commission,
however, that the.‘ consideration over the years "given to said claims
as an entity warrants the assertion of same as a group claim by the

‘In

petitioning group at this time. A similar situation was that of the
Loyal creeks which this commission held assertahle as an identifiable
group claim andtwhich holding was thereafter approved ‘by the court of
claims and the Supreme court. (vol. 1, I.c.c. p. 122).

In the Loyal creek case the ‘claims were individual in their
origin but this Commission held that the Act of congress made the
claim a group or common claim by making an atrard in a lump sum in
payment thereof. The opinion also held in that case that,

iithe fact that any award which might be recovered

might have to be di strihuted among the members, or

their heirs, in proportion to the individual losses

(which, according to enrollment, differ in amounts)=I

did not "change the common character of the claim in

this case ‘because the agreement of l9OO (providing
for a lump sum award) established it as a group claims!

. 4,,._._.....¢.v.—a- ..——-—-——I--Likewise, in the creek case we held that said claim was not presented
for the enforcement of "individual claims but one for the enforcement
of an.alleged obligation of the Government,H and that the %allegations
‘in.the petition.which, if taken.alone, would indicate a different
theory, but considering the petition as a whole, as we must, we believe it can.be considered as a common claim of the Loyal creeks for
the balance of the senatels award.H (vol. 1, P. 132),
In this connection attention will he called to Articles 11 and
12 of the Treaty between.the choctaws and chickasawsand the United
states dated June 22, 1855, (11 Stat. 511) wherein provision is made
for the submission of the claims of the choctaws who renained in Missis'sippi (hereinafter referred to as the nississippi choctaws) to the

United states senate for determination. while these Blaine are re-°

ferred to in the said articles of said treaty as being Hindividual,u
when the senate thereafter reported on the-sane and made an award,
said award was in.a,lnnp.snm which did not state what portion of said
sum was to he in satisfaction of the national claim, or what portion
was to be in satisfaction of individual claims, though the award was

in satisfaction of both.national and individual claims then being‘
asserted by the tribe.

3y reason of the nailnre of the United states to pay said award;
the Choctaw Nation.was permitted under the provisions of a jnrise
dictional act approved March 3, 1881, (21 stat. 50%), to bring an

action before the court of claims and suit brought thereunder by the

Choctaw Nation asserted in behalf of the Mississippi choctaws their

claims arising under Article 11-!» of the 1830 treaty. The court of

claims in its decision (El ct. cls. 107) found the beneficiaries

of Article 11% to be entitled to 225,760 acres of land worth the
sum of s}1u'{,656, and made an award to the claimant, based in part
on that finding,-*‘ in a lump sum without determining the respective
amounts to which individual claimants were entitled. This case was
appealed to the Supreme court and there a Judgment was rendered in
satisfaction of the claims of the ‘beneficiaries of Article l1I- along
with other claims without determining what proportion of said ‘
judgnent should go to the satisfaction of claims based on said
Article 011+ and what _to the ‘other -claims, or of determining the
respective amounts individual claimants mightbe entitled to under
Article 111-, (ll9iU. S. 1; 22 ct. cls. 3489). The consideration
given these claims and the judgments rendered by reason thereof‘
are very similar to the treatment accorded the claims of the
Loyal creeks. .. i T T '- E.
gttentiomis also called to the suit of the Choctaw nation

vs. United states reported in 81 Ct. (:13. pp. 1, et seq. In the
decision in this case the rightsiof the members of the chocta:-1
Tribe under Article 11.1 of the Treaty of 1830 who remained in
xississippi are discussed as the rights of a specific group, and
in reference to their rights and the disregard thereof by the
defendant, the following statement is made, to-wit;

IThe article (that is, II?) is seemingly free
from ambiguity. The rights conferred are positive

ones, defined with a degree of precision apparently
incapable of misapprehension, and notwithstanding
this fact the large number of Indians who remained
in the state were -subjected to 'a series of maladministration of the article by accredited representatives of the United States that in and of
itself discloses an inexcusable, cruel, and unjust
procedure never excelled, if equaled, in the history
of Indian affairs. Not to exceed 11!-3 heads of
families, embracing 276 individual Indians, ever
received an allotment under article XIV, and at‘
least 1,155 heads of families embracing at least
3,800 individud Indians were by intimidation,
false entries, and destroyed documents cheated out
of and denied their rights." a

Thereafter, as late as 191:0, congress gave consideration to,

t and the Committee of the House on Indian Affairs, recommended the

passage of a bill conferring upon t’.';3‘ Court of claims jurisdiction
to hear and" determine the claims of the Ifchoctax-: Indians of the
state of Mississippi’! as a group claim, which bill provided that

the amount of any judgment that might be r.2_dered by the court of

i claims in satisfaction of the claims of the Mississippi C.7".octa'..-rs

should Iibe set aside as a special fund to be paid to the clai::.ants
subject to subsequent legislation of the congress."
so, in the instant case, as in the hereinbefore referred to

Loyal creel: case, the amount of arr judgent should be set aside

C
0

to be paid to individ*;_.:._v~7 claimants under the provisions of leei =s.‘:"""‘

lation of the congress.

Another question to be decided prior to giving onsideration

Q

to the merits o: the claim of petitioners is whether or not petitioners have been bound by treaties made by the Choctaw aticn

subsequent to 1830 and by the litigation to \—.*hich reference has

here tofore be en mad e .

It is urged by the petitioners that they were not bound by the
Treaty of June 22, 1855, nor by the award made by the United states
Senate under the provi sions of Articles 11 and 12 of said Treaty of
Jime 22, 1855, nor by the jurisdictional act of March 3, lS8l, and
the decision of the court of claims (21 ct. cls. 59), and by the
Supreme Court (119 U. S. 1), rendered in litigation brought under
the said jiirisdictional act. It is recognized that Congress has
plenary powers in its dealings with Indians and with their status
and rights , tribal and otherwise - therefore, when by an act of
Congress of June 22, 1855, ‘congress approved the previous agreement
entered into between. the Choctaw Nation and the United states ':.=hereinp_
it was provided by Articles 11, 12 and 13 of said act of Congress
that all the claims of the Nation and of the individual members
thereof against the United states should be submitted to the senate
of the Upited states for determination, the Choctaw Nation was thereby
given the right by Congress to present the claims arising under Article lli to the United states senate for determination, Therefore, the
subsequent submission by the Choctaw juation of the claims of the
Mississippi choctau-rs to the United states semte was authorized and
the award of the senate, if it had bindng effect on anybody,_ had
binding effect on the Mississippi Choctaws.

Thereafter, congress by passing the jurisdictional act of

March 3, 1881, authorizing the Choctaw nation to bring the suit it

he before the court of claims for itself and for the Mississippi

Choctaws was an act of congress decreeing that the Choctaw Nation

 theiright to bring suit for those members who thought they had
not received the benefits provided for them under Article 111- of the
treaty of l830. said litigation was therefore authorized by congress ,
and said litigation and the results thereof were _z_:'_e_s judicata as to

the claims of the Mississippi \choctaws therein asserted,
In the suit brought under the jurisdictional actiof March 3,
1881 , the claims as previously presented to the United states senate

for adjudication were pleaded substantially as they had been presented

_ to the United states senate and practically fou.r—v-fifths of more than

$8,000,000 was claimed for the beneficiaries under Article 114- of the
Treaty of 1830; however, as herein previously pointed out, the United
States senate refused to allow a large portion of these claims and the
Court of (‘Jaime found that'the beneficiaries of ‘article 111- were antitled to only $1L1'{,656_._

It is urged by petitioners that after the Treaty of 1830, those
who remained in Mississippi and who never moved west were no longer
members of the Choctaw zqation, and therefore the provisions of the
Treaty of l8§5 providing for the submission of all claims by the
Choctaw Nation in behalf of itself or its individual members to the
United states senate for determination did not submit to that body
the claims of the beneficiaries of Article 114- of the Treaty of l830
because at that time they were not members of the Choctaw Iwation;
and likewise for the was reason the jurisdictiona.1 act of March 3,

1881, did not authorize suit in behalf of the beneficiaries of

Article 111- of the Treaty of 1830 because they were not at that time
members of the Choctaw Nation;

while it is true that subsequent to the Treaty of 1830 various
legislation was passed requiring members of the Choctaw Nation to
emigrate west before they were entitled to certain privileges and
rights ,.nevertheless the provisions of Article 111- of_’_che 1830
Treaty provided that those claiming 1:Lnder that article would not
lose the privileges of the Choctaw citizens and therefore it is the
opinion of this ‘Commission that the determination of their claims
was included under‘ the provisions of Articles ll, 12 and 13 ‘of the
Treaty of 1855 and was included in the jurisdictional act of 1881,
and the proceedings thereafter had under and bvvirtue of said mreaty
of 1855 and said jurisdictional Act of 1881 were binding upon said
Mississippi choctaws and their descendants, petitioners herein.

our viewpoint, therefore, is that the decisions of the court of
Claims in 21 Ct. (:13. 59-and 119 U. S. l were binding on the Mississippi Choctaws, limits the petitioners! rights, if any, at this time
to those accruing under the decisions cited.

As hereinbefore stated, neither the decision of the court of
claims (21 Ct. (:15. 59) nor that of the supreme Court (13.9 U. S. l)
undertook to distribute the award made the petitioners, that is,
between the Ration as a claimant in its own right and the 
claimants under Article 111- in whose behalf claims were asserted;
however, as herein previously stated, the court of claims found the

beneficiaries of ,g_rticle.l1l-. to be entitled to 225,760 acres of land

8 claimants were not entitled to any award by reason thereof.

which they had not received, and found the same to be of the value
of $hd7,656.

The Court of claims in arriving at the amount it found to be
due the Mississippi choctaws tool: into consideration the scrip
transactions complained of by petitioners herein and found that
53113
sipreme ‘Court upon the appeal of the case reversed the court below
and directed it to enter a judgment for the sum of $2,858,798.52,
which the.cou.rt of claims thereafter, on December 16, 1886, did.
(0115. 3x. 166)‘.

lmhe Supreme court decided that the Choctaw Nation was entitled
to a judgment in the emctamount the United States senatefnad found
it to be entitled to, to-wit, $2,9s1,21+7.30, lessa deduction of
$250,000 paid thereon, plus unpaid annuities of $59,113-I-9.32, and for
 takenirom them in fining the boundary between the State of
Arkansas and the Choctaw Nation in the amount of $68,102, 
deductions and additionspbeing transactions subseogdent to the Senate
award). In determining that the award of the senate should be made
the basis of its judgment, the supreme Court said that the matters

in controversy having been submitted to the senate for determination,

that notwithstanding the jurisdictional act anthorized the disregard 0

of said award, it was the view of the court that same furnished “the

Supreme Court's award not less than $1¥1'{,656. We think the two

decisions to-which we have referred are" res Jndicata of petitioners‘

claims. It is undisputed that said judgent was by the defendant fully

paid to the Choctaw Eation; however, petitioners contend that not one
cent thereof was paid to their predecessors in interest, or to them.
(Petitioners‘ Brief, p. 9).

That the effect of the decisions of the Court of Claims andthe
Supreme Court.‘ to which reference is made, was to award the Mississippi
Choctaws the amount of $1¥l7,656 under the provisions of Article 134 of
the 1830 Treaty, is admitted by the defendant in ‘Par. 23_ of its answer
in said case, and to statement made by the defendant on page 22 of its
brief to the effect that the claimants under Article 114 were given a
judgent “for 191 heads of families of $1;17.656'.=!

Defendant contends that ‘by reason of the aforesaid judgment and
the paymentthereof to the_ Choctawlifation. its liability is discharged;
that Article l2_of the Treaty‘ of 1855 provided that payment should ‘be
made to the Choctaw liation in full satisfaction of all claims, both .
national and_personal, against the United States; and furthermore, that
the Act of March 3, 1881. authorising the Court of Claims to ascertain
the amount of all claims__'based on the Qreaty of l830,_ including those
under Article 11!», designated the Choctavliiation as the recognized representative of all Choctaw Indians and their claims, national or individual.

the Courtpoi-' Claims and the Supreme Court to which we have referred,
it was decided that the rights of petitioners‘ predecessors in interest
had ‘been denied,._to their damage in the amount of $1!-17,656, at least.
As previously stated, the defendant in its answer filed January 29,
1953, alleges thatpthese decisions amount to an award to the Mississippi
Choctaws as 'benei‘icia.ries of Article 111- of the Treaty of 1830 in the
amount of $1¥l7,656. Said answer reads as follows:

or failed to-_ receive reservations under article 134
of the treaty of 1830 aggregating 225,760 acres,
worth the sum of $137,656; that judgment was
rendered therefor and paid, with interest at 5%

‘by the mited States by the Act of June 29, 1888,
25 Stat. 239. ‘ _ "23. Defendant further alleges that said Act
of June 29, 1888, provided that said sum should be
paid to the National Treasurer of the Choctaw Nation
in accordance with article 12 of the Treaty of June 22,

1855: and “to ‘be in full satisfaction of all claims

against the United States arising ‘under article 12 of
said treaty. '

_ "21L. Defendant further alleges that ‘by the
provisions of article 12 of the treaty of 1855 the
Choctaw Nation became liable and bound to pay all
individual claims. including the claims of the petitioners herein; that if the petitioners, or any
of then, failed to receive the several amounts due

then: their recourse is against the Choctaw lifation.
and not against the defendant, the United States.“

In the answer of the defendant previously filed on September 12,
1952, it had pleaded inPar. 9 thereof that “the Choctaw Nation for
aha on behalf of the reserveesunder article in of the treaty of 1830
fully litigated their claims and recovered a Judgent in the sum of
$11-17,655.00, “with interest, which has ‘been paid.”

Thereafter, in dei‘endant’s brief on page 22, it is stated that
judgment was rendered in-ljtfthe Court of‘Claims “f or 191 heads of families
for $3-$17,656 as compensation for an election under rt. 114- of the Treaty
of 1830.“

Ont of said final Judgment rendered in said cases, it is our
opinion that the predecessors in interest of petitioners should have

been paid said amount by the defendant.

 E ‘ p '   3 308

The question next to be determined, therefore, is whether or not
the payment of said judgent" to the Choctaw Nation discha.rged the de-.fendant‘s liability, if as a matter of fact petitioners or their prede- .
cessors in: interest received no part of same. _ Article 12 of the Act of

June 25, 1855, provided that the payment of anyaward made by the Senate

of the United States should be made topthe "Choctaws.“ (While the

language of said Act does not "say “Choctaw Nation," presumably by

"Choctams" is meant said Nation). and that the Choctaws should thereupon

 become liable and bound to pay all individual claims -_-"-_ (presumably re;

ferring to the claims. of the Mississippi Choctasrs) as might be judged

in accordance with Article 12 of the Treaty ‘between the United States and

the Choctaw Nation, concluded June 22, 1855 *3 * same to be in full

satisfaction ofall claims against the United States arising under
Article 12 of said Treaty.”

We are of _the opinion that by reason of the provisions of Article
111» of the Treaty of 1830, wherein those who remained ‘in Mississippi
were to he provided reservations ‘by the defendant to be taken from
the land by said treaty ceded to the defendant, that the defendant
‘became obligated to those entitled to such reservations to provide .

same for them. or in lieu thereof to compensate them for the value of
such reservations not provided them. We are further of the opinion

that when judaent was rendered which included compensation for such

reservations not provided then (which is admitted by the defendant),
that in order to discharge defendant's liability to them it was its

duty" to see that whatever was due then out of said judgent was paid

over to them.

In letterof the ‘First Assistant Secretary of the Comissioner

of Indian Affairs of date January 31, l9l3, to_the Commissioner of the

Ole.‘ hgl 3 . (Emphasis supplied

   

The _report of the General Accounting Office, page 370 of Defendant's

Exhibit 17, shows that the disbursement made by the United States of the
3115-@ent involved waspznade “for the benefit of the Choctaw ‘Nation of
Indians west of__the Mississippi Bd.ver."_

Counsel for the defendant in his argument orally "stated that the
defendant had been unable to show that any part of this judgment was
Paid to the Mississippi Choctans - that"is, to the predecessors in
interest of petitioners. A

It therefore see-ns that thedefendant undertook to dischargeits
liability to the Mississippi Choctaws, by’pa.yment of monies‘ to 1-which
they were entitled, to the Choctaw Nation, and by depending upon the
Nation and its tribal authorities to see that the Mississippi Chocta-as
got compensation for reservation lands to which they were entitled under
Article 11+ of the‘ Treaty but did not receive. By reason of‘ the obligations assuned.by the defendant under the provisions of Article l1I- of
the Treaty of 1830, and of Article 12' of the Treaty of June 22, IS55,
it is the opinion of this Comission that it was the duty of the defendant to see that the beneficiaries of Article 11% received the amount‘
of said judgent to which they were entitled, to--sit, $337,656, and that
by reason of the failure of the defer. t government to see that said

@'0‘0-2,0 was Paid said amount, that petitioners herein are entitled to an

award against the defendant for the amount of $417,656.

"E

'£he petitioners do not directly assert a claim by reason of the

 , provisions in 21 Ct. C13. 59 and 119 U. S. 1, but contend that said

litigation was not authorized by them and does not bind them, and they

insist that their measure of damages is the value of the lands they;

should have received under the provisions of Article 11!» of the Treaty
of 1830; however, in the alternative, they allege liability by reason
of the provisions of the LT:-eaty of 1855, which liabiiity we have found d
was discharged by the judgment in 21 Ct. C13. 59 and 119 U.S. 1. Our
holding is that said Judaent binds the petitioners and determines their
rights, but that not having been paid the amount of the jud.@ent that
was ‘due them, that they are enti tied to an award for the amount of same

due them, to-wit, $517,655, and it is so ordered.
