COUNT I
The first cause of action is for the value of 3)'i'9-755g)'!'I'i'8.o>2)'i‘ acres
of land lying west of the Mississippi river and between the Arkansas,
Canadian and Bed rivers ceded by the plaintiff tribe to the defendant
by treaty dated August 21;, 1818 (7 stat. 176). The boundaries of this
vast area of land are fixed by the treaty as follows:
Beginning at the mouth of the Aricansaw river; thence
extending up the Arkansaw, to the Canadian fork, and up
the Canadian fork to its source; thence south, «to Big Red
river, and down the middle of that river, to the Big Raft;
thence, a direct line, so as to strike the Mississippi
river, thirty leagues in a straight line, below the mouth
' of the Arkansaw; together with all their claims to land

east of the Mississippi, and north of the Arlcansaw river,
included within the coloured lines, 1, 2, and 3, on the

above map,

In addition to the above-described land the plaintiffs seek recovery
for the value of 8,765,lL1%—0 acres of land lying east of the Mississippi
river and north of the .é.rkansas river. The boundary of this area is
indicated by colored lines appearing on a map attached to the treaty,
which shows that part of the acreage runs along the Mississippi river
on the east bank and a larger part is located west of that river and
north of. the Arkansas river. (see map attached to Plain. BX. 122).
The total acreage of the above two areas is alleged to be 1+3,52O,888.2H
and does not include l,l6_'5,6O1é.-.75 acres which were reserved for the
use of the Quapaw by said treaty of 1818, the latter being the subject
of the claim set forth in Count II, later to be considered. The said
acreage of l;3,52o,.sss,21; is that which lies east of the one-hundredth

meridian of west longitude, as the plaintiffs cake no claim based upon

1 Ind. C1.1Comm. 469 ~ 476

(‘£533

lands lying west of that meridian although within the described boundary of the cession. The amount claimed in this cause of action is
upwards of $5M,397,ll0s30, with.intcrest from 1818 at the legal rate.

The plaintiffs, in their first cause of action, claim that the
Quapaw held the land ceded by them by the treaty of 1818, by original
Indian title. Therefore, the burden rests upon the claimant tribe to
prove it occupied the area ceded and.to the exclusion of other tribes
of Indians. Pawnee v. United states, Docket No. 10, decided July 11+,
l950, and cases cited.

.According to the evidence, the Qnapaw were found by Desoto to be
living in.an area west of the Mississippi river and between the St.
Francis and.arkansas rivers. Desoto reached this area about June, l5El,
and referred to this tribe under the name of Capahae In the account
of the expedition it was estimated the Capaha comprised five or six
thousand Indians (Plain. Ex. 1..., p. 3, and ms. 3, p. 2) end they seemed
to occupy an area at the confluence of the Stt Francis river and the
Mississippi. The Quapaw, as we now refer to this tribeg have been
called Capaha, Pacaha,.Akensea, and numerous names by the chroniclers
and historians. Desoto extended his explorations westerly between the
.Arkansas and Red (Rouge) rivers for a considerable distance and no mention is made in the chronicles of the expedition of the Qnapaw
(Capaha) at any place between those rivers, however, he does mention
the Casqui and Cayas (neither of which names seem to have been applied

to the ca-pane) and ‘De :I.=1.:1s1e=s map (1700) attached to En. 1;, shoes

that the Osages, Apaches and Paducas were located to some extent between those rivers, and lower down the Gadodaquois were located on

both sides of the Bed river and a Quapaw village (Akansa) was located
south of the Arkansas river near its junction with the Mississippi.
Those ‘early explorers who followed DeSoto,_ including Father Marquette '
(1673), La Salle (1682), Tonti and St. Cosme. (1698), seem agreed that
the Quapaw were located in small numbers along the east bank of the
Mississippi river and in larger numbers along the west bank, ‘both

north and south of the confluence of the Arkansas and the Mississippi
rivers, also westerly along the Arkansas to quigato or Goligua (supposed to be near Little Rock, A,rk.)s Those Quapaw who resided on the

side long before the tribe moved south from the St. Francis river
area. Dr. Swanton fires the time as about the year 1700, and since
that time the entire tribewas located west of the Mississippi river.
We find nothing in the "chronicles of the early explorers to warrant
the belief that the Quapaw occupied any substantial area as far south
as the Red river. A study of the evidenceleads to the conclusion that
the Quapaw did not occupy, since l700i, more than a comparatively small,
but undefined, area along the Mississippi river on the west, between
the St. Francis and Arl-ansas rivers, and up the Mkansas river on its
southerly side, to about the vicinity of Little Rock, Arkansas. True,
the map "carte De La Louisiana," (1679-82), (part of Plaintiffs“ m.

10), shows a name ”0umppa,” supposed to be a designation of the Quapaw

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 469 478

. - 5‘tribe, which plaintiffs insist shows that the Qnapaw possessed and

claimed the territory as far west as the headwaters of the Arkansas
river. Assuming the name indicates_the presence of Quapaws at the
headwaters of the AIkansas,_it is sufficient to point out that those
Indians did not cede any lands in that vicinity, and are not now claims-H
ing that they did, for the lands ceded by the 1818 treaty extend to
the headwaters of the Canadian river, which ista tributary of the
Arkansas, and located far south and‘west of the headwaters of the
.Arkansas. .Again, we could hardly base a finding of possession upon
such tenuous.evidence. Dr, Swanton testified that the Qnapaw never
lived at the headwaters of the Arkansaso (pp. 681--2 of mi-e.ns.,,)
we have mentioned the fact that in l5hl Desoto estimated the
0 population of the tribe to be from 5000 to 6000 persons. Father Vivier
(1750) speaks of the inkansasn as "an Indian tribe of about #00 warriore,» and Porter (Schoolcraft, Ind. Tribes), gives 500 as their mmber

in 1329. (Plain., Ex. 1, p. 3).. In a memorial of the irmsee Legislature (1820) to the President they refer to the Quapaw as being “now
reduced to between 3 and M00 souls.“ (Plain. Ext l6)o And in a rem
port to his comnanding officer, dated Jan. 309 1818 (less than seven
months prior to the treaty of 1818) we find So H. Longa Majorg T,
Engineers, writing:
“The Qnapaws, a small tribe residing south of the

.Arkansaw, between 100 and 150 miles above its confluence
with.the Mississippi, at present able to furnish no more

than sixty or seventy warriors * * ¢” (Def. Eng No. HQO

llnd. c1. Comm. 469 ‘ . 479
T 6 1

‘Time, we find a once powerful tribe dwindling in numbers until at the
time of making the treaty ‘of August 21;, 1818, there remained but a
handful ofllndians, perhaps less than 50o. It is difficult to see how
such a small tribe could subject such a vast area of land to its will
and control so as to constitute the basis for a claim of aboriginal
possession.

We have above shown that for a period of perhaps two hundred years,
or more, the Quapaw occupied an undefined area between the St. Francis
and Arkansas rivers and immediately west of the Mississippi river, but

I on November 10, 1808; the Great and Little Osage made a treaty with the
United. States by which they ceded a large area of land which included
all the territory north of the Arkansas and west of the Mississippi
river formerly occupied by the Quapaw. The record does not disclose
when the Quapaws moved south" of the Arlmnsas, but it may be presumed
that either they abandoned the territory north of the Arkansas or

yacated that area because of the Osage. In any event, the witnesses,

Dre. Swanton and Willey, located them south of the Arkansas in 1805,
and on January 30, 1818, Major Long found them settled south of the
.A.rkansas “between 100 and 150 miles above its confluence with the Missis'SiPPi ‘H "' *." (See report of Major S. H. Long of T. Engineersg dated
January 30, 1818.) (Defendant‘s me 1+). In this same report Long states
that the Osages claim to the country “appears to have a better foundertion, and can probably be more easily substantiated than that of any

other tribe or nation of Indians, not only in consideration of their

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 469 T _   480
.. 7 ..

_having been the original stalk (stock) when the Quapaws separated
but also of the great extent of country in this quarter, recognized
by the United States as having belonged to them, and of their former

ability to keep possession of it, by resisting the encroachments of

their Indian neighbors.”

These Indians, long before they moved from the St. Francis river
area to the Arkansas river, had become agriculturists and they cone
tinued the sedentary agricultural life after they located.along the
.Arkansas. They had long prior to reaching the.Arkansas river area
abandoned the hunter life as a principal means of subsistence, and
whatever hunting or trapping was done by them was confined to areas
in the vicinity of their villages. This probably accounts for the

fact that there is no proof of any hunting excursions to the west that

would indicate the use or assertion of control over the vast area they .

are here claimingy extending some H00 miles west of their villages.
The archaeological record of Qnapaw occupation tends to place
those Indians in the eastern part of Arkansas along the Mississippi
river and above and below the Arkansas river, but not very far up the
latter river. According to Dr. Willey, the evidence of Quapaw occupation along the Arkansas river diminishes as one proceeds up the
river Lite. Ex. 5~W—l7 and ho. 6(¥§7; and above Little Rock, is replaced by Caddoan archaeological remains. This sort of evidence
confirms to some extent the documentary and historical proof offered

as to the areas occupied at the time of the 1818 treaty, which

1 Ind. C1. Conn. 469 — -. -.w *81

. - 8 - '

indicates the occupation of an area substantially conforming to that
reserved in that treaty, although the settlements were, so far as t'?‘3
proof discloses, entirely along the Arkansas river, extending from
Arkansas Post to Little Rock. ‘

. The judicial question here presented is as to the sufficiency cf
the evidence to establish the aboriginal possession of the plaintiff’
tribe to the territory claimed.

In the case, Pawnee Indian Tribe v. United States, llocket No. rot

i decided by this Commission on July lit, 1950, an extensive review of

the authorities governing aboriginal rights was made, and based upon’
those authorities, we concluded that it is a question of'.i‘act to be
determined as any question of fact, whether a claimant tribe occupis’d
land in the United States as aboriginal occupants, and we there also’
decided that to constitute aboriginal possession it must be established
as a fact that there was actual occupancy of definable territory by
the tribe asserting the title. It is perhaps not required that the
bcundarylines be as accurately defined as a surveyor would like the”
but some general boundary lines of the occupied territory must be
shown, and it must be shown that the occu@t had the possession to
the exclusion of other tribes; constructive possession is not su_f-ficient. see U. s. v. Santa Fe Rs... 311:. ms. 339, 86 1.. ed. 260;

- not be necessary to review them here.

. Applying the rule for determining the existence of original

‘ Indian title, that'is, the Indians‘ right of occupancy based. upon

aboriginal possession, as stated in the above cases} we find the proof
offered falls far short oi‘ showing original lndian title to all the
lands claimed. The most that can be said for the proof submitted is,
as beiore stated, that the Quapaw, at the time of the lSl8 treaty, occupied territory lying south oi‘ the Arkansas river between the confluence
of the Arkansas and Mississippi rivers (although there is evidence

iring the eastern location oi‘ the Arkansas Post, which is some fifteen
or twenty miles westerly from the junction of the two rivers) to what
is now Little Rock, A.rkansa‘s, a distance of perhaps one hundred miles.
There is no showing as to the distance south of the Arkansas river
these Indians actually occupied the area; not even a general idea. of
that distance is shown. 

After studying the entirerecord we can reach no other conclusion
than that the evidence shows that the only territory occupied by the
plaintiff tribe, at the time of the 1818 treaty, was a comparatively-'
813311 area along the Arkansas river, which is not a part of the area
covered by th_isCo_u.nt I of the petition, and, therefore, the claimnt

tribe has not shown original Indian title to the area of Land described

1 Ind. C1. Comm. 469 H ’ 483
s r J_ lOp__ .

in Count I of the petition. The evidence shown by the record is quite
iconvincing that the Quapaw did not occupy more land than that contained
in the reserved area. This is supported by the report of the Coma
missioners who negotiated the treaty, in which they state: “The rev

served by the Qpapaws is quite sufficient for their purposes (and in

truth is perhaps more than they actually need). It fronts on the

‘ Arkansas river more than a hundred miles, including.all their villages

and extending to the Washata - being a tract of level low rich land
interspersed with swamps, of which a great part is subject to annual
"inn-nd-a'tj-Ono”  Exo 13)o_

Counsel for plaintiff call our attention to the soucalled HotSprings cases, reported in 92.U.S. 698-716; as proof to the effect

that the United States conceded that the Quapaws were the owners of
the lands described in the_l8l8 treaty and ceded to the defendant.

It is sufficient answer to that contention to point out that the title
of the Quapaws to the land involved in that suit (although.part of the
Quapaw cession) was not in issue. hThe courtmerely assumed that the
Indian title to the land was extinguished by the treaty of l8l8. We

find nothing in the opinion indicating any inquiry into the question

‘of the Quapaw title, so, for the purposes of that case, the court

assumed, as it had the right to, that the Quapaws were entitled to

the possession of the lands ceded, but such assumption cannot_be accepted by us as proof of Indian title to all the lands ceded by said

i treaty.

1 Ind. Cl. Comm.‘ 469 I _ A ll _ L 484

And so it is with the opinion of the Attorney General, dated
May 3,, 1836 (Plaintiffs‘ ms 77). He was asked for‘an_;_opinion as
to whether any of the lands of the qlapaw, ceded by the 1818 treaty,,°
were subject to pre-enption under the not of April l2, 1811+. He was
not required to pass upon any question of fact but assumed. that the
Quapaw had original Indian title to all the ‘land ceded at the time

of the cession. Such assumption was implicit in the nature of the

inquiry, so we cannot accept his statement as evidence in support of _ i

the plaintiffs‘ claim of original Indian title to the ceded lands.
Aside from the proof of Indian title offered, the plaintiffs

contend thatby the 1818 treaty the Government recognized or ac»

'_ lmowledged the title of the plaintiff tribe in the land ceded. If

plaintiffs are correct in their contention, proof of their aboriginal
titleis unnecessary. .A.lc_ea. 17. U0 So, 103 Go Glso 391+, 551, 329' Uoso
12-09 91 L. ed-9 29. i
By the treaty, the Quapaw “tribe or nation, do hereby -H -t * iv

cede and relinquish to the United States, ‘forever, all the lands {Within the following boundaries, * '5‘ *3.” Then follows a description of
the areadescribed in the petition as lying west of the Mississippi
river between the Canadian and Arkansas rivers on the north and the
Red River on the south. After describing the cession the treaty con-~
tinues‘, ‘together with all their claims to land east of the Mississippi and north of the nrlansas riverg included within the coloured

lines 13 2 and 3, on the above map, with the exception and reservation

1 Ind, 01. Comm. 469 2 . i_ ' v y   ~ . * 485

-12following, * * *.' Following this language is a description of the

lands reserved for the use of the Indians, described in Count II of

the petition.
Counsel for plaintiffs see in the above language a purpose on the

part of the Government to recognize the aboriginal possession of the ‘

vast territory by the Quapaw, for they believe that the Indians by

e ‘ceding and relinquishing“ part of the lands and the Government by’

accepting the conveyaice in those words of grant conceded that the

iquapaw owned all the territory described. We are not impressed by the

argument, for manifestly the Indians by the words ‘cede and relinquish‘

-intended to convey all their rights, both actual and asserted, to the

territory described in the treaty. ‘Such words of grant were commonly

fused in treaties of cession and we have found no cases in which the

courts have construed them as a recognition by the Government of the

’ Indian title to the lands ceded, nor have the plaintiffs cited any:

cases so construing treaties containing such a grant. It is quite

plain.that in negotiating with Indians for land cessions it was im- I
possible in cases involving vast areas to determine the territory
actually held and exclusively occupied by a tribe, so the treaty commissioners were required to accept the claims of territory made by the
particular tribe or band with.whom they were negotiating as to boundaries in order that there would be a complete extinguishment of Indian
title, actual or claimed, but that does not mean that the Government

’°°0snized original Indian title to all lands that may be described

1 Ind. (31. Comm. 469 _, 13 _ ' 486

in a treaty.,

We believe that the Quapaws made claim to far more land than
they occupied, for we find in the report of Major Long, dated January 30, 1818 (Def. Ex. 1&),the following:

“The Quapawsg a small tribe residing on the south of
the .Arkansas, between 100 and 150 miles above its confluence with the Mississippi, at present able to furnish no
more than Sixty or Seventy Warriors, next laid claim to a
portion of the country, which they have enlarged from time
to time, at the investigation (instigation) of the French
and other Whites, who have resided and intermarried with '
them till at length they pretend to claim all the country h
under consideration. The Quapaws are a branch of the Osage
nation, as is plainly evinced by the similitude of their
language‘, shape and features, to those of the Osages, and
claim the country under the same tenure, the right of conquest and possession. Their original claim was limited as
«follows:-- Beginning at the lower end of the Village or
post of Arkansaw, on the South of the River? and running
up the River on the same side to Michael Bon3s settlement,
thence southwardly in the nearest direction to the Main
Fork of the Saline of the Washitaw, -"thence down said
Fork, Saline and Washitaw, to a point nearest to the place
of beginning, and thence Northwardly to the place of beginning;
including a tract about forty miles inlwidth and fifty in

length."

Tlms, we see the territory originally claimed by the Quapaw was the
area which in a general way conformed to that which was reserved by
them in the 1818 treaty and which the treaty commissioner reported
(Plaintiffs! Ex. 13) as quite sufficient for their purposes and per-haps more than they actually needed, Major S... H. Longs we learn, was
a topographical Engineer of the Army and according to his map (Plain.
 l0) he explored zzruch of the area between the Arkansas and Red
rivers as early as 1817', so his observations, as contained in his

report, are entitled to much weig‘ ts having been reported so near the

1 Ind. Cl. Comm. 469 _ ' . 487

time the treaty was consummated.

.In reaching the conclusion that the Quapaw Tribe has failed to
prove aboriginal possession of the territory claimed in Count I of the
petition, we have not overlooked the statement contained in the treaty
commissioners‘ letter transmitting the 1818 treaty to the Secretary
of War (Plaintiffs3 Ex. 13), dated September 6, 1818, in which they
stated that the tract ceded “at all times heretofore has been considered
their property as well by the former governments as by the Osages their
neighbors.“ The quoted remark was not, perhaps, intended as an imiportant statement of fact but rather as emphasizing their success and
as an incidental reference to their impressions of the situation; however, there is no proof in the record to support any such remark. We,
therefore, cannot accept it as controlling our determination of Count
I.

Counsel for plaintiffs further urge upon us the fact that there
is no showing of any claim by any other tribe to the territory covered
by the treaty. It is true that there is no direct evidence of any’
other tribes claiming any part of the Qnapan cession, but there is
proof that other tribes occupied part of the area, such as the Caddo
and Wichita, and assuming it to be a fact that there were no Indian
claimants to the territory except the Quapaw, does it help the Quapam?
It has always been held that the fee title to lands occupied by Indian
tribes vested in the United States by virtue of discovery, (Johnson v.

Hclntosh (1823), 8 Wheat. 5143, 573-71;, 5 L. ed. 681, 688-9) and that

1 Ind. C1. Comm. 469 ' 488
._ 15 _ the Indian tribes only had the right of occupancy because of their
original and previous possession. United States v. Alcea, 329 U35.
HO. And it will be seen'by the quotations from the cases set forth
above that such occupancy must be actual and not merely constructive
or merely asserted. The result of all of the above is that actual
occupancy of the ceded land must be shown as any other fact and the
mere fact that no other tribe is shown to have claimed it, or a part
of it, does not dispense eith the necessity of proving exclusive possession in order to sustain a claim of original Indian title.
H The first Count of the petition must, therefore, be dismissed

and an order to that effect will be entered later.

COUNT II
In the second cause of action set forth in the petition (desiga
nated as Count II) the plaintiffs seekzrecovery of the value at $2.00
per acre of 1,153§60MO75 acres of land (hereinafter referred to as _
the reservation or the reserved land) which the plaintiff tribe ceded
to the defendant by the treaty of ncvenber=15, 182M (7 Stat. 232).
This land is located in what was then.Arkansas territory and is described in the treaty as follows:
Beginning at a point on the Arkansas river, opposite
to the Post of Arkansas” and running thence a due southn
west course to the Ouachita river; and thence,'up the same,
to the Saline Fork; and up the Saline Forkg to a point from
whence a due northeast course will strike the.arkansas river
A at Little Rock: and thence down the right (or south bank)

of the Arkansas river to the place of beginni 0.

and was the part reserved by the Qnapaw for their use from the vast

1 Ind. c1. com. 469   439   -— 16 territory they ceded to the defendant by the treaty of.August 2%, 1818
(7 Stat. 176) and which we have referred to above in considering the
first cause of action (Count i). llncidentally, it may be stated that
there is no disagreement between the parties as to the land covered

by the above description for the parties accept the land shown by
Plaintiffs‘ Exhibit 76_ and the map of Arlmnsas 1, mete cxn, contained
in Vol. 2, 18th Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology,
cession designation No. l2l, as the reserved land. (For description,
see finding No. M). This reference is the only way the descriptions
tcontained in the two treaties can be reconciled with the natural

boundaryacall on the southwest, that is, the river-boundary.

.The question of original Indian title to the reserved land is not
involved in the consideration of this claim, for we believe the Governe
ment in concluding the 1818 treaty intended to and did recognize the
Quapaw rights to the reserved land. This is shown, we think, by the
following undisputed facts: V

On february 6, 1818, wn. Clark, who became on the treaty Commissioners, wrote the Secretary of War, John C. Calhoun, about ex»
tinguishing the Quapaw claim to lands south of the Arkansas river, and
suggested the necessity of giving the treaty commissioner certain specific instructions, among which were for "reserving to the Quapaws for
their own use a.sufficient quantity, including their villages,“ and
“The terms on which the quantity reserved shall be held - whether as

tenants in common or shall they have power to divide it amongst them—

1 Ind. Cl. Comm. 469' t - . 490

....'.3_?...

selves, and the right to dispose thereof separately." He also mentions

the unwillingness of the Indians to sell the Hot Springs and a valuable
Salt Lick and suggests instructions be given as to reserving them;
.(Plaintifi‘s' Ex. 11).

Evidently acting upon the suggestion of Wm. Clark. the Secretary
of War on May 8. 1818, wrote a letter to "Gov. Wm. Clark and Aug.
Chouteau," with which he enclosed. “a commission- to you to treat with
the Quapaws," and instructed them as to their duties. He also instructed them as to the lands to be reserved for the Qnapaws as follows:
“The lands reserved for the Qtlapal-I must be held by the tenure by which
Indians usually hold their lands. as the Senate x-zonld. probably, ratify

no treaty which recognizes in the Indians the right of acquiring indi2.‘.

vidual property with the power of selling. except to the United States.

(Plain. Ex. 12). Here is revealed a purpose to recognize the rights

‘ ofthe Quapaw to whatever land may be reserved for their use by the

terms of the treaiar to be negotiated.

lhe treaty was agreed upon and executed thereafter on August .21},
1818. by which some 3-£3,000,000 acres of land were ceded to defendant
"with the exception and reservation following. that is to say":
(description of reserved land as set forth above) “which said tract of
land. last above designated and reserved. shall be suweyed and marked
off at the expense of the United States. as soon as the same can be
done with convenience, and shall not be sold or disposed of, by the

Qdapaw tribe or nation. or to any individual whatever. nor to any state

.. 18 .or nation, without the approbation of the United States first had and
obtained.“

The instructions given the treaty commissioners by a responsible I I
officer of the defendant, the reservation of the land and the restrictions as to the alienation thereof, which we have quoted in the
last preceding paragraph hereof, is, in our judgment, an express
recognition of the Indian rights to the area described as reserved

in the 1818 treaty. Obviously, the restraint against disposal by the

Quapaw of the reserved land would have been unnecessary if it  not

been intended to recognize that the Indians had rightsupon which the
restraint couldloperate. Again, it will be noted, that there was an

extinguishment of the Indian title and claim of title to all theplands

' described in the treaty, except those reserved. These indisputable

facts created a reservation as effectively as if the defendant had
ceded the reserved land to the Quapaw and it amounted, without question,
to a recognition of aboriginal possessory title in those Indians. Cf.
Sp-aiding v. Chandler, 160 11.5. 391+, 3-L03-1%; Minnesota v. Eitchock, 185
17.8. 373, ‘+90-13,91. In those cases the Supreme Court, in deciding

what was necessary to establish an Indian reservation, said that no

formal cession or act setting apart the reserved land was necessary

- if what was done resulted in an appropriation of a defined tract for

certain purposes.
In Gaines v. Nicholson, 9 How‘. 356, 13 L. ed. 172, the Supreme

Court was considering the rights growing-out of a treaty of cession

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 3469 r t 492

made by the Choctaw Nation to the United States (7 Stat. 333) by which
a section oi‘. land was reserved. to one Wall to be selected by him Hall
conveyed his right to select the section to Gaines who selected land
claimed under a school grant to the State of Mississippie In deciding
that Gaines had the prior right to the section the court said:
“He (Gaines) holdsg strictly speaking not under the
treaty of cession, but under his original title, confirmed
by the Government in the act of agreeing to the reservation. “The same principle applies to the reservation of the Quapaw, and the

act of the Government in agreeing to the reservation in the 1818 treaty

was a confirmation of the original title of the Indians to the reserved _

lands.

I __20_ in the Osage case, Docket No, 9, decided December 30, 19MB, we con»
sidered the meaning of the term “unconscionable consideration§ and
therein decided that, while unconscionable consideration is an incident
or circumstance of fraud and that fraud, and not inadequacy of consideration, is the true and only cause for equity intervention and the
granting of relief, there is a related rule which is stated in Eyre.

‘V. Potter, lH'U.S. #2, as follows: i

"Still, there may be such an unconscionableness or
inadequacy in a bargain, as to demonstrate some gross
imposition or some'undue influence; and in such cases
courts of equity ought to interfere, upon satisfactory
ground of fraud; but then, such.unconscionableness or
such inadequacy should be made out as would, to use an
expressive phrase, shock the conscience, and amount in
itself to conclusive and decisive evidence of fraud.“

.And following Eyre vs Potter, Supra, the Supreme Court decided the case
of Graffam v. Burgess, ll? U05, 180, which.was a suit to set aside a
judicial sale because of the gross inadequacy of the purchase price.
It there discussed the effect of gross inadequacy of_price, as follows:

”From.the cases here cited we may draw the general

conclusion that if the inadequacy of price is so gross

as to shock the conscience, or if in»addition to gross
inadequacy, the purchaser has been guilty of any unfairness, or has taken any undue advantage, or if the owner
of the property, or party interested in it, has been for
any other reason, misled or surprised, then the sale will
be regarded as fraudulent and void, or the party injured
will be permitted to redeem the property sold, Great in—
adequacy requires only slight circumstances of unfairness
in the conduct of the party benefited by the sale to raise
the presumption of fraud,

'Inadequacy of consideration, if it be of so gross a

‘nature as to amount in itself to conclusive and decisive
evidence of fraud, is a ground for canceling the transu
action.‘ Kerr, Fraud, Am, ed, 186. Chancellor Desaussure,
in the case of Butler v, Haskell, 4 Des, E51, 697, on the
same subject, says: ‘I consider the result of the great
body of the cases to be, that wherever the court perceives
that a sale of property has been made at a grossly inv
adequate price, such.as would shock:a correct mind, this
inadequacy'fnrnishes a strong and in general a conclusive
presumption, though there be no direct proof of fraud,
that an undue advantage has been taken of the ignorance,
the weakness, or the distress and necessity of the vendor;
and this imposes on the purchaser a necessity to remove
this violent presumption by the clearest evidence of the
fairness of his conduct.3 4

“It is true these observations, both.of Mr, Kerr and
Chancellor Desaussure, were made in reference to private
sales between parties and do not strictly apply to judicial
sales, But they show that great inadequacy of price is a

with suspicion, unless it appears by the circumstances of
the case, or by evidence, that it is no fault of the buyer,"

 

We are of the opinion that the facts shown in the record of this case
are governed by the rules so plainly stated above,

Our next_problem is to determine the consideration paid for the
Quapaw cession of the reserved area, In this cession, as stated above,
there were l,l63,60H,T5 acres, but by Article 6 of the treaty there
was reserved for one James Scull 1280 acres for payment of a debt owing
him by the Indians, and by Article 7, the United States was required
to grant eleven named "Indians by descent“ tracts of the reserve aggregating lOh0 acres, so deducting the 2320 acres from the entire area,
the defendant acquired by the cession l,l6l,284,75 acres of land free
of Indian title, According to the General accounting Office report

November 15, 1821}, in goods, services, payments to chiefs, annuities,

"etc., the sum of $28,037.00, about 2.1; cents per acre. ~The plaintiffs

concede that that amount represents the consideration paid by the
defendant (proposed Finding No. 7 and page 31 of Plaintiffs‘ brief)
for the cession, and we accept that figure; although we think it
doubtful whether certain items making up the amount, such as the sum
of 813140 for education, and a son of $380.83 for ammunition and cloth-ing, can be considered aspart of the purchase price paid under the
treaty; however, whether the consideration received by the Quapaw for
the cession of the reserved land by the treaty of November 15,, 1821},
was $28,037.00, or some lesser sum, is of no consequence for if that
amount was the only sum paid it was grossly inadequateg based upon
the value of eighty-five cents per acre as we have determined the
value to be.

But the government contends that the treaty of May 13, 1833, 7
Stat. 1421}, was, by its express provisions, or at least in effect, a
treaty supplemental to the 1821; treaty, hence, the value of the benefits the Quapaw derived from the later treaty should be added to the
$28,03'{oOO they received under the former treaty and the total sum
be considered as the amount received by the Indians for the 1821+
cession. The total consideration, as computed by the government, is
as follows: Amount paid Indians under 1821+ treaty? $28,0_'57.,OQ;
amount received by the Indians under the 1833 treaty, $252,,1+'{1+.,05, or

a total of $280,511.05, to which should be added the value of 82,808.23

1 Ind. C1. Comm. 469 0 496

- 23 _

acres of land conreyed to the Qnapaw as required by Article II of the
1833 treaty, and the sum of $39,575.31, (See Def, proposed Finding

No. 13, p, 120 and p. 151 of Brief). It should ‘be explained here

that under Article II of said treaty the defendant agreed to convey
96,000 acres (150 sections) of land but actually conveyed only 82,808.23
acres, so ‘by the Act of March 3, 1891, 26 stat, 989, 998 (P0 395 of
Def. Ex. 90) defendan-t appropriated and paid the ooapae $39,575.31 in
lieu of the land shortage,.i§here has been no proof as to the value

of the 82,808,23 acres of land,

As we compute the total amounts paid under the 1833 treaty, we
reach the following: Total amount paid, which includes the sum of
$39,M23o03 for the 13,191.77 acres not conveyed, was the sum of
$281L,6'{8,‘{5, (See item (c) p, 7 and pp. so to 90, to and including
item 8,58, GoA.0..Report, Def, Ex, 90). So, on the basis.0f the
Governmentis contention, the Quapaw received the sum of $28,037.00
under the 1821+ treaty and the sun of $281t,678,75 under the 1833 treaty,
a total of $312,715.75, plus the 82,808.23 acres of land. This difh
ference, however,'between the Governmentis figures and ours is not of
importance here because we do not consider any of the items paid under
the 1833 treaty as part of the consideration for the 182% cession,

The importance of determining the real consideration for the 1828
cession is, of course, to gauge the disparity between consideration
‘paid the Qnapaw and the value of the land ceded so that the Commission

may decide whether the consideration was unconscionable,

1 Ind. cl. Comm. 469 497
...21t...

We shall now emmine the treaty of 1833 to determine whether the

substantial benefits derived by the Qnapaw thereunder should be taken
into consideration in deciding whether the paments for the cession
of the reserved land was unconscionable.

The treaty of May 13, 1833, 7 Stat. #21}, was made nearly nine
years after the treaty of November 15, 18274, 7 Stat. 232. By Article
it of the 1821i treaty the Quapat: were to be consolidated with and form
a part of the Caddo Indians. No specific land was assigned to them

g by the United States and, it is shown by the recitals in and Article
I of the 1833 treaty, that whatever Caddo land they obtained was given
them.by the Caddo. It was this Caddo land. whatever it was. that was
conveyed to the United States (Art. I) for l50 sections of land in
northeast Oklahoma and southeast Kansas (Art. II). Here was an exchange of land to provide a permanent home for the Quapaw. as was
evidently contemplated.by the 182% treaty.

Article III of the 1833 treaty provided for paying the cost of
removing the Indians to their new home, supplying provisions and
furnishing them with equipment, livestock. educational advantages,
eto., so they could follow agricultural pursuits. are by article 1+
of the treaty the Indians waived their annuities, one, perpetual, in
the sum of $1000.00 payable under the treaty of Allgtlst 21+, 1818, 7
State 176, and the balance of a limited annuity payable under the
said treaty of lean, for the sum of $ulso.oo. And the Government by

this Article agreed to pay laborers $1000 to build houses and to pay

llnd. Cl. Comm. h6.90r- . ' 498

the Quapaw $2000 per year for 20 years.

Article V of the treaty reads in part:

"It is hereby agreed, and expressly understood, that

this treaty is only supplementary to the treaty of 182M,

and designed to carry into effect the views of the United

States in providing a permanent and comfortable home for

the Qnapaw Indians“;

It is this language the defendant stresses as showing that the l833
treaty was in reality a part of the 182M treaty. We do not so consider
it. The 182% treaty was complete and fully executed, except for paying
the last two or three annuities which were included in the 1833 annuity
settlement. (Art. Iv). It was by thel821+ treaty that the Indian
rights to the reserved land passed to the United States, and for the
consideration therein expressedg claimed by plaintiffs to be $28,037.00.
Thus, the 182M treaty was complete and final and nothing contained in
the 1833 treaty added.anything to the transfer of title to the cession

. of l82§, nor was it necessary to add anything for by Article I of the
182M treaty the Qnapaw expressly ceded "all claim or title which they
may have” to the reserved lands.

No doubt some of the benefits which innred to the profit of the
Indians under the 1833 treaty may?properly be set off against the award
to be made claimant, however, such offsets can and will only be considered when subnitted, Our conclusion is, accordinglyg that only the
sum of $28,037.00 may be regarded as the consideration in determining

the question whether it constitutes an unconscionable consideration

under our Acts

Veare next confronted with the perplexing and sometimes elusive
.l problem of determining the value of the reserved land as of the date
of the cession, November 15, 1823. Alcoa etc. v. United States, 103
Go Cls. 491+. Technically, perhaps, the treaty of cession did not be-H
come effective until February 19, l825,' the date it was proclaimed by

the President, but our conclusions will be the same whichever date is

considered the proper one.

In determining values it seems that the Federal Courts early
adopted and have consistently followed the concept .of "market value”
‘as a practical standard to be applied in the ordinary case. United
States v. Miller, 317 ms. 369, 87 L. ed. 336; United States v. Toronto,
911- L. ed. 162. While these cases relate to property appropriated for
public pnuposes the rule seems to apply to all cases where land value
rnust be determined for, as said in Mississippi and  River Boom
company v. Patterson, 98 ms. 1:03, 25 L. ed. 206:

“In determining the value of land appropriated for
jpublicpurposes, the same considerations are to be regarded

as in a sale of property betxizeen private parties. The inquiry in such cases must be what is the property worth in

the market, viewed not merely with reference to the uses to

which it is at the time applied, but with reference to the

uses to which it is plainly adapted; that is to say, what

is it worth from its availability for valuable uses?”

It may be said that there are no inflexible rules governing the
evidence that is admissible to prove market value of land, however,
3-3 has been said, “the value of property at a given time depends upon

the relative intensity of the social desire for it at that time, exp

Pmssed in the money 11-. would bring in the market.“ It is particularly

1 Ind” c1. Comm. 469 _ 500 difficult to fix land values in cases involving vast areas of Indian
lands as of a time-over 125 years ago in this case--when the lands
were occupied by aborigines living in a primitive state and making but

limited use of them and prior to which time there had been no sales

i in the ceded area by which value may be gauged. In such circumstances

we must, to a large extent at least, examine transactions involving
land sales, both public and private, in the area in question  in
the vicinity thereof, near the time at which the value ‘must be determined,
the year 1821!. i
There is a wide divergence of opinion between the parties as to
the value of the reserved land. The plaintiffs (proposed Finding 115,
p. 91 of their Brief) fix it at $2.00 per acre, while the defendant
(proposed Finding 20, p. 136 of Brief) fixes it at five cents per acre.
The- reserved lands are located in perhaps the most fertile part
of Arkansas. The area abounds in alluvial bottoms, the soils of which

are largelysandy or silty loan and suitable for raising crops of all

grains‘, corn, and cotton, without the -aid of artificial irrigation,

since the annual precipitation runs 1&5 to 55 inches. The altitude in
the area ranges from 100 feet to about 300 feet above sea level. While
the bottom lands in some portions of the region are timbered}, timber
does not appear to be a factor of any importance in valuing the lands.
Arkansas was slow in settling. This was due to some extent to

the threat of locating Indians from east of the Mississippi river to

regions west of that river, but at the time of the Qnamw cession of

1 1nd.'c1. Com. 469 - * _ 501
«-28 8183}, the only substantial Indian holdings were those of the Choctaw,
the Cherokee and the Caddo. The Choctaw held a large area between the
Bed and Arkansas rivers, and the Cherokee, north of the Arkansas river,
in the western part of the Arkansas territory, and the Caddo held. a
comparatively small area in the southwest corner; however, the Choctaw
ceded all their lands the next year (treaty of January 20, 1825, 7 Stat.
237+) after the Quapaw cession of the reserved lands in 1821+; and the
Cherokee lands were ceded in 1828, 7 Stat, 311. So, when the reserved
lands were made availablefor settlement there were no Indians in the
territory except the Caddo, and they ceded the small area claimed by
them in 1835. (Treaty of July 1, 1835, 7 Stat. #70).

A large volume of evidence has been submitted by both sides bearing -upon the value of the reserved lands, a large part of which consists of sales, both public and private, of land within the territory, a
and later, the State of Arkansas, beginning as early as 1801}, and of
sales within the reserve after it was opened for settlement. To
attempt to review this great mss of evidence would extend this opinion
beyond reasonable bounds, so we shall content ourselves with referring
to only such parts thereof as may throw light on our conclusions as
to value, although we have given consideration to all the evidence
offered by the parties,

iiiere has been no attempt by either party to this proceeding to
classify the specific land included in the Quapaw reserve, nor do the

various public and private sales shown in the evidence indicate the

1 Ind. Cl. Comm. 469 - 1 502
a 29 a '

character of the lands covered thereby or the character or value of
the improvements on tracts sold at private sale, so, in order to
determine the value of iahas involved in private sales, the plaintiffs
consider one—half of the land value represents improvements, such as
buildings, wells, fences, etc., and implements, machinery and livestock. (See Plaintiffs‘ proposed Findings 7o~77, p, 66 of Brief).
.Plaintiffs have prepared elaborate exhibits (103-106, 108-111,
113-118) showing the consideration.paid for tracts of land conveyed
by private parties, as shown by the public records of Arkansas,
Pulaski, Eempstead and Independence counties in the Arkansas areal
during the period from 180M to 1826. These conveyances did not, in
the main, pretend to convey the title to land but merely conveyed
whatever rights the seller had, including improvements, if any, and
in order to arrive at a land value the plaintiffs added the minimum
government price at the time, either $1.25 or $2.00 per acre, to the
consideration named in the instrument shown in the record, By this
method it was determined (Plaintiffs! hr, 118) that the average per
acre value of the lands in those four counties was as follows:
Pulaski, from 1815 to 182M,» $ 1.91
Hempstead, from 1818 to 1826,» $.3,18
Independence, from 1819 to 182%,» $ .89
Arkansas, from 1806 to 1826,» 8 2,29
While'under Spanish sovereignty, the Spanish governors made lavish

grants of land in the south to individuals; many of the transfers

1 ma. c1. Comm. 469 _ - -1 503

referred to above included claims based upon Spanish grants. The
consideration shown in these conveyances was usually small and in
Arkansas County the average purchase_price for all lands listed,
which would include Spanish grant lands; was found to he fiftyuseven
cents per acre. (Plaintiffs‘ Ex. 118).

Public land sales in the Territory of Arkansas began in 1821
when the first sales were.he1d at Little.Rock, which was the Land
Office nearest the reserve. In that year only 560 acres were sold;
in 1822, 23,161 acres; in 1823, 2282 acres; and 2978 acres in 182%;
in the entire Territory, and the sales for the years 1825 to 1829
were slow. (see Def, Ex. 91, pp. 3l;—35). Sales of public lands
throughout.Arkansas between 1821 and 1838 aggregated lO6;85M acres
and brought an arerage price of $1.535 per acre, and these sales
included lands south of the Arkansas in.the Quapaw cession (Def.
Ex. 91: pp. 60-61).

Sales of land in the Quapaw reserve are more informative.
Defendant's Exhibit No. 21 includes a tabulation of cash entries
of Quapaw reserve lands from 1831 to 1925 and the sums paid therefor.
The first sales were made in 1831 during which year only MM? acres
were sold out of 138,h05 acres offered, During the next three years
the sales aggregated but 2227 acres, and in 1835 a total of 8591
acres were sold, but it was not until 1836 that there was any sub—

stantial demand when the cash entries jumped.up to a total of

1 Ind. C1. Comm. 469 t 504

..31l...

76,026 acres for that year. The tabulation shows that between the
years 1831 and 185k, inclusive, 130,691 acres of the reserve were
sold for $16u,2o1.7o,_er $1.25h per acre, and from 1855 to 1861,
327, 665 acres were sold for $l90,91}7.,8O, or about 58 cents per acre.
As we have indicated above, we are ‘dealing with a vast area of

land, over 1,000,000 acres in one body, which varies as to quality,

‘suitability for farming or other use, and in many other ways which a

prospective ‘buyer would consider in purchasing a small part of it.
So, because of the very extent (if the area, it is impracticable to
require a classification of _the land, as may be done in cases involving tracts‘ the size of ordinary farms, in order to fix the market

W‘~.--_1.e for we mist, .....cm .._.., .0... * ..........';..... 13.1. su..a.I..r .LJ..Lq_-<.A..L&J’ LLG and p .o.

transactions involving a number of small tracts in and near the area
and within a reasonable time of the acquisition. There has, because
of the magnitude of the task, ‘been no attempt to classify the lands
sold at public and private sales. Under the conditions confronting us,
we must take the only proof available after a lapse of a century and
8. quarter, and we reach the conclusion that the reserved land had, at
the time of the cession, a market valueofi $9S'{9092.00.,

rhea the above, it follows that the plaintiffs are entitled to
an award in the sum of $987,092.00 less such offsets, if any, as may
hereafter be allowed in accordance with section l2 of the General Rules
of Procedure of the Commission,
