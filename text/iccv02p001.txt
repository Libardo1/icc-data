claim for $30,000,000. plus interest. being the value of 249,800
acres of land described in the petition and located in what is now

lands until January 22. 1855. when petitioner. and ten other tribes.‘

ceded a large area ofiland including petitioner's. to defendant

(12 Stat. 92?) for the completely‘ inadequate and unconscionable Iconeideration of $150,000. oi’. which amount petitioner was entitled and.

Thus it would appear that whatever of the Lummi lands were taken
under said act were those aboriginally held by that tribe.

_ to the three treaties mentioned in the Jurisdictional act and by

its Finding XIII, found that the boundaries of the territory occupied

‘by the tribes were not established by the record. and then proceeded
to find that in the areas claimed by the tribespwho were parties to
the three treaties‘ quantities of land were settled upon by white

 settlers. and with respect to the Lumi tribe. it made this finding

(Def. Ex. 3):

\ '—   L s In the country claimed to have been occupied by

._ .3 the hi tribe. settlements were made upon 2,406.05
' i_;  acres prior to the conclusion of this treaty and upon

926.26 acres between the dates of the conclusion and
ratification of the treaty. The settlement certificates and patents for these lands were all issued sub‘ “:;”'§ sequent to the date of the ratification of the treaty.

 It is not clear from the finding whether this land was settled on

' f it _T-:__< f under the Oregon Donation Act or under that not and others mentioned

in Finding XII of the court. but we assume it was taken under that

' Act since the court seems to so regard it in its opinion. In any
event. the court disposed of the Lumrni claim. and the others. by
these statements contained in the opinion of the court found in
79 C. Cls. 530:

At pages 569-70 (Def. Ex. 11-) the court said:

the D11-ramish. Izummi. Whidby Island Slmgit, Samish.
C . Snohmish. Puyallup. and Squaxin Tribes insist that a
proven claim exists for payment at the rate of five
dollars an acre for 514': 955.24 acres patented to applicants under the Oregon Donation Act. It is established
that portions of the lands occupied. and roamed over by
the plaintiff Indians were taken as claimed. The impediment to _a recovery is not only confined to an impossibility of ascertaining with any degree of accuracy
the extent of the loss suffered by each tribe. but to
_ the additional fact that the boundaries of the tribes are
incapable of being definitely or approximately fixed so
as to enable the Interior Department to ascertain what

if any portion of the patented lands falls within the
lands occupied by the respective tribes.

And after discussing a map offered to show boundaries of the tribal

lands and concluding it {was inadequate, the court at the\bottom of

page 570 said:

A careful and deliberate study of the record
exhibits the necessity of basing the claimed loss

. upon an approximation which would of itself be simply
a finding without a basis of fact. This we cannot do.

And on page 571i the court in discussing its jurisdiction stated:

' the defendant challenges our jurisdiction to adjudicate
any of plaintiffs‘ claims which arose prior to the execution

of the treaties of 1855. * * 3' The act (jurisdictional act)

"' * ‘V is limited to claims growing out of the three treaties
mentioned. and omits a provision for a recovery of any sums

growing out of acts of Congress.

The acts of Congress thus referred to obviously include the Oregon

Donation Act. in fact. that is the only act the court had discussed

prior to the statement quoted above.

Following th last quotations

the court cites and quotes from Price v. United States, et al, 171+
U. S. 373. which case held that the Court of Claims‘ jurisdiction

was limited by the jurisdictional act and that the Government‘s

liability cannot be extended beyond the plain language of the statute

. ? 64- authorizing the suit. So it is apparent that the court concluded

‘that it had no Jurisdiction to determine the alleged losses due to

vthe taking of the claimants‘ lands under the Congressional.Act

known as the Oregon.Donation.Act.

The final determination.of the court was to allow*the Indian
tribes for breaches of the treaty and nothing for the loss of land
through Congressional aotion. A.reading of the opinion convinces
us that the reason.for not allowing recovery for the land taken.was
because the court was of the opinion the Jurisdictional act did not
permit an adjudication for the land appropriated by white settlers

or granted the states, through Congressional action. It*is, of course.

p true, as defendant's counsel has pointed out and as we have set forth .

above. that the court in its findings determined the acreage taken

"',_ from the various claimants. including the Lunmi. in.the respective

V lareas claimed by then. but it also found that the boundaries of the

respective areas occupied by then.was not established (Finding XIII).
and that fact was declared in the opinion as an impediment to recovery.
It seems to us that all the court intended was to show that even if

it had Jurisdiction to consider the land claims —- the ones pleaded

as well as those not pleaded but upon which.evidenoe was offered it could.make no award therefor because of the failure of proof as

to boundaries.

He conclude, therefore. that the Governnnt's defense of res

Judicata must be denied. Smith v. Hcheal. 109 U. 3. 425.
