that u at is presently ‘I.-znown as the San Juan Tribe is composed of

descendants of more than one group of.‘ Indians who resided in the general
area, including Vancouver Island as well as the Bellingham Bay area.

6. Historically there is no mention of a San Juan Tribe in the
area. The reports of early explorers fail to make any mention of such
a group, although all oi‘ the other resently recognized groups were reported at one time or .=.._'"'=other.

7. The San Juan Tribe of Indians participated in the case of

 

Doc.-.e...i..:‘r:, at a].., V. The United States, 79 C. Cls. 530, as a non-treaty
The issue of fact as to their identifiability was passed on by

the Court in the follc*.r.‘L?.ng language:

The decision of the issue of fact (i.e., identifiability
of the San Juan Tribe) is, if we are correct as to the status
oi‘ the non-treaty tribes, unimportant. However, if we are not
correct, the record does disclose such a preponderant doubt
as to tribal statusoi‘ these Indians that we would be unable
to find that they constituted what was know.-n as a separate
and distinct Indian tribe, but acquired a name due more to
location of their villages upon ‘the San Juan Islands, in association with other tribes of the same locality, and it is not
disputed that the San Juan Islands were within the territory
ceded to the United States in the Point mliott Treaty of.‘ 1855.

"'2:

8. It appears frcna the evidence that the San Juan Tribe of Indians

are composed, at least in part, of .descer.dants and successors in interest. A

oi‘ the Lunzni Indians and the Samish Irnians, both of whom have filed

claims 'mi'ore this Cozrrnission. Those descendants of the Lumrni Indians

are presuzned to be eligible to share in any ;'.‘eCOV’3I‘:,«' ‘--'l":ich may be had
under the findings and ooinion rendered this day by the Commission in

the case of The L--:::::i Tribe of Indians v. The United states, Docket No.

   

13.0.
Those San Juan Indians of Sanish descent are presumed to be able
to share any recovery’ srhich might be had under Docket No. 261, The

Samish Tribe of Indians v. The United States.

9. Based upon the preceding findings and the evidence of record

in the consolidated cases, Docket 110 and Docket 2111, it is the finding

this Commission that petitioners in this case, Docket 21);, The San

Juan Tribe of Indians T4’. The United States, have failed to establish

   

that they are the descendants or successors in interest of any identiQ

fiaole tribe, band or gmup of Indians who, aboriginally and~up to
1855, held Indian title to any defirble area of land within or near the
area claimed.
