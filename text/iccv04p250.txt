The Commission makes the following findings of fact which are
supplemental to findings numbered 1 through 8 made in the prior
decision of this Commission:

9. The land involved in this oeneeis a strip along the southern
border of the Lower Brule Reservation in South Dakota. As indicated
in the previous findings, there was an error in the survey as made in
1890 and as a result thereof the 1+hthpe.:=e,11e1 of latitude, which was
officially designated as the souther boundary of the Lower Brule
Reservation in the Act of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888, was incorrectly
located and resulted in a loss of a portion of the Lower Brule lands
as described in the Act of March 2, 1889c

10. The correct location of the Hhth parallel is 5.16“ feet south

of the nonumented south boundary of the Lower Brule Reservation. The

._..

area of land erroneously excluded from said reservation is hl.88? miles
long, 0.978 of a.mile wide and contains hO.965 square miles. This calm
culation was made by the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (Def. Ex. 29}.
ll. The excluded land constitutes parts of Township 106 N., Ranges
73. 7“. 75. 76. 77. 78 and 79 West of the 5th Principal Meridian, South
Dakota, and to determine the acreage thereof the Bureau of Land Management located on copies of the official plats of said townships the hhth
parallel as determined by the Coast and Geodetic Survey and computed the
acreage of the fractional quarter section north of the Nhth parallel.
(Def.'Exs. 27 (d) (e). 31-37). The total acreage as shown by these plats

is 25.968.2n and we find it the correct acreage of the excluded area.

Note - The tabulation of disposals within the excluded area as shown
by defendant's Exhibit 28 shossa total acreage of 26.235.56. but this
total. as a comparison with said exhibits 31-37 will show, includes

lands lying south of the hhth parallel. And, as to computation of
25,218 acres made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey (Def. Ex. 29) it

will be observed that such acreage was “based upon a standard section

of 640 acres.”

12. By the Act of March 2, 1889 (25 Stat. 888) it was provided
in Section 21, "That all the lands in the Great Sioux Reservation,
Outside of the separate reservations herein described are hereby
restored to the public domain ° * *5“

The act provided in Sec. 28, that it should become effective
upon proclamation by the President. The Presidential Proclamation was
issued on February 10, 1890 (26 Stat. l5§*). The act further provided
in Sec. 21. "that all lands herein opened to settlement under this act
remaining undisposed of at the end of ten years from the taking effect
of this act shall be taken and accepted by the United States and paid
for by said United States at fifty cents per acre * * 3. And said
lands shall thereafter be part of the public domain * *.” The Commission, therefore, finds that the date the Indian title to this excluded land passed to defendant was February 10, 1900, and is valued
as of that date.

13. The area of land to be valued herein lies approximately in
the south—central part of the state of South Dakota and in the county
of Lyman. It is adjacent to the southern border of the Lower Brule
Indian Reservation. The southeast corner of the line representing the
beginning of the south border of the tract of land is located 7.75

dates usually run between May 5 and 10, in the spring. and September 30

to October 5, in the fall. The temperature range is fairly extreme and

may go from over 100° in the summer to ~30° in Winte?o The aVeT889 Fain“
fall in Lyman County is 18 inches and is about the lowest in the state.
However, the major portion of the rainfall comes iuring the growing season.

The only drainage in the area is furnished by Meiicine Creek and its

branches. The water supply for the area comes from rainfall, shallow

wells, reservoirs and occasional artesian wells. In 1903, there were only

three artesian wells in Lyman County. One of these was on the Lower Brule

Reservation and two were north of Oacoma. Trees are scarce through the

area, with what there are being confined to the stream banke.. The trans»
portation for this area was furnished by the Missouri River prior to the

railroads. The Missouri is 12 miles east of the eastern end of the strip

and 55 miles from its western end. By 1880 there was a railroad at Pierre.

South Dakota. on the eastern side of the Missouri. This was about 36 air

miles from the western end of the area and 59 air miles from the eastern

end. By 1890, there was a line to Chamberlain on the eastern side of

the Missouri.* This line was about 26 miles from the eastern end of the

strip and 68 miles from the western end. It nasn‘t until 1905, that the

railroads began to extend nest of the Missouri. pnbout 57% of the present

rail network was available up until 1905. This meant that some 1900

miles of line east of the Missouri was in operation.

16. The soils within the area are capable of supporting grass for

grazing purposes and also small grains and corn. There is approximately

65% of the soil which is adaptable to small grain and corn and about

35%'which is usable only for grazing. That would seem to indicate that

some 16,889 acres would have as its highest and best use the raising of
small grain and corn; while 9,079 acres were adaptable as grazing lands

However, the appraisers agree that the highest and best use for

only.
the lands as of 1890-1900 was for grazing lands.

1?. The area around Lyman County was originally devoted to cattle

raising because of the grassland. It wasn't until the advent of the railroads after 1905 that farming began to supplement and replace the cattle
industry on any scale. The area of Lyman County was 3,956 square miles

and it had a population of 2,632 in 1900. Nearly all of the towns in the
county were founded around 1905 when the railroad came west of the Missouri

River. The population in Lyman County increased from 233 in 1890 to 2,632
in 1900, because of the opening of the Sioux lands for settlement. During
this same period, the population of the town of Chamberlain, which was a

railroad terminal town on the east side of the Missouri, decreased from

932 to 8714. Local inhabitants explained the drop by saying that there

was nothing there for the people; that the banks had no money and

economic conditions were such that the people left. While the general

population of Lyman County was increasing between 1890 and 1900,_the

settlement within the excluded area was meager. For the period from

February 10. 1390 to February 10. 1893, homesteaders took up only 276.20

acres at $1.25 per acre. From February 10. 1893 through February 10,

1895, they took up 922.86 acres at 75¢ an acre, and from 1895 through
February 10, 1900. they took up 652.80 acres at 50¢ an acre; making a
total acreage homesteaded for the 10-year period of 1851.36 acres (Def.

Ex. 2? (a3). None of this land had gone to patent by 1000. and final

certificates were had on only 323.50 acres. (Def. EX. 2? (b)).

18. The general economic conditions between the years 1890 and

1900 were bad. The depression of the early 1890's was serious and

South Dakota was plagued with a serious water shortage during most of

the area were such that thousands left the state after defaulting on

mortgages. In 1890, the Indian troubles in South Dakota were extremely

serious and led to uprisings in which death and damage were considerable.
However. from 1895 on, the country began to shake off the grip of

time, the rate of interest on money ran to as much as 36§jper year.

From statistics quoted in defendant's Exhibit 38. it does not appear

that there was any considerable change in the farner‘s economic condition
which would tend to cause any great increase in the value of the land

under consideration from 1890 to 1900. The previous decade had been

One of prosperity for the farmers until the droughts of 1886, 1887 and
1889, and when the depression of the 1890's came along and with it the
drought years of that decade there was a wholesale abandonment of homesteads and mortgage foreclosures which causes a demand for legislative
relief.

19. There were few comparable sales within the area under consideration between 1890 and 1900. The defendant's appraiser mentions in his
report a study of private sales in the counties of Lake, Miner, Sanborn,
Jerauld, Buffalo, Brule. Lyman. Stanley, Hughes, and Sully, which, he
says. are areas adjacent or close to the subject area. He states that
most transfers were for 160 acres, more or less, and values ranged from
$80900 to $1600.00 (50¢ to $10.00 per acre)o The average sales for all
these counties indicated a consideration of $300 to $500 per quarter
section, more or less, or an average value of $2.33 per acre: However.
all of these counties with the exception of Lyman lie to the east of the
Missouri hiver and are not particularly comparable lands because of the

earlier settlement, better land, and railway development. Since the

.appraisal report lumped these counties together, there is no way to

separate whatever sales there may have heen during this period in the
area west of the Missouri. The appraisal report does mention that in
Brule and Buffalo counties, which are east of the Missouri, during the
1880's there were many delinguent tax sales where quarter sections were
sold for $15.00 to $25.00, and that the records reveal no noticeable

variance between the period of the l880‘s and 183055. At this same time,
there were millions of acres of public lands opened to homesteaderso

There were some nine million acres in the Great Sioux Reservation alone,

which.had been opened in 1890. Of this ceded area only 1,033.72? acres

had been entered during the ten years up to and including February 10.
1900, and this acreage included 135,826 acres of Indian allotments
authorized by the Treaty of April 29, 1868, 15 Stat. 635. and confirmed
by the March 2, 1889 agreement, leaving 7.261.592 acres of unappropriated Sioux lands outside the reserves. With only 1,851 acres of the
excluded land being settled during this loayear period, it would seem

that the demand therefor was not great.

20. The conclusion of defendant's appraiser, Mr. Arneson. based

upon the various factors considered by him and set forth in his appraisal
report (Def. Ex. 38). is that the value of the tract as a unit would have
been 63¢ per acre in 1890 and 67¢ in 1900.

21. Petitioner relied upon the testimony of two witnesses. Mr. Sharpe
and Mr. Williamson. Mr. Sharpe testified that in his opinion the total
area, as a unit, was worth.$h?2,700. He broke this figure down into $7.50
to $10.00 per acre for grazing land, with a mean of $7.75 and $10.00 to

$15.ooeper acre for cultivable land, with a mean of $12.50. He also
testified that he appraised some 80,320 acres to arrive at that figure.
He classified 32.000 acres as cultivable land at $12.50 per acre and
8.320 acres as grazing lands at $8.75 per acre. This figure would have
to be adjusted to compensate for the difference in acreage. Mr. Williamson
assigned a.value of $5.00 an acre to the grazing land and $8.00 to $10.00
an acre to the good farming land. There was no over-all value assigned
to the area.by Mr. Williamson, although he did classify the whole area.
22. There were no mineral resources in the area that send have

affected its value as of 1900.

E 25?

23. From a consideration of the entire record we find that the

excluded lands had a fair market value as a body of seventy-five cents
per acre as of February 10, 1900, and sixtyufive cents per acre as of
February 10, 1890. We, accordingly, find that the plaintiffs are
entitled to an award of $19,h76.1s, being the value of 25.96s.2h acres
at seventyufive cents per acre, less such offsets or counter-claims
the defendant may be entitled to under the Indian Claims Commission

Act.
