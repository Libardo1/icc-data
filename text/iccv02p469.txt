OPINION OF EHE COMMISSION

 

VWZTT, Chief Commissioner, delivered the opinion-of the Commission.

On August 22, 1949, petitiot§:40«B, C, D, E, and F were filed
with the Indian Claims Commission by "Robert Dominic, et a1., as the
representatives and on behalf of all members by blood of The Ottawa
Qribe of Indians,“ asserting, either as the purported successors to,
or on behalf of The Ottawa Tribe, claims based on the Treaties of
August 3, l795,.Ju1y 4, 1805, November 17, 1807, September 29, 1817,
aad August 29, 1821.

On July 6, 1951, the petition in case No. 133 was filed, captioned

lira‘

in white the petitioners assert, either as the purported successors

to, or on behalf of The Ottawa Tribe, claims based on the Treaties-of
July 4, 1805, November 17, 1807, September 29, 1817, and August 29,

identifiable group of Indians as is contemplated by Section 2 of the
Indian Claims Commission Act.

The essence of sch pleadings on the part of the petitioners in
these cases was the presentation or identical claims by two separate
groups contending to have the sole right to bring said actions for
the Ottawa Tribe, with the petitioners in case No. 133 further contending that the Ottawas of'Michigan, or their descendants, who were
known as the Ottawas and Chippewas of Michigan, and the Ottawas belonging t the United $ribes of Chippewas, Ottawas and Pottawatomies,
were not, or are not, members of the Ottawa Tribe.

In View of these pleadings the defendant, on September 26, 1951,
filed a motion for a preliminary hearing before the Commission, setting

Zndiaas oecu.red in l6l5, in what is now Canada, when they were

visited by one Samuel de Champlain. With reference to them he wrote

other early writers did not refer to the ttawas as a rule as a

sin le tribe, but rather mentioned several tribes, nations, or bands

found originally, testified that Indians did not have a head
chief who was recognised as a chief over all separate beads at any

time; that each band had a separate chief. He further testified
they had no continuous standing council, but that on occasions dii

eat groups of Ottawas would send their representative to meet with

2 473

2 &74

other representatives.

tee Ottawa Indians, at the close or the American Revolution,
were scattered over an immense territory, constituting what are now
knorn as the States of Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Illinois.
There were Ottawas in the northwestern section of the lower peninsula of Michigan; along the Maumee River and its tributaries in

Ohio; and some ttawas had even foun tneir way into southern Wis~consin and northeastern Illinois. There were no political ties between the several groups of Ottawas. Although the Indians named in
the-caption and the body of these treaties are referred to as constituting the Ottawa Nation or Tribe, it would seem that such designation
was as stated by the witness Kinietz more of a "grandiose flattering"
of the Endian group rather than a designation of a political entity.
As further stated by said witness, those who were parties to a

treaty were only those groups of Ottawas who were occupying or
claiming tne territory ceded.

The evidence is thought to definitely sustain the defendant's
Contention that all the Ottawa Indians were not, since known by the
white man, members of an Ottawa Nation which embraced within its
authority all bands and groups of Gttawas, and that there was no recognized entity as on Ottawa Nation (comprising all Ottawas) owning, or
claiming to own, or ceding lands.

That there was no recognized single entity as an Ottawa Nation,

but that the so-called nation consisted of separate entities in the

nature of bands or groups of Ottawas is confirmed by the conduct of

the parties to the treaties involved in these claims. While the
several treaties set aside reservations for the "Ottawa Nation” within the ceded area, and no reservation was set aside to any specific
giouo, the evidence shows that only the groups joininr ‘n the cession
thereafter occueied the reservations provided by any treaty; and subsequent cessions of these reservations were made to the United States
only by the groups joining in the treaties which provided for said
reservation .

The annuities provided for the so-called nation by the treaties
involved seem to have been paid to specific bands in'varying pro0

“Cttawas of Miami, B1anohard’s Fork, and Roche de Boeuf, $2,600.”

After 1853 no more annuities were gaid to the "0ttawas on Grand River,”

2 475

2 476 
and all payments made were to the " ttawas of Miami, B1anchard's Fork,
and Roche de Bocuf." In this connection, it is to be noted that on
July 31, 1855, a treaty was made with ”Ottawas and Chippewas", under
the terms of which "the tcawa and Chippewa Indians" released to th
United States all annuities accruing under previous treaties and the
Cttawas accepted in lieu of said annuities "the sum of $35,000, in
10 annual installments of $3,500 each, to be paid only to the Grand
River Gttawas."

These Accounting Office records show, therefore, that beginning
with the year 1821 the United States Government recognized as due
and owing to the .ttawas on Grand River $700 by reason of annuities
accruing to them under a treaty or treaties executed prior to the
treaty of August 29, 1821; and as accruir“ to them, the total annuity
provided by the treaty of August 29, 1821, until they released such
annuity, together with the previously entitled amount of $700, by
the treaty of 1855; and that the United States Government recognized
the treaties of 1821 and 1855 as dealing with and affecting only the
Ottawas on Grand River.i1

Attention is called to the fact that in the discussions prior to
the execution-of the treaty of 1821, Kewaygushcam, an Ottawa Chief of
the rand River Band, complained that his group had not received any
portion of the annuities accruing by reason of the previous Ottawa
treaties. His attention was called to the fact that he had received
5300 (probably meaning $700) the previous year, which he:mknbwledged;

and that for all subse uent ears until the release of 1855 the Grand

treaty. However, when this Chief made this protest he referred ;o the

Endians on the Maumee having sold “their lands." He also made the

Chigpeways, the Pottawatomies, and the Ottaways

ttention is also called to the fact that the release in evidence,

and St. Mary's, payable to the Ottawa Indians of Grand River and
also (of) $1,000, being the annuity due.to the said Indians by the
treaty of Chicago, both the said sums being for the year 1822."

the receipt dated the 29th day of August, 1822, is recited as being
signed by the "chiefs of the Ottaway Nation of Indians residing on
the Miami River and Blanchards Forks," of $3,600, "being a full and
fair division to us of the ttawa annuity for the year one thousand
eight hundred and twenty two."

This entire record indicates that there was no chief of the
entire nation, nor general council of the entire nation of Ottawas
having control over any lands as belonging to the-entire nation;
but that different bands of Ottawas occupied and had the authority
to dispose of different sections of land, though other bands of
Ottawas may have had some interest therein. in fact, it would seem
from the cessions themselves that the lands conveyed were frequently
jointly owned, not only by different bands of Ottawas, but also by
Chippewas, Pottawatomies, and sometimes by Wyand ttes and other Indian tribes.

The only treaty that seems, from the record, to have been recognized as belonging to one band of Ottawas alone is-the treaty of
August 29, 1821; and that it was recognized as belonging solely to
the Grand River Band of Michigan is indicated by the fact that the
annuity of $1,000 provided therein was thereafter paid to this band
alone, and the payment of said annuity ceased after the release by

this band alone in the treaty of 1855.

In this connection, ‘t is to be noted that the plaintiffs in

Docket No. 133, in their original petition, assert an interest in

the lands ceded by the treaty of August 29, 1821, but thereafter

ff

abandoned such claim of right in said land. Plain iffs in Docket
No. 133 seem to have recognized that they could not consistently
conten that the Grand River Band had no interest in the cessions
of l?93, 1807, 1817, and 1818 because they seemed not to have been

garties to said treaties, and yet that they (tee parties to said
treaties) had a claim in the cession-of 1821 which was made solely
by the Grand River Band of Ottawas-- and that to be consistent in

sh-ir contention that the Grand River Band should be denied the

tion in claims based on the treaties of 1795,

1867, 1817, and 1818, the plaintiffs in Docket X0. 133 should abandon

any contention that they were entitled to be beneficiaries of any

elaims based on the 1821 treaty. However, the fact that the

plaintiffs in Docket No. 133 originally contended that the Ottawa
Tribe (that is, all Ottawa Indians) owned the lands ceded by the

treaty of 1821, is persuasive of the contention of the plaintiffs

in Dockets Nos. 40-B, C, D, E, and F that while the Ottawas consisted

As the plaintiffs in Docket No. 133 are not now asserting

interest in the claims being prosecuted in Dockets Nos. 40-B and
40-F, therefore those claims shall be prosecuted alone by the
plaintiffs in said Dockets numbers.

As the claims asserted in Dockets Nos. 40-C, D, and E are based
on treaties ceding lands which bands other than the Grand River Band
may be able to show an interest in, and the same claims are being
asserted in Docket No. 133, therefore Dockets Nos. 40-C, D, E, and
133 shall be consolidated and the respective rights of the bands
shall be determined after all evidence is adduced upon the consolidated trial of said causes.

As this opinion and the findings of fact upon which t is based
involve the several dockets discussed, it is not thought necessary

to render separate opinions or make separate findings of fact, but

this opinion and said findings of fact are applicable to all said

Dockets numbers.
