Sléx by the provisions of which subsequent treaties the terms of
the original treaty of January lb, 183?, were considerably modified.
all three treaties were proclaimed simultaneously and are, therefore,
to all intents and purposes, one composite agreement.

By act of Congress of January l6, 18th (S Stat. 680), it was
provided that no lands ceded by the treaty of 1837 should be sold

after September l, 18b3, for less than $2.50 per acre.

6. (1) Under the terms of the treaty of January lh, l837, as
modified by the treaties of January 20, l838, and of January 23, l838,
the lands ceded to the Government for sale for the benefit of the Indians
were to be surveyed in the usual manner and offered for sale, as other
public lands, as soon as practicable after ratification of the treaties.
Following ratification of the treaties, the General Land Office, in l838,
ordered these lands surveyed pgglimdnary to their being offered for sale.

(2) Article l of the Treaty of December 20, 1837, (7 Stat.
Sb?) provides:

1 g It is agreed, that the sum.of fifty cents per acre shall
be retained out of every acre of land ceded by said tribe, by
the treaty of the lhth of January l837, as an.indemnification

for the location to be furnished for their future permanent

residence and to constitute a fund for emgrating thereto.

7. Defendant has accounted for the sale of h2,23S.59 acres of
land involved, and for the proceeds thereof in the sum of $ll0,l0h.l?,
ans also for lighthouse site sold for $320.00, making a total of

(1) Article l. The said Chippewas of Saginaw, Swan

i;hfexpenditure by the United States for the benefit of the Indians various

tisums of money for various purposes, and reference is made to the text

l:'0f said.Articles for the details.

ll. Under the terms of the treaties_of l855 and 186k the Saginaw

 ::

;~5:e£Indians received individual allotments and patents to lands aggregating

(2) Assuming that the United States would have continued
to make the discretional appropriations for blacksmith and for education as provided by the above treaties, and that all said annuities
as provided were due to tha:*'Saginaw band, a capitalization of said
annuities and benefits surrendered at the rate of 6%, same would have

had a value of $96,666.66.i

0(3) The treaty of August 5, l826, wasexecuted ‘byh rrany bands

. of Chippewas, the Saginaw Band of Chippewas, plaintiff in the present

suit, not being a party thereto. Although the annual appropriation

for $1,000 for education had been paid for years to the. Saginaw Chippewas,
such payments were discretionary with Congress under the terms of the
treaty and other tribes of the Chippewas might have made claim for all

or part of such appropriations if and when made. If this discretionary
appropriation should have been stopped by Congress or claimed by other

tribes, if made, and it should be eliminated as a basis for the capitalization of the annuities released by the Saginaw Chippewas, the commuted A

value of the remaining ‘annuities and benefits would have been approximately $80, 000 .

(LL) Considering the commuted value of thepannuities and

benefits released at the amount of $96,666.66, the net money

consideration received by the Indians under the terms of the treaty

"a '.

of l85S, over and above the ‘annuities released, was the sum of

for the advancement of .moneys by the defendant in the event proceeds
from the sales of land had not provided funds for the objects set

out in Article 1: of the treaty, and that any such advancement "shall

be refunded to the Treasury by said ‘tribe with interest." This Article,

(2) Article 3 of the treaty of 1837 provides that the net

of.Article h of the treaty of January lb, l837, and reaffirmed by
Article 5 of the treaty of December 20, 1837, and by'Article 8 of

the treaty of January lb, 183?. There is no proof that said payments

were made as bribes.

(h) The items of $113.15 and $386.15 are shown to have been

incurred for medical attention and it seems are authorized by.Article h

of the treaty of January lb, 183?.
lb. (1) There was advanced by the defendant under the treaty
f January lb, 183?, the following items {(a) and (b)) which were not
reimbursed to the Government out of proceeds of land sales, to-wit:

(a) A double credit for the sale

‘of hO acres for lighthouse ‘

(b) Expenses of exploration
(Tr. p. 86) 2,018.25

had been conveyed by said treaty to the plaintiff were sold and the
proceeds of such sales (which were not due to the plaintiff) were
credited to it (Defendant's Exhibit No. 2L) in the amount of $11,136.69;
