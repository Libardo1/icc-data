PER CURIAM. The evidence on the merits of this claim was closed
on March 17, 1952, and thereafter, on April 7, 1952, plaintiff filed its

motion to file an amended petition "to conform to the proof’ and to reinstate an individual, one James Strong, as a party plaintiff. Thereafter,

and before the Commission acted on that motion, plaintiff on May 1, 1952,
filed a "substituted motion" for leave to file an amended petition to
conform to the proof previously offered by the parties and to add the
name of James Strong, an individual member of plaintiff tribe, as a party

plaintiff. The last motion expressly withdrew the first motion mentioned

-2above and had attached thereto the proposed amended petition.

Defendant opposes the making of James Strong a party plaintiff,
suing as a representative of all the members of the plaintiff tribe, of
which he is a member, on the ground that a new cause of action.would be
pleaded after the bar of Section 12 of the Indian Claims Commission Act.
The claim here under consideration was one of twenty-seven (the 18th)

included in a petition filed on October 17, 1947, by the Saginaw Chippewa
Indian Tribe of Michigan, a Federal Corporation, and James Strong, as representative of all members of the Chippewa Tribe of Indians of which he

is a member. (Docket No. 13). On July 13, 1949, the Commission ordered

a separation of the causes of action set forth in the original petition,
and plaintiffs herein, accordingly, filed the petition here under consideration but inadvertently omitted James Strong as a party plaintiff. Under

the circumstances we believe he should be reinstated as a party plaintiff

in the petition herein.

Defendant opposes the proposed amended petition on the further ground
thah the plaintiff has stated three new and different causes of action
which, under the limitation of said Section 12 of the Indian Claims Commission Act, cannot now be asserted. As we read the proposed amended
petition we believe it is merely an attempt to elaborate somewhat on the
former allegations of the petition, and fairly construed cannot be said
to change the causes of action alleged in the petition. The difference
‘between the two, as claimed by defendant, is too elusive for practical

application in the determination of these claims. However, since we are

-3of the opinion that no new or different claims are attempted to be set

up in the proposed amended petition, we see no need for the amendments
proposed. The three claims now relied upon (First, Second and Fourth

of the petition - the Third, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh having been
expressly withdrewn by the motion of May 1, 1952) are sufficiently

pleaded in the original petition to permit an adjudication thereof, in
fact, we believe the original petition is in some respects superior to

the proposed amended pleading, so there seems to be no reason for encumbering the record with an unnecessary amendment. This is not a situation, it
may be pointed out, that comes within Sec. l3(b) of our Rules.

The motion will therefore be overruled by appropriate order.
