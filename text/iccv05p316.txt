FIEDINGS OF FACT

The Commission makes the following findings of fact:
These findings apply to each of Dockets Do. ll-A and No. 138.

1. In Docket KO. 138 the petitioner, Omaha Tribe of Nebraska,

is entitled.to maintain this action.on Eehalf of the “Omabo Tribe

5 317

are entitled to bring this action on behalf f the "Iowa Tribe or Nation";
and the petitioners Sac and Fox Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma, Sac and Fox
Tribe oi‘ Missouri, and Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa, also
known as Sac and Fox Nation, and (sometimes referred to as United Tribes
o Sac and Fox) are entitled to maintain this action.

In Docket No. ll-A the petitioner is the Otoe and Missouria Tribe of
Indians, which is entitled to maintain the action asserted.

Each of the said Tribes of Indians, namely, the "Omaha Tribe," the
“Iowa Tribe," and the “Sac and Fox Tribe“ is also represented in this
proceeding by certain individuals who are respectively members of % said

2. The land involved in this case is located east of he Missouri
River in what is now western Io'.~;a and northwestern Missouri. It is part
of the area (km.-n as Royce Cessioin 151) described in Article 1. of the
Treaty of July 15, l830. The pat of Cession lS'l in which recofrery is

sought in this case is that part south of the line described in Article 2

of the 'h"eat}* of August l9, 1825' (herein sometiszes called the "Article 2
line,“ and sornetimes the “S-c and Fox-Sioux line” and sometimes the
“Yancton line“), and based on the planir.eter method of calculation,
contains. appro::ir.atel'j ten million acres.

types of game, including beaver, otter, muskrat, prairie fowl, deer and
some buffalo, and was used by the tribes for hunting purposes. As time
pmogressed.to the treaty period of 1825 and 1830, the area.was of value
to the tribes as hunting grounds and for trapping of beaver and other fur
bearing animals. The subsistence and economy of the tribes depended in
significant part upon the product of the hunt and the barter of furs with
traders. I

.1“,

Otoe, Missouria and Iowa, hunting in and otherwise using in Indian fashion

Early writings report various tribes, including the Sioux , Omaha,

various parts of the Cession 151 area at different times in the 18th Century.
In the first two decades of the l9th Century, the tribes, among others, reported as hunting in or using the area were the Yankton Sioux, Omaha, Otoe,
Iowa, and Sac and Fox. I

5. As noted, the area of Cession l5l was used by the tribes essentially
for hunting purposes. Except for a village established by the Iowa tribe
near the present Council Bluffs on the Missouri River, in the first half
of the 18th Century, and which it abandoned in approximately 1765, there
is no evidence that any Indian Tribe had an agricultural or so-called
"summer" village in the Cession 151 area for approximately l0O years preceding the l82S Treaty. However, it appears that prior to 1730, the Iowa,
Otoe and Omaha had summer villages in the Cession 151 area. In l827, the.
Iowa established a village near the Little Platte River in the southernmost
portion of the Cession 151 area. At approximately the same time, the aboveu

mentioned small band of "Sac and Fox of Missouri," which in 1813 had been

detached from the main.body of the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi,

and had gone to live tith the-Iowa Tribe, established a village in the
Cession 191 area, a few miles to the north of said Iowa village. Thus,
at the time of the 1830 treaty‘ the only Indians having summer villages
within the Cession lSl area were'the Iowa Tribe and the Sec and Fox of
Hissouri. H waver, fighting between the Sec and Fox andrthe Oméhacand
Otoe in this area.reported as occurring between l82O and l830. The
Omahas and the Otoes probably crossed the Missouri river from permae
nent villages west of the river.

6. A though the'Iankton.Sioux were associated.primarily with the
area now southwestern Minnesota, and northwestern Iowa from the head
of the upoer Des Eoines to the Big Sioux, above the Article 2 line,
it “ppears that.at times in the 18th Century, the Yankton Sioux made
claims to and ranged over territory south of the Article 2 line. There
is one letter ¥LiCh reports the Iankton as occasionally hunting, sometime
during the period.from 1813 to 1830, in the territory between the Boyer
uiver and the mouth of the Big Sioux, in conjunction with'the Omaha and
_3?Parently with the permission of the Omaha. By the 1825 treaty the

United St*tes recognized the Article 2 line as the southern.boundary'of

CO

ioux territoryu Ehrther, hy the l82S treaty, the Sioux (except the

'Yankton) agreed.that the said.Article 2 line constituted the southern.

ratified said lie .
7. As to th area of Cession lSl south of the “rticle 2 line, it

used by said tribes in said area as delineated by John Dougherty,

for the tribes of the Upper tissouri, in his letter dated July 59 1830 to

‘J.

ailliam Clark, Su,arintendent of Indian b rs for the area, were that the
territory south of the line described in Article 2 down to the Boyer River
was used for hunting by the Cmaha; that the territory from the Boyer River
down to the Nodavay River was used as hunting ground by the Ctoe; and that
the remaining portion of the Cession I51 area south of the Nodaway was used

by the Iowa, and that in the early part of the 19th century the Sac and Fox

entered the area.

8. As to Omaha;. Ethnological accounts of the primitive Omaha after

 

they reached the region of the Missouri River between the Platte and the

O

entrance of ig Sioux in the 18th Century show that hunting was vital to

the tribe’s existence, ana that while the hunting of the'bison took place

\

in Nebraska, west of the Kissouri hirer, where the tribe had its agriculO %

tural villages, the huntlng zor the beaver, otter, muskrat and deer took

place on both sides of the Xissouri River. The early writings of travelers,
Indian agents, and others commencing in the latter part of the 18th Century
down to the time of the 1830 Treaty, confirm that the Cmaha hunted east of

the Hissouri River in the area of Cession 151, north of the Boyer R"ver and

.10

across from the v llage sites of th Cxaha on the west side of the Eissouri.

ever since nv residence in their country. I understand their different languages and have heard them converse repeatedly on the subject
of their se ins, and altho some of them may at this

moment, seeing the overnne.t wishes to purchase, differ with me I
have no hesitation in believing that the following statement of their
claims is as correct a one as you will be able to procure from the
Indians themselves or any one else, viz.: * * :_The Cmahaws claim from
the entrance of the Bangeau.[i.e., Boyer river] to that of Big Sioux
or Calumet liver opposite their old Black Bird village on the Missouri
and back following the Bangeau.[§oyer7'& Big Sioux river to their
sources. It may not here be improper to mention that the lankton
Sioux known by the name of the Li tle Dishes band were driven by the
Sackes & Foxes in l€l3 from the Demoines river and took refuge and
have occasionally hunted in ccnjuncti 3 with the Cmahaws on the lands
last named but to which they have no claim. Their lands together
‘with the upoer Yanktons is situated above the Big Sioux river where
Capt. Lewis and yourself found them in l805 while on your way to

the Pacific, and extend up the Ho. to the Teton Sioux country; * * *.

 

      

l0. As to Ctoe: at least after the early part of the 18th Century,

and south of the Platte Rivers, "nd they hunted in Nebraska west of the
hissouri and south of the .latte. however, by the same token, early
writings of explorers, Indian agents, and others, down to the date of the
lS3O treaty, report the Ctoe as also hunting east of the Missouri River

in th area of Cession l5l sout. of the lover River and down to the Eodaway'
River, directly across from the sites of the Ctoe villages on the west

bank of the hissouri River. Thus, Eiro in 1785, Long in 1819-1820,

Dougherty in 1828 aid l829, Stuart and Dougherty in lE30, all report the

{J

toe as hunting in the id area of Cession l5l. The aforesaid letter of

l3. During the latter part of the 18th Century the Sac and Fox
Nation and the Iowa Nation began to penetrate tho eastern portion of
Cession lSl from the Nodaway watershed south and contested the use of
this area with the Kansas, Osage and other Indian tribes. The Sac and
Fox were at war from much of the period l808 to 1830 with the Iowas,
the Sioux, the Ctoe, the Omahas, and the Kansas and other tribes. It
was not convincingly established that any Sac and Fox had penetrated
south and west of the Kodaway River prior to l827.

EVESTS LEaDI§G UP TO TREATY CF AUGUST l9, l825.

lb. War parties of the Sac of the hississikpi were reported on
the Yissouri River in the spring of 1820, and in May l82O there was
reported an attack by the Sac and the Iowa against the Omaha and Otoe,
during which one Ctoe and two Omaha Indians were killed.. There were
also reports of hostilities against the whites and thefts of horses and
mules by Sac Indians in the Cession l5l area.

15. Following these incidents, Benjamin O‘Fallon (then Indian

4'70

Agent for the tribes of the Upper Missouri) as well as william Clark,

reported their views that the intent of the Sec and Fox Tribe was to make

a conquest of the Omaha, toe and other tribes of the Hissouri River for

O

purpose of seizing possession of the country they used; and William.Clark

further expressed the opinion that the Sac and Fox would accomplish this

ncident taking olace in the winter of l820, and the
second in early l822, the Sac and Fox, joined by the Iowa, in June l822,
sent a war party out against the Yankton Sioux for the asserted purpose

of retaliating. After June l822 and continuing down to the time of the

 

1825 treaty, there are reports of recurring hostilities and bloody warfare between the Sec and Fox and the Yankton Sioux.

l7. During these years preceding the l825 treaty when the Sac ans
Fox of the Mississippi were engaged in conflict wit the Yankton Sioux,
warfare was also being waged or difficulties existedg between other tribes
in the region of the present States of Minnesota, Eichigan, and Illinois.
Also there was report of threatening hostilities between the Sec and Fox

Your Great father the president of the United States

. . . intends to he always upon the different 'ln€S which
separate your different countries to prevent any bad people ‘

from crossing over to do mischief.
22. -The provisions of said Treaty of 1825 are hereby:made a finding

of fact by reference as if copied herein in haeo verba.

   

23. The Sac and Fox and Iowa Indians considered the l825 treaty
as acknow_edgment of Indian title in the Sac and Fox and Iowa, together, to the area running from the Hississippi to the Missouri, south

$.1of the Sac and Fox-Sioux line and betaeen it and the nisscuri State line-subject to the rights of the Ctoes and Kissourias; which included not
only the lands involved herein but also lands to the east and between
the east line of Session l5l and the Kississiooi River.

The provisions of érticl ll of the Treaty for the holding ol

tl)

councils in 1826 with the Yancton-Sioux and with the Ctoes were not carried out, the reason given being lack of appropriations therefor. By
contrast, however, Lewis Cass, Governor of Michigan Territory; obtained
funds which enabled him to hold council with tribes under his jurisdiction for to- final settlement of the boundaries left open in the l825
treaty (see Treaty with Chippewas 7 $tat.290; and 7 Stat. 303).

The absence of the Chahas and Ctoe and Kissouria at the council
resulting in the Treaty of i825 nay have been due to the fact that it
appears that at the same tine, Gen. Atkinson and Agent C‘Fallcn were
co;nissioned to hold treaties with the Chahas, toe and Kissonrias and

others.

For the purpose of completing the work left u.’inished by

the Treaty, article ll thereof provides that ”xhenever the President

may think it necessary and proper, to convene such of the tribes, either
separately or together, as are interested in the lines left unsettled
herein, and recommend to them.an amicable and final adjustment of their

In the Fall of 1829, General Clark in a letter to the Commissioner
of Indian affairs discussing the Indian situation in this section advised
that sane might be ascribed "to a great meas're by the failure on the part
of the Government in establishing the'houndaries between those tribes as
provided for by the llth article of th Treaty of august l9, l825."

23. at the request of Secretary or Ear eaton, Robert Stuart, an

"agent for the imerican Fur Company, reported, by letter dated ;ebruary 9,

1330, to Secretany Eaton concerning the Mississippi and Missouri Indians.
Stuart advised of news that the Sioux of the Kississippi and Missouri,

in concert with the henominee and Winnebago, were planning a war of
extermination against the Sac and Fox, commencing on the opening of
spring. Like other informants, Stuart attributed the cause of this
threatening outbreak “in no small degree" to the failure of the United
States to fulfill the commitment made in the Treaty of august l9, l825,
to define the boundary lines between_the Sac and Fox and the "hissouri
Indians.“ Stuart reported that the Sac and Fox were "being constantly

pressed u_on by'the whites; and the game having nearly disappeared,in

their own indisouted ccuntrv they had become restless and reckless

0

of consequences." F “ther, in reoortin

.9 5-3

on the difficulty in the area of

_Cession l5l and his information as to the tribes who had been using said

area for hunting pur oses, he stated that the Sac and Fox were claim_ng

In

"which have alxays been considered to belong to the Missouri Indians,"
when he designated as the Sioux, the Cmaha, the Ctoe and the Iowa. also
he r marxeo tnct said hunting grounds were the best in that region.

ground for them all.“ Thus Agent Dougherty‘s
said letter reader

Since my arrival at this place I understand the difficulties
relative to hunting grounds still exists even to a greater degree
than ever between the Sioux, Omahaws, Ctoes and other tribes of
Indians on the Eissouri, and the Sacks & Fox Tribes on the Mississippi.
The soil in question is good, well watered, and a considerable portion
of it well timbered and it is the only hunting ground left for the
Yanktons, Cnahaws, Ctoes & Icways. These tribes complain that the
Sacks and Foxes have sold their hunting grounds to the United States
for which they receive an annuity that enables them.to carry on a successful war and keep possession of lands to which, they of right have
no claim. I believe it to be the wish of the above named tribes on
Missouri, that a treaty be held for the purpose of making peace between them and the Sacks & Foxes. and that the government purchase
the country in dispute & make it'a common hunting ground for them all.
"As I knon'of no better mode of adjusting the existing difficulties I
beg leave to suggest the propriety of complying with their wiehne..

5

‘which could now be done with ease and at a small expense to the U. .
tates. The tract of country so acquired.uill form a fine territory.for such tribes if the government might choose to locate there.

30. Both Thomas L. Mcienney, then in charge of the Office of Indian

Affairs, and William Clark approved Agent Dougherty's above-mentioned proposal to purchase the Cession I51 area from.th Missouri tribes for purpose

of a common hunting ground, as hereinafter shown, and Thomas L. hohenney,

on behalf of the Secretary of war and by direction of the President, advised
General Clark, in £pri_ I 30, that he was authorized, in collaboration with
the Commanding Cffioer at Prairie du Shien, to carry the proposal into effect.

For purpose of arresting this impending war, the Secretary accordingly
directed t at the Commanding Officer, in cooperation with William.Clark,
assemble the tribes (inclu‘ing all potitioners and the Otoe) at Prairie

33. By letter dated April 27, 1830, General Clark acknowledged
receipt of the letter of Thomas In Mchenney dated April 5, 1830 and
stated his intentions, pursuant to the authority granted in.said letter,
to attempt to accomplish at one and the same council to be held about
July h, 1830, the proposed pacification of the tribes, and.the purchase
of lands "for purpose of a common.hunting ground.”

3Q- General Clark took special precautions to see that the Sac
and Fox and each of the tribes eho.were known to have hunted in the
Cession 151 area, namely, the Omaha, Ctoe, Iowa and Yankton Sioux,
were represented at the proposed treaty council. he dispatched instructions to the Indian agents for the tribes as to the purposes of the
council, and directed them to seek out the tribes in their respective
villages and personally to accompany delegations of the tribes to the
place of the treaty council.

35. General Clark assigned to agent Dougherty t.e task of
arranging for the attendance of deputations from the Omaha, Otoe and
Yankton and Santie Bands of Siou‘. iFurther, General Clark sent a
special emissary, Agent Bean, to assist Agent Dougherty in thi task.

General Clark presented to agent Bean copies of a written.mesaage which

'7

was delivered to the Omaha, Otoe and ianktcn Si ux, in which Gen ral Clark

alladvised of his anxiety to see the said tribes at peace and that the

Purpose of the proposed treaty council was “to fix your limits and arrange

it;
:1
‘C

all business between you and the _ssissippi tribes." General Clark‘s

I send you words to be delivered to you by your agent — I
hope you wi‘l do as he advises you. I also send one of my sons
and his friend Er. Pope to see you, and go with you to Prairie
du Chien, that you may hear the words of your Great Father the
President of the United States, to be delivered by his Com:andi.g

fficer at that place, to his red children who have been at war
with each other.

 

3'."* * * Rs I an anxious to see you at peace, and in the enjoyment of happiness, I will go myself to Prairie du Chien and meet
you there sixty five days after this day (or, in two moons) and talk
with you and my other red children, and will endeavor to fix your
limits and arrange all business between you and the Mississippi
tribes.

Hy son who will accompany you, will afford an assurance that no
injury wil‘ be done to you by your enemies whilst with hi.

36. In his letter of instructions, dated april 25, l830, to John
Dougherty, General Clark advised that the purpose of assembling the tribes
at Pr-irie du Chien was to arrange for a general pacification and that he
contemp_ated also the purchase of some land from the tribes for a common
hunting ground. General Clark further emphasized the importance of having
deputations from the Omaha, Ctoe and Iankton and Santil Bands of Sioux
because the presence of those tribes was necessary not only to establish
the line between then and the Sac and Fox, but also because those
tribes were claimants to pcrt of the country which he proposed to purchase for a common hunting ground. Thus, after advising that the

principal object in view at the proposed treaty council was a "general

wabasha, a chief of the Sioux of the Hississiooi (Hedawakanton Band) asked

 

‘Q0

for an increase of the annuity offered to the Sioux of th mississippi from

$2000 to $3000 per annum. He also asked for an additional sum of $3000

to pay debts owning to traders. aabashaw said, in part:

Now, my fathers, we agree to let you have the slip of land
you ask for, with the privilege to us of hunting on it; for we
depend on our t-aders and must hunt - and also for the purpose of
heeging other Indians off our lcnds. as to the land, we are all
agreed: but we must have $3000 a year for ten years. ‘

General Clark had offered on annuity of $2500 to the Iowa, whereas to the Sac
he offered $3,000 and to the Fox,

$3,000. Pei-ton—sou, speaking on behalf

expressed the View that the Iowa should receive a little more than

 

because th Sac and Fox, having hunted their land until
nothing was left, had entered into the Iowa land as well as the Omaha and Ctoe
lands, for purpose of hunting.

north of the Yancton line (which is not, however, involved herein) as well as

I

that south of said line, subject to the following proviso:

But is understood that the lands ceded and relinquished by this
Treaty, are to be assigned and allotted under the direction of
the President of the United States, to the Tribes now living
thereon, or to such other Tribes as the President nay locate
thereon for hunting, and other purposes. T

In view of statements made by Commissioners in communications prior to
the convening of the Indians in July 1830 and statements made during the
negotiation resulting in the treatv to the effect that the said londs were

\.)

There are indications that the Indians considered the cession as providing for the use of the tribes participating therein and no others.

Keokuck, the leading Sac and Fox chief said "as respects the land you spoke

F-I

say, that as it is only for those other tribes to hunt on, in
common with ourselves, we agree to it."

There is no evidence in the record that prior to the treaty council any
intimation in any way was made to any of the tribes that it would.be prooosed to them at the council that other tribes not then hunting in the area
and not them asserting rights therein would be made to share in the use of
the area involved; on the contrary, it was considered that the purpose of
convening the council was to fix the limits of the respective tribes, then
claiming interest in the area, that is to adjusting their respectiue boundaries. agent Bougherty, who probably knew more about what was said to the
Indians and how understood by them than any other white person because of
his long life with the understanding of them, and because he acted as inter»
preter for the Omaha and Gtoe Tribe at the time, states in a letter of

roe-I-‘v

cucrnber 6, 183? (Omaha Ex. 7) that it was explained to them that other

_“-ian Tribes were_to be given rights jointly with the Indians participating

in the treaty "it was well understood by the Commissioners and Indian that

they (the ceding Indians) were to retain in perpetuity in common with other
In ians. the hunting privilege; and was never intimated to them, that at a
suoseeuent period they would be compelled to abandon this rig t, to make
room for other tribes."

(2) Despite the fact that the orovisions for allotment cu ted does

particioating for their use in common, statements made by the Indians during
the cession and statements made in conmunications between Governmental officials, prior to the cession, were that the plan was that the territory involved
was to be acquired for subsequent use by the tribes participating in the treaty
as a common hunting ground. agent Dougherty in a letter to General Clark,
dated Zpril 2, 1830 (Iowa Ex. 109) stated that he believed such a plan to be

in accordance with the wishes of the Indians, and Col. HcKinney in a letter of
April 5, 1830 to General Clark expressed approval of such a plan and authorized
General Clark to carry out such plans in negotiating a treaty. In arranging
for the treaty council, Gen. Clark reiterated a number of times his purpose

to allot the area as a common hunting ground and in his speech to the tribes

at the treaty council as to the purpose of the treaty being negotiated
General Clark stated that the land sought to be ceded to the Governmert was

to be allotted as a common hunting ground. This statement is fully quoted

in this respect in Finding No. 3?.

The subsequent actions of th defendant Government show that it considered
the petioners in Dockets No. l38 and No. ll-A to have been the sole owners of

the lands involved herein.

In the aforesaid letter of Agent Daugherty dated December 6, 1837,

speaking more particularlv as to the claims of the Omaha and Otoe, but which
lan~uage is really applicable to all ceding tribes said, in part:

fact that the desire for the treatv and the purpose of its execution was

primarily to prevent further warfare between the tribes, further hazarding
of the lives of the citizens of the United States in the Indian country, and
for the purpose of carrying out the commitments as to fixing boundaries made in

the 1825 treaty: and it seems evident that the United States by offering the

tribes involved the plan whereby the United States would take title to the

area and then set aside for the common use of all the tribes, was submitting

said plcn in lieu of, or in substitution for the commitments made by Articles

3 and 11 of the Treaty of august 19, 1825 that the United States would adjust
boundaries of the respective tribes. This is definitely the

effect of the statement of General Clark to the council as quoted in Finding 39.

The speeches of tribal chiefs at the treaty council in accepting said proposal indicated that this was their under tending.

No assignments or allotments of lands in the Cession 151 area

were made to any of the tribes which were parties to the 1830 treaty. Bowever their continuing interest in the area, as to the sole owners, was recognized by treaties made thereafter with them and no others to extinguish such

interest.

The United States never obtained the consent of any of the tribes

who were parties to the Treaty of July 15, 1830 to the grant of said five million acre tract in Cession 151 to the Pottcvatoni; but obtained cessions from
them thereafter.

The Potawatomi lived on the five million acre tract in Cession

151 from 1837 until 1846, when by treaty of June 5 and June 17, 1846 they
ceded the tract to the United States. Thereafter the Cession 151 area was
opened to public settlement and disposed of pursuant to the Statutes of the

The recited condideration zor sa d cession was o){7,uo3 in investments tor the tribe, payment of debts, orovisions and services.

(3) (a) Under date of April 22, 1828, a treaty was executed with

the Omaha and with the Otoe and Kissouria for relinouishment of their respective
rights and interests in the area of Cession 151. The recited consideration

to the Otoe and Eissouria was $25,000, and the recited consideration to the
Omaha was $37,500. However, the treaty was never ratified.

(b) On March 15, 1854 (10 Stat. 1038) a treaty was concluded

with the Otoe and Missouria, by which they ceded interest in area of Cession
151. Consideration therefor not definitely determinable by treaty provisions.

(c) On March 16, 185k (10 Stat. lC&3) the United States concluded a treaty with the Omaha whereby the Omaha relinquished its i,terest
in the area of Cessicn 151. Consideration therefor not definitely determinable by treaty provisions.

(b) ‘we conclude and find therefore, that the territorial rights or
interests of the respective tribes in the lands of th 1830 cession (Tract

151), passed to the United States in the manner and on the dates as follows:

(a) "hat part of tne cessicn situate in northwes Hissouri,

5&3) and the Sac and Fox rights therein passed to defendant on February 16,
1838, the date said treaties were ratified;

(d) The interest of the Otoe-Missouria Tribe in that part of
the cession lying westerly and northerly of the watershed mentioned above
was ceded by said tribe to defendant by said treaty of March 15, 1854,
and such rights passed to defendant on April 17, 1854, the date said
treaty was ratified;

(e) The interest of the Omaha Trike in that part of the cession

by said tr ,

The exterior boundary of the lands involved in these cases
Session 151) was defined by Article 1 of the Tree y of July 15, 1830,

7 Stat. 328. although said Article 1 reduired that the lands in the
cession be "assigned and allotted“ to the tribes who executed the treaty
and who were then living thereon, no such allotments were made. Eowever,

the evidence shows that the signatory tribes, and none other, were in

occnoation of the lands of the cession at the time of the treatv and

(a)

The Iowa Tribe or Nation, all lands of the lE3O cessicn lying

easterly and southerlv of the katershed.which separates the Nodewa (hodoway

II

and Nishnahotony rivers in said cession and extends from the Missouri river
to the easterly line of the cession ahout midway between the sources of the
Nodewa and Hishnahotony rivers;

(b)

as to the lands of the cession l -ng westerly and northerly
of the Nodewa-Nishnabotony watershed, the evidence is not sufficient to
make a division between the areas used by the Otoe-Missouria, Omaha and

the Sac and Fox tribes. It shows that this part of the cession was used

by the three tribes for hunting in such parts as gene was encountered.

We find, therefore, hat the area was used in co.mcn by the three tribes

\

and that each used and was entitled to an undivided one-third interest
thereof.
51. Since the several cessions of the lands of the l83O cession

(Tract 151), set forth in Finding h9 include lands outside of the tract

without any separation of the considerations paid for the lands within

the l830 cession, t is impossible to determine from the record in these

here
for the landsjinvolved.

must postpone such determinations until oroof is submitted.
