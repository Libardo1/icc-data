OPINION 93  ccsazlsszom

   

Ofnarr, Associate Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the

Commission.

The claim here asserted.is for the recovery of the value of an
area of land located in northeast Idaho and northwest Montana extending
south of the Canadian border. It is described in Finding 8 and comprises lands ahoriginally possessed by the petitioner tribe.

The claim is predicated upon a treaty concluded between the

oezenoant and the Confederated tribes of the Flathead, "ootenay and

A word about the present status of the petitioners. The oriainal
petition was filed July 23, l9Sl, and was consolidated for trial with
another Kootenai case, Docket No. 61, and evidence was submitted in the
consolidated hearings by which it was shown that the petitioners here
were a group of Kootenai entirely separate from the Kootenai in Docket

No. 61 and at he time of the l85S cession.held‘their lands independently

petitioners had a joint interest in the lands ceded by the l8§S treaty

with the confederated tribes which executed it. .A cursory reading of
it would lead to the opinion that the alleged claim is for a share of
the consideration paid or to be paid, apportioned in accordance with
the petitioners‘ ri hts as joint owner of‘the ceded lands.

It is apparent th-t the original petition was prepared without a
clear knowledge of the facts upon.which the claim.was based. However
that may be, there are allegations of fact contained in the original
Detition that justitr end.prc?idc the bases for the amended pleading;

Ii

('2
In!

It is quite plain from the original petition thet the petitioner
are suing for the loss of whatever lands they had in the area ceded by
the Confederated Tribes in 1355. _To be sure it is alleged (Par. 5) that
the petitioners were "a joint O§E£r of the lands which were ceded to the
United States“ by the 1855 treaty}'but it should be patent to any one,
especially the Goverrment, acquainted.with Indian land use that joint
nae. of Indian lands is uncommon and the Indians generally occupy and
jealously defendr their aboriginal lands. This habit is particularly
true of sedentary Indians, as was the petitioner group. So to prove

the claim.as pleaded in the original petition it was necessary to show

occupation of lands by the petitioner group in the area ceded. The fee

a technical eeparoarand should not reouire a dismissal of the claim. Pleadings must be

lioerally construed in order to give the Indians their day in court,

and where the defendant has not been prejudiced by the amended petition
and was given full opoortunitv to meet the proof offered by petitioners.
we believe it woul"work an.injustice on petitioners to dismiss their

petition since we believe the original petition was broad enough to

permit a recovery for lands acquired by defendant which were exclusively

aboriginally nossessed by petitioners.
The petitioners in this case are actually the Bonners Ferry Band

\

of Kootenai Indians. Petitioners claim that they have from time imznenorial used. and occupied in Indian fashion certain described.lands
in northern Idaho andihontana. These lands are described it Finding 8.

The so-called.Koctenai Tribe never existed within the memory of
man.as an ent'tyt The Kootenai Indians are divided by the authorities
into two cultural groups -- the_Upper Kootenai who were composed.of the
eastern bands which were more under the influence of the plains traits,
and the Lower Kootenai bands who were more sedentary, canoe people, and
located farther to the north and'west and thus less in contact with plains
traits. (Fdg. 2).

These two cultural groups were separate and distinct bands, politically autonomous and independent of each other and held their lands

to the exclusion of each other. (Fdg. 2). The Lower Koctenai consisted

Since the first white contact by the for traders such as Thompson,
Alexander Henry (the younger), and'Work, Kootenai Indians have been
living in the vicinity of Bonners Ferry and even today there are still
some families of Eonners Ferry Indians living there on lands allotted

(Fdg. S). Ethnological studies such as made

to them by the Government.
by'Turney-High and Schaeffer place the Bonners Ferry Kootenai within the
lands clained by petitioners during historical times.

The Bonners Ferry Kootenai being culturally part of the Lower Kootenai were, ethnologically speaking, a sedentary people. They seldom

source or food was fish but this diet had to be sapplemented~with berries,

Q

roots, meat and other foods and to obtain these the oand had to scour
their territory in season, either individually, in family groups or in
communal efforts depending on the activity'engaged in at the time.
(Fdg. 6) .

.A unique feature of the Lower Kootenai was the concept of property"
ownership by extended.fanily groups and.each reportedly could point to a

O

certain section of their country as their own. This was first pointed
out in the writings of Baille-Grohman.(?et. Ex. 66), and Schaeffer reports
that he was able to confirm the same type of land holding by families in

the Bonners Ferry Band itself. Pet. Ex. 62~a). Besides these individual

I I C

holdings, Schaeffer testified that there were also tribal lands on which

all of the band could hunt.

petitioners herein, were a separate a
groups and an autonomous political unit at the time of the owning of the
whites and have remained such till the present tnne. It was her opinion
that the Bonners Fer-r'"ootenai exclusively occupied the area delineated
in red on.petitioners‘ Exhibit 7 south of the international boundary line
until the whites entered the area and disrupted the possession of the
tribe subsequent to the treaty of l8SS (T. 535-538).

On cross~examination, Dr. Lurie testilied that it was her opinion,
based upon a study of the material she had perused, that there was but
"ore definitely established band of Lower Kootenai, as such, enjoying
its Own political autonomy," with Bonners Ferry as their'tain camp.

(T. 555-559). Defendant‘s counsel had urged that petitioners‘ exhibits
of studies made by Turney-E; h and Schaeffer indicated there were several
independent bands of Lower Kootenai, i.e., the Bonners Ferry, the Creston
and the Nelson bands.

The deposition of Dr. laude E. Schaeffer was taken by petitioners
and appears as petitioners’ Exhibit 62-A3 and extracts of his field notes
on the Kootenai are to be found in petitioners‘ Enhibit 3h ind defendant‘s
Exhibits 3?-hi, inclusive. Dry Schaeffer did field work with the fpper
Kootenai in the l93h-36 period, and in 1937 did field work with the

In support of its position defendant called Richard G. Forbis,

Defendant contends that this area shows the:maximum amount of land really

used and occupied by petitioners. (T. 633). Forbis,testified that he

found that a majority of their subsistence was obtained in areas under

hOOO feet (T. 6l9) and, on cross exanination, he stated that he did not

mean that the Bonners Ferry did not go above the EOOO-foot contour at

times. (T. 670). The witness further testified that the E000-foot line

Date Indi*n Title Passed

 

Counsel for the parties are in complete disagreement as to the date

upon which the lands in controversy passed to defendant free of Indian

CO

title, the latter insisting that the In.ian'title passed on M-rch R; 185?,

when.the Senate ratified the treaty of July l6, 1855,-l2 Stat. 975,

while petitioners contend th title of the Indians passed only when there
:as actual disposition of the lands by defendant under the public land

laws of the United States or the conversion of the lands to the use of

the Government. The date of the extinguishnent of Indian title is important

because of the necessity of detennining the value of the land .

The 1855 treaty was concluded nit ;e'.lathead;'Eooten y'an (Upper

cannot be denied. Lone Eolf V. Litchcock, 157 U.S. 553, 55
Tribe v. United States, l36 C. Cls. {Appeal No. --55, decided November'7,
1956). Nor is the manner of taking important, given a purpose or intent
to acquire Indian lands. Such lands may be taken through mistake in

1

surveys, as in the Creek Case, 302 U.S. 620; or by placing In ians of
one tribe on the lands of another without the latter‘s consent, as was
done in the Uintah case, 5 Ind. Cl. Com. D7, or by treaty which ceded
lands of tribes not parties to the treaty, as was done in the Nooksack
case, 3 Ind. Cl. Com. H79, and.tne Euckleshoot case, 3 Ind. Cl. Com. 669.

The intention of defendant to extinguish the Kootenai title by the
1855 treaty is evidenced by the fact that their lands were included in
the area ceded.::Thc trea'y also provided and required the Zndians in
the territory ceded to move to the reservation set aside for th m and.
as to the ancestors of members of the petitioner tribe, negotiations
extended over several years for giving them allo nents in the area they
now and did then claim as their ancestral home, under section h of the
allotment act of February 8, 1887, 2h Stat. 388. Abparently such allotments were made. Section h of said act provided for allotments on lands
to which Indian title had been ea-:tirlgrished and is therefore evidence of
the Government‘s vi n that the lands on which the allotments‘were2nade had
been ceded by the l855 treaty.

In tnese circumstances, we must consider the date, Harch 8, 1359, on

which the Jul" 16, l85§; treaty was ratified as the time the defendant

acquired the Indians’ aboriginal rights to the lands involved hereo

the lands from the possessory rights of the petitioners. Cf. Nooksack
and.huckleshoot cases, supra.

Counsel for petitioners base their position that the dates of the
actual disposals of the Indian lands should fix the time that the Indian
title passed on the Uintah case (Doc. bk, decided February 21, 1957),

S Ind. Cl. Com. 1, in which we held that the Ute Indians were deprived of
their lands as and when disposed of or converted by the Government. In
that case, however, there had been no treaty which even purported to
extinguish Indian tit e to Ute lands (a treaty knosn.as the Spanish Fork
treaty had been negotiated in l86S, out was rejected by the Senate).
Hence the Utes were not deprived of their lands except as the Government
disposed of then or used them for governmental purposes. In that situe
ation there seemed no alternative but to take the'tnnes of actual
disposals of the Ute lands as the dates of taking.

The Creek Nation case, 302 U.S. 620, also relied on by petitioners,
presented a shnilar problem in that the Government disposed of in parcels
to settlers certain lands of the Greeks. It had no right to make the
oisposa_s and nothing had been done prior to the disposals which could be
considered as fixing a date on which the entire area in which the disposals

were made, was taken. Under those conditions the Suprene Court held tle
taking took place as and when the several parcels were patented to entry5181"}.
