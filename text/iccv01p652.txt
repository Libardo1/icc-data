O‘Marr, Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission:

OFFSETS
 interlocutory order of the Gormnission made on the lltth day of
March, 1951, the plaintiffs were found entitled to an award in the sum
of $987,092.00, subject to deductions for offsets to which the defendant may be entitled under the provisions of section 2 of the act

1 Ind.” C"1."h Comm. 644 653

creating; the Indian Claims Commission (25 U.S.C.A. TO; 60 Stat. 1019).
The defendant's offsets are now to be considered by the Commission.
These offsets are set forth in defendant's Amended "Amended Answer,"

which will hereafter ‘be referred to as the Amended Answer.

IAND CEDED QU.£‘.L=A.I:I - TREATY OF 1833
After the Quapaw moved to the Caddo country on the Red river,

pursuant to the treaty of November 15, 1821!-, 7 Stat. 232, and found

the conditions there detrimental to health, destruction of crops , and

the Caddo antagonistic, they requested the defendant to restore at

least a part of their lands ceded in 1821:. arms, the defendant would

not do (see Pltfs‘ Ex. 63, 13.8139), but finally agreed to convey 150
sections of land to be "selected and assigned by the Commissioners of
Indian Affairs, west." Article II of treaty of May 1. , 1833, '{ Stat.
N21}. The treaty provision was carried out ‘by selecting 82,808.23

acres of land in northeast Oi-rlahoma and southeast Kansas , and paying

the Qiafaw $39,}-3:23 .03, to compensate them for the difference between

the 150 sections (96,000 acres) the defendant agreed to convey and the
82,808.23 acres it did convey, such deficiency in acreage "c-e5.cg 13,191.77.
Act of March 3, 1891 (25 Stat. 989, 998). e is for the value of the
land actdally conveyed plus the araotmt paid for the deficiency that the
defendant claims as an offset and which the plaintiffs strenuously oppose.
The $39,323 .03 was accepted in lieu of that part of the 150 sections
(95,000 acres) not conveyed so mnst be considered as thougjn the 13,191.77
acres had actually been conveyed.

to Article II of the 1833 treaty and the payment of $3.9,1ie2" .03 for the
13,191.77 acres oi‘ the 150 sections not conveyed, it is the position

of defendant, as disclosed by its Amended Answer and its brief, that

in agreeing by said article to convey the land it was merely fulfilling
its legal obligation under the 1821} treaty, which was to provide the
Quapaw with a permanent home, and therefore, the value of the 82,808.23
acres actually conveyed to the Quapaw, plus the $39,1L23 .03 paid for the
deficiency, should be considered as a payment on the claim and deductiu
ble as authorized by section 2 of the Indian Claims Commission Act.

As we indicated in our opinion of March 11+, 1951, the 1833 treaty
was an entirely new transaction, complete in itself and, so far as the
obligations of the parties are concerned, was entirely independent of
the 1821:» treaty and derived and needed no support from the earlier
treaty to make it a complete and ‘binding obligation of the parties.

The purpose of the 1833 treaty was, as respects the land exchange, to
provide the Quapaw a suitable location in place of the uninha'bitable
one they obtained from the Caddo on the Red river. No doubt, when the
government learned of the condition of the q:.am'w resulting from their
location in the Gaddo country, it acted to alleviate the sufferings of
the Indians (see statement of Comssioners on p. 114-1, Pltfs. Ex. 63)
by greeing to give them a pemanent hone in a new location, and this
was done by the 1833 treaty. But such action lends no substance to

the defendant's claim that the l833 treaty (made some nine years later)
was simply osrsym out an obligation or the 18211 treaty to provide the
Qzapaw with a permanent home and thereby rake the value of the Ok'Lahoma-—Kansas land deductible as a payment on the claim. Moreover, the government

1 Ind. Cl. Comm. 644 555

gave the Qnapaw'no land in 182M; the land assigned to them by the
182M treaty was intended to be and was given them by the Caddo.
About this there is no question. what the boundaries of this land
were are not shown by the evidence but it is referred to in Article
I of the treaty of 1833 “as lands given them (Qnapaw) by the Caddo
Indians on the Bayou Treache of Red River," and Subnagent Richard
Hannum, who was a witness on the 1833 treaty, in a letter to the
President, dated May 13, 1833 (the day the treaty_was signed by the
Quapaw) referred to the location as “a piece of land on Red River."
That the land was of substantial value is shown by this statement
contained in the same letter:
“* * * On the score of policy the Government will

profit by the exchange, and their removal west of the

Missouri line or Territorial line, or into the country

set apart for the permanent settlement of the Indians,

for the reason that the Red River country is well adapted

to the raising of cotton, and when reclaimed by the removal of the Raft will afford a dense white population.”

(Pltfs.' Ex. 61.)

The value of the Red river land is not shown, so we must assume

that it at least equalledjthe value of the 0k1ahoma—Kansas land, conveyed or paid for.
Counsel for defendant calls our attention to Article V of the
1833 treaty which reads:
“It is hereby agreed, and expressly understood, that
this treaty is only supplementary to the treaty of 182%,

and designed to carry into effect the views of the United
States in.providing a permanent and comfortable home for

the Quapau Indians; '9' '5‘ ‘*3’

This provision, it is asserted by defendant, shows the 1833 treaty

was in reality a part of the 1821; treaty and intended to carry out

1, Ind. Cl. Comm. 644 656

the obligations thereof as to providing a permanent home for the
Quapaw. There is no substantial difference between the above provision
and that contained in Article II wherein it is provided that the conveyance of the 150 sections of 3am is "expressly designed to be in
lieu of their (Quapam) location on Red River and to carry into effect
the treaty of 1821}, in order to provide a permanent home for their
nation." Both provisions show a purpose to give the Quapaw a permanent
home, one that was habitable, and in that sense might be considered as
supplemental to the 1821} treaty, but the defendant by ‘the 1821; treaty
assumed no obligation in that respect for it fulfilled its obligation
when it moved the Quapaw to the Caddo country at a location given them
by the Caddo. The defendant was not legally responsible for the conditions that prevailed on the Red river and the fact that it later
recognized the intolerable situation the qaapaw found themselves in,
and relieved them of, did not change the defendant's contractual
obligations under the 1821; treaty. Had the defendant given the
plaintiffs land by the 1821! treaty it perhaps would now be entitled

to the value thereof, or the value of the land later substituted
therefor, as a credit on the claim, but , as the undisputed evidence
shows, the lands the Quapaw got were given them by the Caddo, as was
clearly contemplated by the l821I- treaty.

As an alternative basis for the credit for the land defendant
pleads and argues that it made the promises contained in the 1833
treaty under the mistaken conviction and belief that it was obligated
by the 1821+ treaty to provide the Quapaw a permanent and safe home,

and since it did not succeed in so doing it is entitled in equity to

1 Incl. c1. Comm. 644 657

credit for the value of the 82,808.23 acres of land it conveyed, plus
the amount paid for the deficiency in the'quantity of land it agreed
to convey, and other payments to the Quapaw'under the 1833 treaty.
This argument is based.upon the equity rule (Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence (Ed Ed.) Sec. 8M9) to the effect that where a person, ignorant
or mistaken as to his antecedent and existing private legal liabili- '
ties, enters into a transaction for the purpose of carrying out such
assumed liability, equity will grant him relief;i The rule is, of
course, founded upon mistake as to, or ignorance of, private liabilities. There is no evidence indicating that the government was either
mistaken as to or ignorant of its obligations under the 1821; treaty,
or that the 1833 conveyance was made on the assumption it was legally
required to do so by the earlier treaty. The proof appears to be to
the opposite effect and was to relieve the Indians from a condition
that neither the government nor the Indians had anticipated or was in
anywise responsible.

We see no basis for allowing defendant credit as a payment on
the claim for the value of the Quapawls Red river land, or for the
land and money it received in lieu thereof.‘

It is further pleaded and contended by defendant that it is entitled to offset the value of the 82,808.23 acres and the $39,123.03
paid for the deficiency under that part of section 2 of the Indian
Claims Commission.Act which permits deductions from an award,

"for all other offsets, counterclaims, and demands

that would be allowable in a suit brought in the

Court of Claims under section 1M5 of the Judicial
Code (38 Stat. ll35; 28‘U.S.C. sec. 250) as amended.”

1 Ind. Cl. Comm. 644“ 658

Section 1345 of the Judicial Code, referred to above, permits deductions

for,

"all offsets, counterclaims, claims for damages, whether

liquidated or unliquidated, or other demands whatsoever

on the part of the government of the United States against

any claimant against the government.“
This section was amended in 3.9113 (62 Stat. 911:2) and is new section 1503
of Title 28,lU}S.C.A., but there appears to have been no change in the
effect of the former section. b

Defendantis pleading and argument with respect to the application
of section 1M5 is somewhat involvedp but it seems to be based upon the
existence of a mistake on the defendant's part as to its obligations
under the 1821} treaty, that is, it mistakenly assumed that that treaty
obligated the government to provide a habitable and permanent location
for the Indians, and not having done so, was required to do what it
did to remedy the violation of the obligation and therefore, on equitable principles, is entitled to an offset for the value of the land
conveyed by the 1833 treaty and the amount it paid plaintiffs for the
deficiency. L

What we have said above concerning the, equitable defense there
discussed, applies here. There is no evidence sustaining the claim
that the governnent's‘action in conveying the Oklahoma-Kansas lands
by the 1833 treaty was the result of ignorance or mistake as to its

liabilities under the 182% treaty, therefore, the credits cannot be

allowed as an offset under said section 1H5.

OFFSETS-— OTHER THAN LA3D

Before considering the specific items claimed by the defendant as

l Inde C1. Comm.

Q

644

659

gratuitous expenditures and therefore offsets against the award, we

will first consider the law pertaining to offsets generally. The

provisions of section 2'of the Indian Claims Commission,Act (Act of

August 1 , l9M6, 60 Stats 1039), in so far as applicable here, is

as follows: C‘

"In determining the quantum of relief the Commission shall make appropriate deductions for all
payments made by the United States on the claim, and
for all other offsets, counterclaims, and demands that
would be allowable in a suit brought in the Court of
Claims under section 115 of the Judicial Code (36 Stat.
1136; 28 U.S.0s sec. 250), as amended; the Commission
may also inquire into and consider all money or property given to or funds expended gratuitously for the
benefit of the claimant and if it finds that the nature
of the claim and the entire course of dealings and accounts betwean the United States and the claimant in
good conscience warrants such action, may set off all

the claimant, except that it is hereby declared to be
the policy of Congress that monies spent for the removal of the claimant from one place to another at the
request of the United States, or for agency or other

administrative, educational, health or highway purposes,

or for expenditures made prior to the date of the law,
treaty or Executive Order under which the claim.arose,
* * * shall not be a proper offset against any award.“

These provisions fix the kind.and character of the offsets which.

the defendant is entitled against an award, and these offsets, when

pleaded and proven by the defendant, are allowable against all awards

made

by the Commission and it makes no difference whether they are

based upon legal or equitable principles, or on fair and honorable

dealings.

Passing for the present, deductions for payments on the claim

and those allowable under section lM5 of the Judicial Code, we shall

consider the sowcalled gratuities defined 81o?8 as "money or property

  '

1 Ind. (:1. com. 644 550

given to or funds expended gratuitously for the benefit of the claimant,"
excluding, however, certain excepted expenditures which will be considered
later.

The Court of Claims in Sioux Tribe v.'United States, 105 0. Ole.
725, 793, adopted this rule:

"An expenditure by the Government, in.order to be a
gratuity or a legal or equitable offset chargeable against

the Indians, must be one with respect to which the United

States has not assumed any obligation, direct or incidental, as a party to the treaty or in its sovereign capacity pursuant to the intention of the treaty."

The Court has consistently held that expenditures made pursuant
to treaty or contract obligations are not gratuities and cannot be
offset as such, and it makes no difference, it seems, whether the
treaty obligations may be enforceable by the Indians (given the right
to sue) or are merely gratuitous_promises, at least we find no cases
makizog such a distinction. See Warm Springs Tribe v. United States,
103 c. Cls. 71:1, 7117; Seminole Nation v. United States, 93 o. Cls.
50o, 525.532; Seminole Ration v. Unitedlstates, 102 0. 01s. 565;
Sioux Tribe v. United States, 105 C. Cls. 725; Choctaw v. United ._
States, 91 C. Cls. 320; Sisseton and Hahpeton v.'United States, Hée
C. Cls. H16, 208'U.S. 561. In these cases, except Sisseton etc.-V3
United States, which we will consider separately, the gratuity offsets were either allowed because they were not treaty or contractual
obligations, or disallowed because they were.

We now discuss Sisseton etc. v.'United States, supra, because

much reliance is placed upon it by the government,.and for the further

reason that it appears upon its face to be in conflict with the decisions

1 1nd. C1. Comm. 644 ' 661

of the Court of Claims cited above.

On July 23, 1851, 10 Stat. 9H6, the Sisseton and Wahpeton Bands
of Sioux Indians concluded a treaty under which they were to receive
for 50 years annuities in the sum of $73,600. On February 16, 1863,
12 Stat. 652, Congress declared the annuities forfeited because of a
sanguinary war carried on against the whites by the Indians. On
March 3, 1901, 31 Stat. 1078, an act was passed directing the Court
of Claims to report to Congress what annuities would be due the loyal
members of the bands if the act of forfeiture had not been.passed.
That court was

“further authorized to further consider, ascertain, and
report to Congress what lands, appropriations, payments,
gratuities, or other provisions have been made to or for
said bands or to any of the members thereof since said
act of forfeiture was passed. .A. And if said court shall
find that said bands preserved their loyalty to the United
States, they shall ascertain and state the amount that
would be due to said Indians on.account of said annuities
had said act of Congress of February sixteenth, eighteen
hundred and sixty~three, not been passed, stating in
connection therewith what credits should be charged against
said annuities on account of the lands, appropriations,

payments, gratuities, or other provisions as hereinbefore
stated."

The court, being unable to make the report requested by Congress,
Congress passed an act (June 21, 1906, 3% Stat. 372) extending or
enlarging the 1901 act and.authorizing that court to determine and
render judgment for any annuities that would be due the Indians under
the 1851 treaty if they had not been declared forfeited in 1863. The
court was also required»"to ascertain and set off against the amount found to be

due to said Indians, if any, all payments or other pro'visions of every name or nature made to or for said bands
'oy the United States, or to or for-any members thereof,

1 Ind. Cl. Comm. 644

since said act of forfeiture was passed, which are properly chargeable against said unpaid annuities."

By treaty of February l9,.April 22, 1867, 15 Stat. 50$, the Indians ceded rights of way through their land and in consideration of the
cession the government purported to set aside for them certain reservations. The treaty also contained this article:

"Article 6. And, further, in consideration of the
destitution of said.bands of Sissiton and warpeton Sioux,
parties hereto, resulting from the confiscation of their
annuities and improvements, it is agreed that Congress will,
in its own discretion, from time to time make such appropriations as may be deemed requisite to enable said Indians
to return to an.agricultural life under the system in operation on the Sioux reservation in 1862; including, if thought
advisable, the establishment and support of local and manuallabor schools; the employment of agricultural, mechanical,
and other teachers; the opening and improvement of individual
farms; and generally such objects as Congress in its'wisdom
shall deem necessary to promote the agricultural improvement
and civilization of said bands.“

Pursuant to this provision the government spent $h6M,953.H0 for the
benefit of the Indians and claimed the amount as an offset against the
reinstated annuities.

The Court of Claims allowed the offset for the following reasons
stated in its opinion, #2 C. Cls. H16, at page #31;

“It should be remarked that Article VI above was added
by the Senate as an amendment to the treaty as completed by
the Commissioner, and that the original treaty made no reference to the matters therein mentioned as to the consideration,
etc.

“The above amendment is a clear indication to our minds
that the Senate thereby intended that the suns so agreed to
be paid should be in lieu of the annuities ‘confiscated? by
the treaty of l”5l. This opinion is strengthened by the fact
that by a subsequent treaty, June 7, l8?2, the United States
paid the cla'nants $800,000 for a cession of the lands over
‘which the right of way was given. (17 Stat. L., 281.)”

1 Ind. Cl. Comm. 644   563

On appeal, The Supreme Court, in affirming the Court of Claims,
first said concerning the offsets generally:

"There are no general rules of law established for

deciding what payments properly are chargeable against

Indian annuities. The fact that payments of certain kinds,
or gratuities, have been granted in time of peace in addition
to annuities is not conclusive. There had been an.Indian war.
The'United States, in passing these acts, was doing shat it
pleased. In the earlier statute it plainly indicated that
the most sweeping deductions, including gratuities, were to
be made from its possible bounty. In the later one it qualified the deduction of payment by the words, ’which.are prom
perly chargeable against said'unpaid annuities,’ it is true.
But the careful particularity of the direction to set off
‘all payments or other provisions of every name and nature,‘
even if qualified as to the bands as well as to the particular members to whom some payments properly left out of
consideration had been made, shows that large set-offs still
were expected. It is said that the court was to proceed ‘as
if the act of forfeiture had not been passed.‘ But that was
only in ascertaining the amount of annuities that would be
due in that case, and in rendering a judgment that otherwise
would be unauthcrizedo Those words do not require the court
to treat all payments upon the fiction that nothing had
happened, or to give them a different complexion from that
which they had when they were made. Common sense, the then
recent decision of the court of claims as to the general
conduct of the bands, and the position of the words in the
section, show that they could have had no such intent."

and after holding that the words “in consideration of" as used in
Article 6 of the 1857 treaty did not import a technical consideration
but a "gratuitous promise induced by consideration of the Indians’
want," the court said;

"By the words of the treaty, then, the 6th article

promised the payments in question because the claimants

were in want because their annuities had been confiscated.
Or, striking out the middle tern and looking to the result,
the payments were made because the annuities had been confiscated; hat is to say, so far as appears, they would not
have been made except for that causes But, if so, then,

when the annuities are restored, the suns paid on the
footing that the ann ities were lost must be taken into

the account. It does not matter whether the Indians had

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 644 _ 664

a demand in conscience against the United States for
their cession or not, or whether or not such demands
qere settled by subsequent treaties; the sum stood on
its own ground and must be dealt with on the footing

on which it was paid.“
And closed the discussion in these words:

"The act of 1901 cannot be left wholly out of

sight in construing that of l906, and as has been said,

that act contemplated that eve y gratuity should be

brought in. We are not prenared to overrule the decision

of the court of claims on this point.”
Thus, it seems plain to us that both the Court of Claims and the
Supreme Court based the allot .ce of the offset on the fact that the
jurisdictional act definitely required the allowance. It is true that
the Supreme Court discussed the effect of the uords "in consideration
of" appearing in said.Article 6 and held that they did not create a
treaty obligation, but this was in connection with the Indians‘ argu~
ment that the expenditures under Article 6 really constituted the
consideration for the cession.because the recited consideration,
namely, the reservations, consisted of lands already owned by the
Indians. So while the Supreme Court decided the expenditures were
pursuant to a gratuitous promise, they were allowed because of the
special facts of'that case, and the construction by both courts of

the jurisdictional act. 3.1%. for the recj._u:E-rements of the juicisdictional

act the exoenditures under said Article 6 would, we believe, have been

}
-In

disallowed because they were treatjf obligations, therefore, we do not

consider that case authority for defendant‘s position here.

DEIUUCTIOEIS roe anrnrrs oz‘ TEL“ CLAIM

.As set forth in the abovouquoted part of section 2 of the Indian

1 Ind. Cl. Comm. 644 665

Claims Commission.Act, the Commission, “In determining the quantum of
relief * * * shall make appropriate deductions for all payments made
by the United States on the claim.“ Payments on the claim, since they
are treated specifically and separately from the other offsets, namely,
offsets, counterclaims and demands allowable under section 1M5 of the
Judicial Code and certain gratuities, must be something different from
the last-named classes of offsets. So, we are required to determine
what expenditures made by the government come within the phrase, "pay-.
ments on the claim."

It would seem that all expenditures the government agreed to mke
in a transaction with Indians involving a cession of land should be
considered "payments on the claim.” Otherwise, in cases where an award—
is made, for the full value of the land, as is the situlation here, it
would be unjust not to allow credit for what has'been paid to or expended for the Indian grantors as required by the treaty or agreement.
If such were not the intention the Indians would receive the full value
of the land plus all payments made by the defendant in fulfillment of
its promises. We conclude, therefore, that all payments made to or
expended for the Indian grantors by the government in fulfilling its
182M treaty or contractual obligations must be considered "payments on
the claim? and deductible from the quantum of the.award.

Treaty of 18234, deductions under.

.As shown by finding No. 13, the defendant paid, pursuant to Article
2 of the treaty of November l5, l82¥, 7 Stat. 232, $7,h50 on the annuities
and $h,00O for merchandise and goods. These items plaintiffs concede to
be proper offsets as payuents on the claim, and we agree.

But the payments, aggregating $2,000 to four Indian chiefs, are

l Ind. C1. Comm. 6&4 555

objected to by plaintiffs on the ground that the payments were not
made for the benefit of the tribe and should not be chargeable to it;
However, the payments were made as required by the treaty, and formed
part of the consideration. We believe they are payments on the claim
and must be allowed.
The defendant claims offsets in the amount of $3,558.73 for pay

of interpreters $500 as pay to the sub-agent, $1,307.98 for removal

1

_of Indians to the Caddo country, and $7,3M9.h6 for subsistence (corn,

meat and salt), as payments on the claim. (Finding No.'lM).

The plaintiffs oppose the allowance of the items for sub—agent
and interpreters because there was no treaty obligation of defendant
to provide a sub—agent and interpreters, and are, therefore, nonallowable gratuities under section 2 of the Indian Claims Commission
Act. Plaintiffs overlook the last sentence of Article 5 which required that “An Agent, Sub Agent, or Interpreter, shall be appointed
to accompany said Tribe, and to reside among them." The G.A.0. report shows that appropriations were made to pay such expenses beginning
in the calendar year 1825 and extending through lS33. (See Disbursement Schedules of G.A.0. Report, Nos. 9, ll, 12, 13 and lh).
These items must be allowed as payments on the claim.

The removal item in amount of $l,30?.98 is claimed as a deduction.
The treaty expressly limited the cost of transportation to a "sum not
exceeding one thousand dollars," so any expenditure over $1,000 was a
gratuity and within the exception of section 2 of the Indian Claims
Commission Act, since the evidence indicates that the Indians were

moved to the Caddo lands at the request of the defendant. The $1,000

1 Ind. C1. Comm. 644 667

must be allowed and deducted as a payment on the claim.

There remains the item of $7,3H9.U5 for corn, meat and salt.
In the treaty (Finding No. 1%) defendant agreed to provide the Quapaw
with said food for six months from January 1, 1826. This time was
evidently fixed because the qpapaw were required to commence moting
before January 20, 1826. (Article 3.) However, by the act of March 3,
1825, M Stat. 92, 93, the sum of $15,372 was appropriated "For the 1
purchase of provisions (for the Qnapaw tribe) for six months, as provided by the fifth article of said treaty "(l82‘-4), and the G.A.0.
Report shows that of the amount appropriated, $5,950.29 was expended
in 1825, and other sums aggregating $399.17 in the years 1832, 1833
and 183%, were expended for the same purpose but under different acts.
See Disbursement Schedules 7 and 1M of GeA.O. Report, Defendantis
Exhibit 90 . This item is also allowed as a deduction as a payment
on the claim.

We, therefore, allow defendant as an offset, deductible from
the award, for the expenditures made to or for the plaintiffs under

the provisions of the treaty of 182%, the total sum of $25,858.19.

Treaty of 1833, deductions under.

Under the provisions of'Article III of said treaty of May 13,
1833, the defendant made certain expenditures aggregating $9h,702.76
which the defendant claims were gratuitous expenditures and is therefore entitled.to credit therefor. (Par. 2¥(a) Amended Answer.)

The article is set forth in Finding No, 16 hereof. we shall now consider the several items making up said total.

l Ind. Cl. Comm. 644 I p i 653

Under the heading oi.igricoitora1.iid is an item or $138.00 for
clearing, breaking and fencing land. ‘Under said Article III the defendant agreed to provide a farmer to "aid and instruct them (the
Quapaw) in their agricultural pursuits.“ In the absence of a showing

to the contrary we believe this expenditure was made in pursuance of

,a treaty obligation and is not, therefore, a proper offset.

The defendant expended $2H0.ll for axes, hoes, and a wagon.

These items are expressly provided for by said.Article III, and the
expenditure therefor cannot be allowed as an offset.

Defendant claims credit for $5uo.36, listed in o.i.o. Report as
agricultural implements and equipment furnished during the years from
1869 to 1900. Said Article 11: reqiired defendant to provide 25 plows
and h ox carts, with all their necessary rigging. These items might
well come within the description of agricultural implements and equipment. Certainly they were necessary to conducting farming. They are
not allowed as offsets.

Rifles and shotguns were supplied at a cost of $727.25; said
article expressly required defendant to furnish the Indians with 50

rifles and five shotguns, powder and lead. These items were furnished

in 183% and must be presumed to be in fulfillment of the agreement,

e and therefore the cost thereof cannot be allowed as a credit.

‘Under the heading “Blacksmith and Shops" are listed in the G.A.O.
Report expenditures by defendant aggregating $61,962.32 for erection
and repair of shops, fuel, furnishing shop and tools, iron and steel,
pay of blacksmith, supplies and equipment, and tools. These expenditures wcre made as to some items beginning in the year 183% and

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 644  559

continued until as late as 1928, and all were made at irarions times
during those years]. In the 1833 treaty the defendant agreed to provide “a blacksmith to do their (Quapaw) necessary work, with a shop
and tools and iron and steel not exceeding one ton per year.“ We
find nothing; in the listed items that does not come within the quoted
provisions of the treaty, and for aught that appears to the contrary
all expenditures were made pursuant to those provisions. The claimed
offset for these items must, therefore, be denied.

Said Article III required defendant to furnish plaintiffs with
l00 blankets. According to the G.A.0. Report, pagel79, defendant
expended in 1831+ the sum of $311.85 for blankets for Quapaw pursuant
to the 1833 treaty, so this item in said amount cannot be allowed as
an offset.

According to the G.A.0. Report, pages 120 and 121, “cash payments
to chiefs and council in lieu of farmer" were made in a total sum of
$2,1%O0 during the years 1869, 1870 and l87l, and this sum is claimed V
as an offset. We believe this sum must be allowed because it no doubt
was to compensate the Quapaw chiefs and council for their services in
representing the tribe, which services were presumably of benefit to
those Indians. The defendant was under no obligation to pay them and
should be reimbursed for the outlay.

The defendant by said Article III agreed to furnish plaintiffs
with twenty iron hand cornrnills. In 1831} defendant expended $279 .36
for these mills. Obviously, this disbursement was pursuant to the
treaty obligation and cannot be allowed as an offset.

The defendant was also required by said Article III tofnrnish

so
1 Ind. C1. Comm. one 7

plaintiffs with 100 head each of cows, hogs and sheep, and 10 yoke of
working cattle. In 183M defendant purchased livestock for plaintiffs
to the amount of $2,859.08, in compliance with said article, therefore, that amount cannot be allowed as an offset.

Likewise, defendant, by said Article III agreed to furnish plaintiffs
looms, wheels, reels and wool-cards, so the expenditure therefor in the
sum of $165.79 may not be allowed defendant ee an offset.

The defendant by said Article III agreed to provide plaintiffs
with a farmer to reside with them and to aid and instruct them in their
agricultural pursuit. This the defendant did, and in the years from
l835 to 1863 expended for this purpose $15,072.01. The claim of the

defendant to offset this amount against the award must be denied.

C‘uUr uA

A small item of $43.00 for pay of laborer is shown. This expenditure was made in 1835 and appears to have been disbursed pursuant to
Article IV of said treaty, which required defendant to expend up to
one thousand dollars in hiring laborers to build and aid in the building of comfortable cabins and houses for the Quapaw. The item is not
allowed.

Another expenditure in the sum of $5,558.36 for "provisions" is
claimed as an offset. When we breakzthis amount down we find that in
,l836 defendant expended $h,097.85 for provisions for the Quapaw (page
lul, G.A.0. Report). Under said Article III defendant agreed to
"supply them with one year‘s provision from the time of their removal,
which shall be as soon as they receive notice of the ratification of
this treaty.“ The date the plaintiffs received notice of the ratifi~

cation.of the treaty is not shown; however, the tr Gtv was proclaimed

U

- Ind. C1. Comm. 644

671

April 12, 183k, so taking this date as the beginning of the_period
during which provisions are required to be supplied under the treaty
it is not even probable that the provisions supplied in 1836 were
provided under the treaty provisions. Likewise, the items making
up the total claimed being that of $300 provided in 1881, and that
for $1,l5h.51 expended in 1882 (G.A.0..Report, p. 1R5), being for
provisions, cannot be considered as paid'under the treaty. So defendant is a1lowed.a credit in the sum claimed, $5,552.36, asaa
gratuity.

During the years 1867, 1869 and 1872-1875, defendant expended
a total of $1,558.35 for “provisions in lieu of farmer.” (G.A.O.
Report, pp. 121 and 122). Just why the expenditures were thus
carried is difficult to understand because there were apparently no
farmers employed after the year 1863, at least no expenditures for
that purpose are shown in the report. It may be fairly Qoncluded,
however, that the expenditure was for subsistence and not required
by the treaty after the year 1835. We, therefore, allow the amount
as a gratuity.

An item in the sum of $2,185.00 expended by defendant in 1835i837 for removing the plaintiffs to their new home, is claimed by
defendant as an offset. The removal of the Indians was in pursuance
of the 1833 treaty and.Article III thereof expressly provided that
“they shall be removed to their new homes at the expense of the
United States." The expenditures having been made for an expense
contracted.for by the United States excludes it as a gratuitous offset. See also section 2 of Indian Claims Connission.Act, supra.

1 Ind. c1. Com. 644 672

Said treaty. also required defendant to furnish ‘plaintiffs with
"tools of different description to the amount of two hundred dollars.“
The expenditure in the amount of $160 .68 for tools in 1831} cannot be
allowed as an offset since it was expended pursuant to an obligation
er the treaty.

The last of the items listed in paragraph 23+(a) of defendant's
amended answer and claimed as an offset is $187.21}, disbursed for
transportation of treaty goods. All but $31L.,79 of this sum was disbursed during the three years following the execution of the 1833
treaty. That treaty provided that “the United States will also furnish
a.nd deliver to them (the Quapawi), after their arrival at their new

homes," the treaty goods described in Article III thereof. The re£H“l"‘V!J\vn:_3Iv\4-0 -I-inn-¥ -l-$- -3

\ihA-dv-i- c... A-LU .,......e V4.4‘ u.C «Lt3.l1..L.LS1:L and deii'v'er  treatgv goods

to plaintiffs after their arrival at their new homes clearly burdens
defendant with the cost of delivering the goods to the Indians and
is,‘ therefore, a treaty obligation of defendant and cannot be allowed
as a credit on the award.

Expenditures by defendant in.the total sum of $93,756.28 for
education is claimed (par. 25 of Amended Answer) as a deduction. The
items making up this total are set forth in statement No. 7, pages
88 and 89 of the G..A.0. Report, Defendant‘s Exhibit 90. Included
in the amount are the following items: clothing, $1,612.97; feed and
care of livestock, $5.85; funeral expenses, $2lL.OO; livestoclrz, $321.00;

provisions, $1,910.06 and unidentified items, $390.00; total, $h,763.s8.

Just how these items can be considered e:x:pend_i1mres for education is

l Ind. Cl. Comm. 644 673

not Qown, and we cannot so consider them. In any event, the defendant, by said Article III agreed to "appropriate one thousand
dollars per ym for education purposes" and beginning wi th the year
1833, and continuing as late as 1931 the defendant expended the sum
stated above in apparent fulzfillnenti of its obligation, although the
amount expended did not completely satisfy the obligation, even if
the above—questioned items are included, as being for "education purposes." Accordingly, the amount claimed cannot be allowed as a gra‘hiity because it is a treaty obligation; on the other hand, if it
were considered a gratuity, it is barred by section 2 of the Indian

Claims Commission Act .

Eztnenditures from November 15, 1821; to June 30, 1916.
By paragraph 26 of its Amended Answer, defendant claims as offsets a number of alleged non-treaty expenditures aggregating $145,301!-.77,
expended during the period from November 15, 1821+ to June 30, l91}6, inclusive. Included in the listed items are the following:

We have discussed the defendantis obligations under Article III
of the 1833 treaty, and it is not necessary to repeat what we have
said. We believe each of the above expenditures was made pursuant to
defendant‘ s agreement set forth in said article, and they cannot, therefore, be allowed as an offset.

1 Ind. C1. Comm. 644 - 674

There is also listed in the offsets claimed for the period 182%191i6 an expenditure of $128.93 for "maintaining law and order" and one
in the sum of $9,967.95 for "pay of interpreters.” These items are for
agency expenses and must be disallowed under the authority of the cases
of Sioux Eribe v. United States, 105 C. Cls.725, and Menominee V3 United
States, 118 C. Cls. 290, 326, and said section 2 of the Indian Claims
Commission.Act. Furthermore, Article 5 of the 182% treaty required the
defendant to providetan interpreter to accompany said tribe and reside
among them. This provision does not appear to be restrictive as to
either time or place.

Items for expenditures, totaling $31i,1i13 .72 are listed in finding
NO. 17. These items were for the exclusive benefit of plaintiffs, between the date of the.l82H treaty and June 30, l9d6. .All were given
the Qnapan and none was provided under either of the treaties involved
here, so defendant is entitled to credit for the total thereof. The
item amounting to $1,653.28 included in said list, for agricultural
implements and equipment, was for disbursements made in the years 1879
to 1901. No part of this sum was disbursed, according to the GsA.O.
Report, in fulfillmentof any treaty obligation but was disbursed out
of the Civilization Fund to the extent of $1,201.55 in the years 18801882, and the other items were disbursed from other funds in small
amounts. The items which can reasonably be considered agricultural
implements and equipment defendant agreed to supply in said Article III,

were provided and accounted for by name except a disbursement of $5HO.36

for "agricultural implements and equipment" which we have discussed above,

and decided it was for plows and or carts. So it would seem that the

1 Ind.  Comm. 645+ 675

expenditure of $1,653.28 was for implements and equipment not contem-»

plated by the 1833 treaty, and as we have said, the defendant is entitled to credit therefor as set forth in said list.

hoendimres for years 1826 to 1831+.

 

During the years 1826 to 1829, inclusive, and 1831!-, plaintiffs
were under the jurisdiction of the Red River Agency. No satisfactory
evidence is shown as to the Immber oi‘ Qlapaw or of other Indians at
that agency during those years, and in which the government expended
the en,125.13 for the benefit of all Indians under the jurisdiction of
that agency. The G.A.0. Report at pages 283-281: discloses the inadequacy of the information concerning the numbers of the several tribes

at that agency during the years in question. Under the circumstances,

we must disallow the offset claimed.

 

mnenditures for the years 1837 to 1867.

For the period from January 1, 1837 to June 30, 1867, the de-_
fendant expended for the Indians, including the Quapaw, the sum of
$870 .55. On a population ‘basis, defendant claims the porportionata
share of that sum chargeable to the Qiapanr is $161.31, that is, 18 .53
per centmn of the total. The items making up the total are, according
to the G-.A.0. Report, the fOll0t'!iI‘1é,'3

As to the charge for blacksmiths there is no evidence whatever
to justify even.an assumption.that the Qwapaw received any benefit
from this expenditure other than the fact these Indians were, with
many others, attached to the Neosha Subagency, but even if it were
assumed that the Qnapaw received their proportionate part of the-benefits derived from the $600 expended, they could not be allowed as an
offset because'under the provisions of drticle III of the treaty of

1833, defendant was obligated to provide a blacksmith for the Qnapaw

and it did so by'expending through the years 1835 to 1930 the total

sum of $52,158.67. While there appears to have been no expenditures
for a blacksmith for the Qnapaw, exclusively, in the years 186% and
1865, whatever benefit they may have received from the $600 claimed
above would have to be considered a fulfillment of the treaty obligation and not a gratuity, so no part thereof can be deducted. We
also deny credit for any part of the $51.00 for expenses of Indian
delegations and the $219.55 for provisions because we find no basis,
in the absence of evidence, upon which those amounts may be apportioned between the three groups under the Eeosho Subagency.

Exoenditures for years 186? to 1870 w Neosho Agency.

,The sum of $3,786.98 must also be denied as an offset for lack
of proof even remotely indicating the Quapaw received any part thereof. The principal item of this amount was $3,521.56 for “subsistence

of Friendly Indians.” This expenditure was from an appropriation of

1 End. El. Comm. 64$ 67?

$300,000 “to enable the Secretary of the Interior to subsist such

friendly Indians as may have separated or may hereafter separate themselves frcm the hostile bands or tribes and seek the protection of the
United States." Act of July 20, 1857, 15 Stat. 17. While the expenditure was no doubt made at the Neosho Subagency, we must presume it was
made in accordance with the act, and since there is no evidence that
the Quapaw or any part of them was hostile to the United States, or
separated from hostile bands of Indians, we must conclude that they

received no part of the $3,52l¢56 and, therefore, cannot be charged

therewith.

Defendant claims offsets in the aggregate sum of $l6l,HO7.0l for
expenditures made for the benefit of a number of Indian tribes, including the Qnapaw5 between the years from July 1, 1870 to June 30,
19%. (Statement H00 27, pp. 321-—322, ciao. Report). There has been
no showing as to the part expended for the Quapaw, and the defendant
asks thatpthe various amounts be prorated on the basis that the number
of Quapaw under the Quapaw Agency bears to the total of all Indians
under such.agency. We will now consider the various items making up

the total.

Tribe v. United States, 118 0. 01s. ago, 326, and section 2 of the

Indian Claims Commission Act.

Provi si ons .

 

In the statement No. 27, C~..i.0. Report, page 322, are two items
for "provisions." The first is in the amount of $5,055.57 and is made
up of expenditures made through the years from 1871 to 1890, inclusive.
The second is in the amount of $3,636 .60 and is made up of expenditures
made through the years from 1878 to 1945, inclusive. These items total
$8,692.17 and cover the cost and the transportation of food for the use
of the Indians of the Quapaw Agency. Providing food would seem to be
for general benefit of all Indians of the agency, and in which the Quapaw

should be charged with their proportionate part.

Pay and expenses of farmers,
Pay and expenses of farmers, $55,328.99, By Article III of the

1833 treaty, defendant agreed to provide a farmer to reside with the
Quapw and to aid and instruct them in their agricultural pursuits,
such farmer to be continued only so ‘long as the President deemed necessary. In a breakdown of the item of $15,072.01 for "pay of farmers"
(p. 89, C—..d.0. Report), heretofore considered, we find that beginning
with the year 1835 and ending with the year 1863, defendant spent about
$500 a year, on the average, for "pay of farmers," and according to the

report the eyetpenditures were made in “fulfilling treaties with the

J

QUE‘-paw.“ Since no e:-penditures of this character are show; to have been

1 Ind. Cl. Comm. 644 679

made expressly for the Quapaw after the year 1863, we presume defendant

fulfilled its obligation in that respect, under the 1833 treaty. There- '

fore, no part of the said $55,328.99 can be considered a treaty obligation of defendant to the Quapaw. This.item is disallowed, however,

on the authority of the Menominee case, supra, which holds such expenditures to be educational on the absence of proof to the contrary, and
therefore within the exception of section 2 of the Indian Claims Commission.Act.

Pay of blacksmith.

 

For "pay of'blachsmith“ an offset in the amount of $27,2M3.31 is
claimed by defendant. (GeAe0. Report, p..32l). A.breakdown of this
total shows that the expenditures began in the year 1895 and extended
through the year l9Mh. We have shown, in.discussing expenditures made
under the 1833 treaty that between the years 1835 and 1932 defendant
had.expended, pursuant to treaty obligations, $52,158.67 for blacxsmiths, and this sum was expended for the sole benefit of the Quapaw.
Of this sum over $17,000 was expended between the years 1895 and 1932.
It does not seem.that the Quapaw would have derived any benefit from
the agency expenditures during the period they were receiving direct
and independent aid of the same character from defendant under the
1833 treaty. There is, therefore, no way of determining what, if any,
part of the $27,2h3.3l the Qnapaw received. we must, therefore, disallow this item. See Menominee case, supra, page 325.

Clothing.

 

In 1880, defendant purchased for the Indians clothing in the sum

 1 Ind. c1. comm. 644 680

of $3.90, and between the years 1878 to l9M5, defendant furnished
clothing in amounts ranging from eight cents to as high as $78.80,
in different years, aggregating $365.70. These items, it seems to
us, because of the smallness thereof in the various years, were for

individual Indians rather than for tribal benefits, so, we are disallowing the clothing items.

Miscellaneous Items.

The above items can fairly be said to have been provided for the
Indians, generally, under the jurisdiction of the qpapaw.Agency, and
that the various tribes governed by that agency benefited by such
expenditures in proportion to their respective numbers.

1The Court of Claims has in.a number of cases held that where public
funds have been expended gratuitously for the benefit of a number of
tribes, and the records of the expenditures do not show the part expended for a particular tribe, the amount may be determined on a popuLation basis. Seminole Nation v; United States,-93 0. Ole. 500;

The defendant has made a painstaking tabulation of the Indian popu1ationtand.gratuitous disbursements made for the Indians under the Quapaw
Agency for the years from 1871 to 19u5, inclusive, and reached the result that dnring that period the Quapaw Tribe constituted l6.Hl per

centum of the population of Indians under.that agency. (See EX. D,

l Ind. C1. Comm. 644

page 19 of Amended Qamended Answer"). While this percentage is the
average for the period we believe it fairly represents the porportion
0f’Qnapaw'in that agency.

To summarize: There is allowed, of the expenditures from 1871 to
1996 for the Indians'un0er the Qnapaw.Agen0y, the sum of $8,692.17 for
provisions, and $26,999.12 for miscellaneous expenditures, a total sum
of $35,691.29 of which the plaintiffs are chargeable with 16.91 per
centum thereof, or $5,856.93.
