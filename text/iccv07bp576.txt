FIbIDII~IGS OF FACT
Statement
These consolidated petitions each state two causes of action against

the United States, onearising out of the cession on July 6, 1820, (7 Stat;

207) of the St. Martin Islands in Lake Huron by the Ottawa and Chippewa

Nations of Lndians, and the other arising out of the cession on March 28 ,
1836 , (7 Stat. 1491) by the same parties of that portion of the northern
peninsula of Michigan east of the Chocolay  Escanaba rivers, together
with the approximate north and west two-thirds of that part of the south.
ern .penins1:J_a of Michigan lying north oi’ the Grand and Thunder Bay rivers.
‘the ceded areas are identified as Areas ]_'L3 and 205,- respectively, upon
R03/'ce‘s Map l of I*Eichiga_n, Vol. 18, B.-9.33., Area 203 includes within its
outer boundaries Area 3.13 and several other tracts of land acquired by the
United States prior to 1836.

The Commission makes the following Findings of Fact:

 

7 Ind. Cl. Ccrrm. 576 577

l. The Ottawa and Chippe:-:a moved into Michigan from the east and
northeast, replacing an earlier zzzound-buildirg people. The Ottawa sett..ed
about Lake Superior and in 1673 some 1,300 of then, together with 500 Hurons settled within Area 205, south of the Straits of Mackinac. Their

U?

Q!‘

canoes carried than south along Lake 1-13.chigan’s shores to hun.ting grounds
far south on the headwaters of the Mississippi river and near Chicago.
Beginning with LU-irbre Croche in l7h2, by 1835 they had permanent settlements within Area 205 along the Grand river°and near the mouths of the
principal rivers north of the Grand. ttawa from Manitoulin Island penetrated the region about Detroit and made permanent settlerne nt there by
171?. ilieamvhile the Chippe:-:.a were on the northern Michigan peninsula.
They evicted the, Sac about Saginaw Bay and had permanent sett...ements there
by 1716. Before 1826 they had pe ....anent villages on the Cheboygan and

at the mouth of Big Thunder and Au Sablegrivers. pp It appears the two intermingled to some extent in their use of the northern portion of the
southern peninsula. An early sketch shows it divided between them by a
 draw:-In south from hiatcicinac, the Chippewa on the east and the Ott ‘ea
on the west. Fiowever an Ottatza camp was .i‘ound_ton_ the Au Sable in 1820 ,
only a mite  a Chippewa village. It is Ottawa tradition that they
gave the Chipper-Ia permission to use the southern peninsula. According

to the Ottawa author, Blac‘.<bird3 ° the Chippewa were given a strip 30 to

140 miles wide across the lower Leelanau peninsula, thence between parallel I

*1

lines to the headwaters or. the Muskegon river. Only two late reports,

one in 1830 and one in l835; refer to Chi pera villages in this vicinity,

however, Both these reports locate Ch'@e'«.-Ia on the Manisteeg river, one

Tfrddence identi.f.‘yi_ng the Indians occupying the various islands with  205' 3 confusing. It begins with Father Marquette locating Chip  on Summer, St. Martin‘s and Washington Islands in Lake Michigan in
I  Chippewa were reported on Mackinack Island in 1779; they ceded it
   1781, but both Ottawa and Chippewaifrequented the trading
posts and agencies maintained on the island thereafter. Ottawa and
Chippewa Nations of '-Detroit ceded Bois Blane Island in 1786; the Chippewa Nation gave it to the United States in the Greenville treaty of
1795, but Ottawa" claimed it in 1799. Both Ottawa and Chippewa acknowledged the validity of the 1795 gift in 1831; when they requested some remuneration for it because they were impoverished. The Chippewa ceded

Isle Ronde to a Chippewa woman in l8lh; they inhabited it inql83h;. They

occupied Drtmziorxci Island in 1815, hilt the Ottawa were  in 1835, and

claimed compensation due them for it in 1831; and 1835 although it was

then abandoned. Chippewa used Beaver Islands in 1763 and were there in

1815; 1820*, ehd 182b,, but ottaue Luddans occupied itttin 1825.’ The first

reference to  Islands E Lake Huron, or   Islands
33 they were also referred to _, appears  Alexander Henry's report of
having 3138115 two weeks there with an Ottawa family during August of l7d3
follo-.;ing the sack of I-Iichilinackinac. The Chippewa are said to have

2. No political entities existed in 1820 and 1836 which embraced

all the Indians in the ethnic and cultural groupings described as either

Ottawa or Chipp eea Eations or tribes of Indians. They were each Algonquin people, speaking different but mutually intelligible languages

and when known to the white man they were composed of separate, independent, autonomous groups or bands which were known by names having

. references to their leaders - or geographical locations. They‘ intermarried,

and some villages contained both Ottawa and Chippewa. Their principal

food was fish but they utilizedberries, fruits, nuts, seeds and wild

p rice, obtained a varie ‘of of wild fish andlfowl frcxn the““numerous lakes

0

and streans and by the 19th century raised potatoes, , beans

and corn, made sugar from the sap of the maple tree and hunted beaver,

martin, mink, otter, mnskrat, deer, rabbits, and other game for meat

and for the fur trade which was instigated dur@ the 17th centurypby

the French and cultivated in ash by the English and Americans.
Within Area 205 their villages were along the shores and lakes,

near the mouths of the principal river, and their gardens were planted

nearby. After harvest the men hunted in the interior regions. By

 

7 Ind. Cl. Comm. 576 p -- ‘ S80

the 19th century Chippewa on the northern peninsula went west, and the
ttawa went south along the shores of Lake Michigan as far as Chicago
and the headwaters of the Mississippi, caching their birch canoes near
the mouths of the rivers and walking inland some 70' to 80 miles. In
the spr'ng they packed their winter‘s catch of fur and meat, rendered
oil, and personal belongings back to the shore, made their maple syrup,
and with the melting of the ice theyretrieved their canoes and returned to their villages and the fur market at Michilimackinac. Gradually the Ottawa began wintering farther south, and by 1821 separate,

independent bands resided in permanent villages along the Grand river.

11. (a) Following its policy ‘of treating with the Indians in possession of or claiming the areas involved, between January 21, 1785,
and March 3 , 1871" when further Indian treaties were forbidden, the

United 3tates entered into LL14 separate treaties with Ottawa and Chip""'2.w'e_

pews. Indians. In each treaty the particular band or plurality of bands
IU:'C1-........__L\

r spoke for itself through the words "nation,“ "tribe,“ and "band" and

 

their plurals, were used synonymously to define the Indians treated
with.

(b) The first three treaties negotiamd with Chippewa and Ottawa
Indians included other named Indians, and were negotiated one at Fort
Mi 1'-I1’C-Osh, January 21, 1785, 7 Stat. 16, one at Fort Hamar, January 9,
1789, 7 Stat. 28,  one at Greemrille, Cfhio, -on August 3, 1795, 7 I
Stat. 1&9. In the first two treaties the United States reserved the
Post of Michilimackinac and its dependencies within the  country.
A third effort to effect a peace, establish aboundary between the Indian country and the United States, and secure military and trading
post sites within the Indian country, resulted in the i'o]_'Lowi_ng ces35-°nS aPP€’-'3-I'ing in Article 3, itenl3 of the Treaty of 1795:

(13) The post of Iviichillimackinao, am all the land on the

island, on which t. at post stands, and the main land adjacent,
of which the Indian title has been extinguished by gifts or

7 Ind. Cl. Cosme S76 . . 582

grants to the French or English goverr:nents3 and a piece of

land on the main to the north oi‘ the island, to measure six

miles on Lake Huron, or the strait bet:-teen Lakes Enron and

Michigan, and to extend three miles back from the water of the

lake or strait, and also the island De Bois Blanc, being an

‘extra and voluntary gift of the Chippewa Nation.
The areas thus described are those identified as Areas 21., 22 and 23 3
upon Royce‘s Map l of Michigan, Vol. 18, B.A..E. The United States
agreed to pay $31,000 in goods annually to each the Chipper.-Ia and Ottawa
and similar annuities to other Indians.

(c) On June 16, l820, 7 Stat. 206, the Chippewa Indians ceded to
the United States a tract at the Sault Ste. Marie, f0ImeI‘1Y.0C°‘lP5-ed by
the English, and on July 6, 1820, 7 Stat. 207, the St. Martin Islands
were ceded by the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. These cessions are identified as Ereas 112 and 113, respectively, upon Royce’s Hichiga-I1 1 Ma?The five cessions, Areas 21, 22, 23, IL2 and ll3, all lie within

the outer boundaries of Area 205.

5. Earea 205 was ceded to the United States by the Chippewa and

Ottawa Nations of Indians on March 28, 1836. The treaty was proclaiizied 3

Ma)?’ 27, 1836. The ceded area was described as foI!_'Lot-:s: ,

Beginning at the mouth of Grand river of Lake Michigan on
the north bank thereof , and i‘ ollowing up the same to the line
called for, in the first article of the treaty of.‘ Chicago of the
29th of August 1821, thence, in a direct line, to the head of
Thu.nder—bay river, thence with the line established by the treaty
of Saganat-I of the Zhth of September 1819, to the mouth of said
river, thence northeast to the boundary line in Lake _Huron between the United States and the British province of Upper‘ Canada:
thence northnesttrardly, follox-ring the said line, as established
by the commissioners actmg under‘ the treaty of Ghent, through
the straits, and river St. I'I€.r'y’s, to a point in Lake Superior
north of the mouth of Gitchy Seebing, or Chocolate river, thence
south to the mouth of said river and up its channel to the Source
thereof, thence, in a direct line to the head oi‘ the Skonaifba

river of Green ‘Day, thence down the south ‘oank of said river to
its mouth, thence i a direct line, thmugh the ship channel into
Green bay, to the outer part thereof, thence south to a point in
Lake Michigan west of the north cape, or entrance of Grand river,
and theme east to the place of beginning, at the cape aforesaid,
comprehending all the lands and islands, within these limits, not

hereinafter reserved.

(a) The following reservations appear in Articles Second and Third:

Article Second. From the cession aforesaid the tribes reserve for their own use, to be held in common the following tracts
for the term of five years from the date of the ratification of
this treaty, and no longer; unless the United States shall grant
them permission to remain on said lands for a longer period, namely: One tract of fifty thousand acres to be located on Little
Traverse bay; one tract of twenty thousand acres to be located on
the north shore of Grand Traverse Bay, one tract of seventy
thousand acres to be located on, or, north of the Pieitzz-e_ h'ar=quetta river, one tract of one thousand acres to be located by
Chingassanoo, -— or the B3 Sail, on the Cheboigan‘. One tract
of one thousand acres, to be located by I-Iujeekeuis, on Thunderbay river. ' I

Article Third. There shall also be reserved for the, use of

longer period, that is to say: Two tracts of three miles square
each, on tm north shores of the said straits, between Point-auBarbe and I-1il_'Le Coquin river, including the fishing ' grounds in
front of such reservations ,to be located by a council of the
chiefs. The Beaver islands of Lake Michigan for the use of the
Beaver-island Indians . Bound island, opposite Mich3'_limackinac,s
as a place of encampment for the mdians, to be under the charge

locatiom, leftindefinite by this, and the preceding articles,
shall be made by the proper chiefs, under the direction of the
President. It is understood that the reservation for a place of
fishing and encanpment, made under the treaty of St. Mary‘ s of
the l6th of June 1820, remains unaffected by this Treaty.

6. As originally executed the treaty of cession of l836 provided

that the above reservations should be permanent. Prior to its approval,

it was amended by the Senate of the United States, and, among other things,
the reservations provided therein were limited in duration as above recited, and a provision was included in Article Fourth providing that the
defendant should pay to the Chippewa and Ottawa Indians:

-11‘ =~"- the sin of two hundred thousand dollars, in consideration
of changmg the permanent reservations in article two and three
to reservations for five years only, to be paid whenever their
reservations shall be surrendered, and until that time the interest on said two hundred thousand dollars shall be annually
paid to the Indians. s . _ s ‘

Thereafter Henry'R._ Schoolcraft, as Treaty Ccmmissioner was instruct»ed to and did snmit‘me' Semte amendments to the Ohippet-zaandi Ottawa Indians at a council called at.Michilim.ackinac on Mackinac Island,i'and between    and July 22,: 1836, as chiefs and delegates arrived,
said amended I was iaPi3I‘ov.ed by the execution of  izzsitrurnent entitled "Articles of Assent”, the first paragraph of  provided: T T

Survey and settlement, (as the white population advances frcm the
South tcxarards the North); and considering that no part or provision
of the treaty of the twenty eight of March, which is not specified
in the Senate's resolution is, in any manner, affected or altered
thereby, hereby cede to the United States, from and after the
e3€P5:r‘ation of _r'_"ive ‘Years from the date of said resol tion, the several reservations made in the second and thud articles of
the said treaty, and agree to receive the sun of Two hundred thou

sand dollars offered by the Senate of the United States in consideration of the same. Provided, that the interest on said sum
be annually paid to then, agreeably to the tenor of the said
reso3.ution of the twentieth of ‘hay eighteen hundred and thirty

Tao hundred thousand dollars, is to be paid to them, until the
reservations are actually surrendered, and that this sum, when so

0

paid and also the interest to be annually paid thereon, in the *
interim, shall be divided among the local bands agreeably to the

ratio fixed for the payment of the annuities in the fourth article
of said treaty.

7. In the treaty oi"Septe:nber 211, 1819,  Stat. 203, referred to
in Article First of the 1836 treaty as quoted in FindingNo. S hereinabove,
the Chippewa Indians ceded a large tract (Royce 133.) in eastern Michigan,
the south boundary of which starts on the west line of the 1807 cession,
7 Stat. 105 (Royce 66), at a point six miles south of the Michigan Base
line and extends west 60 miles, from whence said boundary runs north€8.ster?.y  the head of Thunder Bay river, crossing the main branch of
the Grarxi river about 2 miles west of Saranac, Michigan. By the treaty
of August 29, 1821, 7 Sta . 218, also referred to in said treaty of
1836 as hereinabove quoted, there was ceded toithe United States a

are. distinguishable from the Ottawa of. Grandhiver. It was found I10
annuities were paid to Grand River Ottawas or‘ to any other Ottawa bands
in Michigan prior to 1821; that therieafter the Grand River bands annually received 3700 until the treaty of July 31, 1855, with the “Ottawa
and Chippewa Indians" released all annuities, for the "sum oi‘ $35,000,
in 10 annual i.nstal'*_vI1ents of $3,500 each to be paid only to the Grand
River Ottawas." O

10. With tm appointment of Lewis Cass in 1816 as Territorial

7 Ind. Cl. Conn. 5? S88

Governor in Michigan and of Hen. ' Schoolcraf t in l822 as Indian Agent,

the separate groupings of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians became the subject

' of careful study by Schoolcraft; He was particular that annuities were

paid those entitled to then and to have in attendance at the treaty cotul-c:"_'Ls
competent representatives from each of the groups or bands interested
in the subject. matter under consideration. ‘However, both the social
aspects of the occasion and the presents usually‘ dstrihuted at such
meetings resulted in many Indians attending these councils who were not
interested in the subject matter being considered.

Schoolcraft as Indian Agent and as Superintendent was familiar with
the various divisions of both 0t‘ T.-.-‘a. and Chipper-za Indians, when in 1831.:
on August 18 he wrote the Acting Superintendent at Detroit about a council
that day held with Ottawa and Chipper-za Indians in the vic initj of I*IichiILimackinac, concerning the land grants in the I795 treaty, commenting that
they “fully recognized these gents ihcluding the confirmed claims of the
French;“ that “eleven thousand acres, or half a township, is the grant
agreed on as the concession to be given with the old post, on the peninsula," that the Indians were aware they had no right to claim provisions,
Presents or blacksmith services at Mackinac, but that:

the chiefs obs erve that the island of Boisblarr: was iven as

31 .2. - II 3 3 gratuity (over & above the other gmnts) at the treaty of

Greenviile by the Chippewas, who were then its occupants at a

tame when their means were aaple, and they ‘thought little of the

annuity to depend on, and they therefore ask of th 

and of  s:T§3 Council, whether it could not be considered
due to their present improverished state, to grant then, again

atthis office. (Flt. E-:. 52). (underscoring supplied)

Years later, in his "Personal Memoirs,“ Schoolcraft again stated
that the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians who signed the treaty oi‘ 1836 were
"without one dollar in anrruities” at the time. (Def. Etc. 3 , p. Lr.83,.
Dkt. ho-F)

11. On July 31, 1855', IL Stat. 6Z1, the "Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan, parties to the treaty of March 28, 1836“, entered
into a treaty whereby certam public lands were to be set aside for use

ozrmended that such title he e:..tinguished. He was authorized to expend
up to $600 for this purpose and issued a Commission to treat with the
Indians on June l, 1820. On the 12th the Governor directed Indian agent
‘Boyd at Iiichilinaclzinac to effect the "purchase from the ttawa chiefs
who claim these lands when they meet here" at I-iichilimaclcinac. There;
after Mr. dchoolcraft visited St. Martin Islands, and on July 6., 1820,
‘Agent Boyd negotiated a treaty at Lharbre Croche ”with the chiefs of
that partof the Ottawa Indians, 1-zico reside here, for the purchase of

to the Reverend Jedidiah horse who was present ani who noted in his
Journal that the Island had valuable timber and d uring the council a
chief had suggested since the government wanted only the Plaster of
Paris, that should be given to it ‘out the Indians should retain the
soil and timber. In his for".-rarding letter Boyd told governor Cass, on
59Ptemher 9, 1820, that he was enclosing " the original instrmnent of

ceesion, by the Ottawa and Chippe:-Ia Chiefs, of the St. 1‘-Eartin Islands

'-‘ichigan. Where $300,000 worth of furs cleared Detroit
in l822, John Jacob Astor was considering abandoning his post there in
‘"1827, and that sane year, after a tour of the Great Lakes region the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs reported the Indians in a state of starvation due, he said, to their failure to preserve fish caught in season
and the general failure of game. He estimated there was only $25,000
worth of fur in the whole country along Lake Superior and said it was

H beingrapidly killed off. He commented:

But such are the precariousness and dispersion of the (game)
supply as to keep the whole population of men; women, and children in perpetual vacillation in its search. 'n‘’' '35 Seasons of scarcity and ':-..-ant are among the ordinary occurrences of every year; a
mere subsistence is the best state of things that is looked for.

During 1829 the Grand River bands petitioned the President to move
west, because" they heard, they said, "our children cr;,ri.I1g with hunger,
and can find no game where:-Iith to satisfy their wants - -» it." And when

cozrrnenting upon the terms of the 1836 cessions, Schoolcraft in his ofIIficial report as Treaty Corzunissioner referred to the ceded “surplus

oak, and maple, with a few conifers, pine balsam, cedar and tamarac.
North:-rard the conifers become more thick and gradually predominate,
with stands of deciduous trees inte “Bed. The country is. either
sandhill or plains, and there are either heavy forests or a scarcity of
vegetation according to Wilbert 3. Hinsdale, Huseurn of Agthropology,
University of I-iichilgan, in his "Distribution of the Aboriginal 'P.epu.lation of Michigan“ published in 1932. Sub-areas “U" and "S" are heavily
wooded with conifers or pine trees and comprise the table of a fairly
level area l,0OO to 2,000 feet in elevation, surrounded by a rolling
morain sand that reaches out to within one to forty’-five miles of the
coast. Higgins arri Houghton Lakes, in the northeast portion of Sub-area,
"U" are roughly within 50 miles of Saginaw Bay to the southeast and Treeverse Bay to the northwest, about 85 m£es east of Lake Michigan and the
mouth of the Muskegon River is some llO miles away, all by direct measurements. t

1-Iizsdale calls this inner region the “pine country proper" and he
pointed out that animals whose flesh is used for human food can not subsist upon resinoid kinds of trees; that there was litt_..e meal or bird

life in this area. He thought along the Au Sable River one would pmbably

and garden plots are located by Hinsdale in his l93l Archeological Atlas
of Michigan. He fails in most ix:-stances to ide.tify the Indians concerned
or to affix occupancy dates but it is known the mounds reflect a culture
predatfmg 1820. No excavations, earth:-Iorks, or garden sites arelocated
within Sub-areas "U“ and “S” but burial sites are noted near Hcughton
Lake and it is said 8-U one time the ttawa and Chippewa had a fierce
battle here over user rights. Among numerous trails Hinsdale reports
there is one from Saginaw Bay, which passes along the eastern side of

reliance upon Hinsdale’s nork. He located other sites also, some so
U931‘ Hinsdale‘s as to suggest duphcation, especially since Hihsdale
had access to all presently ava:«'_la'ble data. Neither Hinsdale nor‘Stewart differentiated between villages and camp sites, and their maps re- '

because as much as 25' yearsilater the annuit:,r rolls reflect that an'nuitant groups or bands resided there. Three sites based on these late

annuity rolls are the one at Evarts in the soutlu-Iest"corner of Subarea "U", one north of Remus near the west side of Sub-area W8", and
 Greenvi_'L1e site on Flat river southof these areas. Stewart
has identified village and camp sites along the Muskegonlriver i.n'Neway-—
go County which existed about 1819 and where a trading post stood in
1835. He identified Mecosta, Michigan as the point where Blackbird, an
Ottawa Chief, formerly hunted, and attached antiquity to it because in
1888 an Indian corps”e was rettn-ned there for burial. Dr. Stewart concluded that all of Royce 205 was held under Indian title by the plaintiffs. I t

(b) Defendant's expert witness, Dr. En.-xizgie Voegelin, testified in
effect that to consider Sub-areas "U" and 8'6" as occupied and used by
plai_nt&f  is to ignore their basic economy and the restrictions
such as economy imposed; She called attention to there being no 
posts in these areas, commenting upon Ida Johnson's failureto support her  line on Map 3 in her "Tradi_ng8wPosts of the American Fur
Company“, which supposedly indicates the interior range of such posts 3
that at the cession date the Indians were still tralkil‘-8 70 ’00 80 B153-93 5-11land to their winter hunting camps (except along Grand river); that traders
usually set up their posts about to miles inland and covered a radius of
1:0 to 50 miles around while trading with the Indians.

Dr. Voegelin placed much emphasis on -E-J.‘.-.8 reports of a topographical

party which the government directed in l83l; to select a suitable route for

a road  oaginlw to hackinac. In Midland county that party auployed as
a guide the Sagir-.a'.»:r Indian trader, Benganjn C. Williams. A belief c ..mon to the Sagiraw and their traders was that the region north of the
‘I‘itta'o'“:.-'assee river was one of

exters ive qualcing marshes, that extended great distances east

and west, and that were from four to six miles in width, wit

small tamarack in places, and where a man could shake the marsh
a considerable distance around. '

The party left the “upper forks" of the Tittabawassee and traveled
directljr north to Au Sable river. A few men rafted do:-mstream to meet
asupply boat coming upstream and found the first signs of Indian presence onthe second day. From their point of arrival at the Au Sable, ‘

the part; went north:-rest until they struck a trail along a small stream

running into Black Lake on the Cheboygan river, where they found an

 village. Theirroute north of the Tittabaz-rassee ran through

such dense forests they hadrdifficulty finding forage for their horses
or evenvtraveling. About twenty miles from the Au Sable they entered

and no evidence of Indian penetration between the two rivers. Dr.

 these and other facts Dr. Voegelin did not think plaintiffs used

Sub-areas "U" and "S", but that the latter may possibly have been used

of these rivers were in pine lands largely. Although game was plentiful
there,» yet the things dear to  Indian hearts were to be found in greatest abundance only on the loser courses of the waterways."
