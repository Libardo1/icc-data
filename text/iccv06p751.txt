OPINIOI’ OF THE COHIVIISSIOBE

Witt, Chief Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.
The questions for determination are the proper date for valuation
of the land involved, its fair market value on that date, and whether

the amount paid for it by the defendant was unconscionable.

i-Ind. Cl.Com. 730 752

Defendant acquired the land under a treatyxvhich provided that

.L amnld become obligatory upon the parties thereto when it was rat.fied by the United States. Under the precedent of Kootenai vs;
*nited States, Ind. Cl. Com. Dkt. l5h, the ratification date of April
.7, 1854, becomes the date of valuation.

The real estate involvsd is a h,982,097.87-acre tract in northeastern Nebraska bounded on the south by the Platte River and on the
.orth and east by the Missouri River. It has a g°°d growing 593503:
‘air rainfall and nominal temperature extremes. The terrain is printipally rolling with an elevation of from.l,00O to 2,000 feet and there
.s some overflow land along the rivers. It has 3,622,5h9.39 acres Of
.gricultural land and 697,337.94 acres which should be cropped only inr
.ermittently, 533,553.13 acres of good grazing land and l28,6h7.hl

:'with but sparse vegetation according to l9h2 SurVeYS Conducted
.y the Nebraska Experimental Station. Ten acres have not been class_fied. In 185A the soil would have appeared less subject to erosion
.nd more productive than its recent classification due to an undis;urbed residual deposit of native grasses then upon it.

Petitioners claim the tract was worth $1.50 per acre in 1854.

The defendant's valuation.witness divided it into five parts: choice
;racts lying along the Missouri and Platte rivers, worth $2 per acre;
iigh quality land near the choice tracts, near timber and water transnortation, $1.25 per acre; medium quality land near streams, with some

;imber but removed from.water transportation, 70; per acre, poor qual~1Y land with little or no timber and soil unsuited to settlement,

6- Ind.Cl. Com. 730 753

25¢ per acre; and very poor land, with no .timber , removed from
water transportation, and hilly, lO¢ per acre, or an overall
average of 55¢ per acre.

As we stated in I-Zia:-;=i Tribe of Oklahoma vs. United States,

1. Ind.‘ 01. Com. 3z.6,z.o1:

The weight to be given to opinion evidence depends upon

the qualifications of the witness in the field in which

he testifies and whether he takes all relevant factors

into account and the correctness of the facts upon which

the opinion evidence is based; and whether the ssuraptions

made by the witness are proper and supported by facts.

'-mhe appraisal can only be properly evaluated by giving

consideration to the qualifications of the witness in the

light of the true facts upon which based.
See, also, 20 Am. Juris., Sec. 1206, 1207, 1208.

The parties agree that the proper valuation method is the fair
market approach. They seem agreed that fair market is that price
agreed upon by a willing seller and a willing purchaser who are
each well informed and under no compulsion to perform. The material variation between the two conclusions of the valuation witnesses appears primarily due to the limited material taken into consideration by Mr. I-Eurray and to Fr. Davis ‘ insistence upon giving
consideration to the sales hhbory of the Omaha cession land as it
is reflected in deed records over a period extending more than
twenty years after the appraisal. date, with no consideration given
to changing conditions in that period which would contribute to ‘a

higher land value. The fair market value of the Omaha cession land

as of the appraisal date lies between the respective valuations of

these witnesses,

6—Ind.Cl.Com. 730 75;,

Mr. Davis has partially relied upon actual sales involving the
Jmaha cession land which occurred from 1853 through 1875, which
sales he has broken down into various types over varying periods.
Jpon the reasoning that the first transfers between individuals
;onveyed sons improved land, he compared the recited consideration
Ln a series of railroad sales starting in 1867 with that of noncailroad sales occurring in the same period and determined therefrom
;hat since the railroad sales had a weighted average consideration of
3k.26% less than the non-railroad sales, this percentage represented
an added consideration for improvements. By comparing the weighted
.verage consideration recited in 27 deeds conveying in excess of
-,OO0 acres each and averaging 3,362 acres in size with 1,077-deeds
”ec0rded.during the same period and averaging 229 acres in size, and
vn--king his findings against the fact that the amount listed in the
L900 census reports as the total.value of buildings on Omaha cession
-and equalled but 15% of the total value reported for both buildings
and real estate, Mr. Davis determined that large tracts brought an
average 42.39% less than smaller units.

‘With these percentages Mr. Davis reduced all recited considera;ions to a "bare land value" upon which he rested his final conclu:ion in part without respect to other factors contributing to the
.hesland market values at the time of these later sales and which
‘actors may or may not have been within.the knowledge or reasonable

.nticipation of a prospective purchaser in 1854.

6-Ind. Cl. Con. 730 r. , 755

If the consideration for sales averaging 3 ,3a2 acres in size

amounted to £«,2.39% less than that for units containing one-seventh

as much land, the use of the “bare land value" of the smaller units

to arrive by 1::a;hematical equation at a fair market “bare land

value” for a L,982,097-acre tract becomes quite impractical. In

any event, this procedure would result in assigning to the land in

l85h the increased values flowing 30:21 a heavier settlement, the
existence of a railroad, the presence of new roads, churches, schools,
an established system of government, the existence of law and order and
other developments occurring within Nebraska between l8 51+ and the various dates of these later sales. Obviously fair market value can not
be determined by such mathematical computation to the exclusion of
other factors.

Data concerning several sales of large tracts has been placed in
evidence. For such data to be beneficial in valuing another tract
there must be some reasonable relationship in time, location, size
and character of the tracts involved. The sales occurring between
1790 and 1866 in New England, the Great lakes States and in Georgia
as Well as the Cherokee Neutral land sale in Kansas which Mr. Davis
took into consideration in arriving at his valuation, have no elements of comparison except possibly that of size. ‘Two other large
sales are those oi‘ 9<}‘,996.3h acres'in Platte County and 99,973.08
acres in Stanton County, both counties contai ing Omaha cession land,
which the Midland Railroad Company sold to one Converse in l87l for

$l25,00O or $1.25 per acre in one instance and for $1,000 or but lc

;}-Tnd.Cl.Com. 730 755

“rer acre in the other. These are not included in the railroad sales
zsed by Mr. Davis in his computations. The largest of those sales

{as one of 5,943.97 acres. Hovrever the two Converse sales conveyed
aver 50% of all the railroad land sales. They occurred 16 years after
she appraisal date, have a weighted averaged consideration of 65¢ per
acre, involve part of the same territory, and are the nearest in point
of time to the appraisal date of any large sales except the Cherokee
‘Cansas land wi‘.-ich sold on credit for $1 per acre in 1868. 'I;he Converse
sales suggest that l7 years after the appraisal date that portion of
he Omaha cession which was removed from the trade centers along the
.~.issouri River was selling in unlimited Quantities upon the open market
in an unimproved state for an average of 65¢ per acre when not supportii’-... .,y the Government‘s minimum statutory price of $1.25 per acre,.and
vhen acreages of extraordinary size were involved.

What a prospective purchaser would willingly have paid f or the
Omaha cession land in l85L~, depended upon several factors. He would
have given consideration to the size of the tract, the incidental expense of surveying, advertising, managing and promoting a resale program, the carrying expense such as taxes and interest upon any financing required by him in the original ptmchase or required of him in its
subsequent resale. He woulri have considered.  hi:-;.:.e:st  teat use
of the land, the markets for its produce, the prevalent demand 
land and possirle period of resale. He could look back on a well
formulated pattern of settlement in the prairie states west of the

6—Ind.Cl.Com. 730   757

of a stream affording some timber but with prairie land attached; that
the distance from established settlements was material but more importa
ant still was the location with respect to water transportation and the
western overland traffic lande’; he would know the lure of western gold
which swept the emigrant trains past available public land in Missouri
and Iowa and on far to the west; He would consider the economic recession of 1853, that financing would cost him at least 8% interest; that
the railroad termizated east of the Mississippi River and could not be
expected to reach the Omaha cession fer several years; that passage of
the Graduation Act was imminent and would increase the competitive
value of the bulk oi‘ the unsold public domain in the east; that
1,360,000,000 acres of unsold public land was on the market as of

June 30, 1853, of which 22,700,000 acres were in~I-Iissouri and 22,800 ,000 acres in Iowa; that public land in Iowa was moving rapidly but that
-'=‘-PPr03<-‘'-P-a13el3* 2/.3 off.‘ the land in Iowa passing into private hands during
1852 was paid for izith iitary scrip which was selling on the stock
markets in the east at discounts as low as $1.08 per acre; that the
demand for Iowa land by both speculators and settlers had not yet
reached the extreme western portion of the state as is evident from

the fact that in the five Iowa counties of Pottawatomi, Harrison, I-'€;§,l.]_,s,
Ivionona and Plymouth bordering the Missouri River there had been only

89 land transfers mtween private parties in L853, conveying less the
100 acres per sale on an average, for a weighted average considerati
33-82 Der acre, art‘. that only 17 such sales occurred within those co=u;.l.,;t; I

ies during the whole of 1851;, although this land was considered slightf3..fy

preferable to the Cmaha tract and was only 9% disposed of. Such pu‘-r“:.ll;vl;;v_

.. have also acquainted himself with the vast amount of land in
‘eraska to which Indian title had been extinguished and which would
expected upon the public market within a reasonable time in comtition with the Omaha cession land.

Evidence concerning the rate of disposition of the Omaha cession
nd by the Government is not in the record, but the demand existing
2: it is shown by private sales made of it. In 1853, l85L,, and
55 there were 71 such sales, including sales of identical tracts,
L confined to Dodge, Douglas or Washington counties. Land in
zer counties bordering upon the Platte and Missouri rivers was
‘ad by individuals before 3.861, and in Cumings and Stanton counts such sales first occurred in 1861 and 1866, respectively.

T‘ an years after the appraisal date the first such sales were re*ded in Pierce and Wayne counties and two years later in Antelope
Lnty. Boone County had no such sales until 1872, eighteen years
.er the appraisal date. During 1871, 99,996.31; acres sold in _

.nton County for but one cent per acre. These transfers disclose

.t any demand for the Omaha cession land existing in 1851+ was con=.ed to the immediate vicinity of the Missouri and Platte rivers, along

traffic land s to the west. A prospective purchaser in 1851; Would

e discounted this demand as one resulting from the emigrant trade

hin that restricted area. We think the consideration for the early

es in this vicinity must be heavily discounted, both on account of

inflated currency in Nebraska Territory at the time and the small

951393 conveyed.

6-Ind.Cl. Com. 730 759

From all the evidence before us, and those items of which the
Commission takes judicial notice, we believe the record supports
a finding that the 4,982,097.87 acres here involved had a market

value of 75¢ per acre or $3,736,573.40 on April 17, 185A; that

the consideration paid of $975,739.54 was unconscionable, and that
petitioners are entitled to recover of the defendant the difference

of $2,760,833.$6 Zess such offsets as may hereafter be determined

to be due it.
