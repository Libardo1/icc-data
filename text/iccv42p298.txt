INTERLOCUTORY ORDER

UPON THE findings of fact numbered 9 through 21 and the opinion this
date entered herein, both of which are hereby made part of this order, the
Commission concludes as a matter of law that:

1. The fair market value on July 4, 1805, of Royce Areas 53 and 54,
Ohio, was $2,848,787.70, or $1.10 per acre

2. Consideration in the total amount of $32,666.65 under the Treaty
of Fort Industry, July 4, 1805, 7 Stat. 87, was paid to the respective
signatory tribes as follows: to the Wyandots, $8,333.33; to the Delawares,
$8,333.33; to the Chippewas, $6,133.33; to the Ottawas, $6,133.33; to the
Potawatomies, $3,733.33.

3. By reason of the disparity between the consideration paid for
such lands and the value thereof as determined by the Commission, the

consideration so paid and received was unconscionable.

4. The following amounts should be deducted as payments on the
claim: the Wyandot plaintiffs,$8,33333;the Delaware plaintiffs, $8,333.33;
the Chippewa plaintiffs, $6,133.33; the Ottawa plaintiffs, $6,133.33; the

Potawatomi plaintiffs and intervenors, $3,733.33.

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the respective plaintiffs and intervenors
herein are entitled to recover from the defendant the following net sums,
less such gratuitous offsets as defendant may be entitled under the provisions of the Indian Claims Commission Act: to the Wyandot plaintiffs,

$561,424.21; to the Delaware plaintiffs, $561,424.21; to the Chippewa
plaintiffs, $563,624.21; to the Ottawa plaintiffs, $563,624.21; to the

Potawatomi plaintiffs and intervenors, $566,024.21; and

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this case proceed to a determination of the
amount of any gratuitous offsets allowable.
