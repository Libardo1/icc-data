- 2 (1) For the value of 700,642 acres of land coded by the agreement
of September 26. 1872 (approved December 15. l8?h) beeed'mpon.an'unconccioneble consideration;

(2) For gold removed from the lands coded by the 1872 agreement
prior to the cession thereof to defendant; and.

(3) For thefamount of offsets erroneously adjudged against petitioner by the Court of Claims in Shoehone Tribe V. United Stetee, E0.

H-219. 82 6. C19; 23.

The above clearly shows that there are three separate and unrelated

transactions or occurrences, each of which is complete in iteolf and
could be pleaded without joining the other two. The purpose of the
rule is to facilitate a c1oer'proocntation of the matters involved. and
3 clear presentation requires the p1oe5ing to be in ouch shape that the
defendant's pleading may squarely meet the allegations eeperetely ac to
each cause of action pleaded.

It is our conclueion that the pleeding.in question doe? not comply
with the rule set forth above and that the notion of the defendant must

be euateined.

In the preparation of an amended petition it shall not be neceozary
to attech.copiee of the documents a,oended to the petition if they are

referred to by eooroprietc citations in the amended petition.
