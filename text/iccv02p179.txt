OPIANIOE

PER CURIAM. The claims involved in this proceeding are asserted

 -i in behalf of the Joseph Band of the Nez Perce Tribe; by the Confederated

Tribes of the Colville Resezrvation, sea. by Charles 3. Williams, et e1,

as the representatives of the Joseph  for alleged breaches by the

' ‘  respondent of its alleged fiduciary o'o1ig,-ations to the petitioners.

The respondent filed on Novesfoer 21, 1951, a motion to dismiss,

said motion being based on the contention of the respondent that none

of the claims asserted in the petition is-a claim.against the United
States “on behalf of any Indian tribe, band, or other identifiable

group of American Indians ," as contemplated and required by Section 2

of the Indian Claims Commission Act.

The petitioners, controverting_' the motion of respondent, alleges
that the claims being urged are those ‘of tthe Joseph Band of the Hez
Perce Tribe“; that said band is alleged to be "a tribe, band or identifiable group of Indians residing on the said Colville Reservation," and
that said Confederated Tribes of the icolville Reservation has authority
as the representative of thesaid Joseph. Band to assert the claims; or
if said tribes have not such authority, then the individual petitioners
as members of said Joseph Bend are authorized to bring the claims as

the representatives of all the members of saiddband.

’.

Petitioners allege that the respondentiwrbngfully has refused to
pay and has never paid to Joseph's“ '_or‘,'any_-oi‘ the members thereof,
its pro rata shareiin the trust funds and properties of the Nez Perce
Tribe”; also, that respondent "in’vi.olation of law and in breach of its
fiduciary obligations wrongfully has-refused to and has never made any
allotments of lands of the Nez Perce ‘Bribe to J’eseph‘s Band or any of

the members thereof."

As reason of suchalleged wrongful acts the petitioners pray “that
the respondent be required to render a  and complete accounting with
respect to trust properties alleged. to have been under its control,“

and that respondent be required to .=1pa.y to Joseph's Band such an amount

as is revealed by such an accounting to be due and unpaid, together

with interest.”

\

The respondent in support of its motion to dismiss contends that
the claims asserted are "on behalf of certain members of the tribe
rather than the tribe,‘ namely,‘ members who claim to be also members

of the Joseph Band."

The respondent urges insupport of its motion to dismiss that
the claims of the petitioners are based on the contention that the
individual members of Josephis Band; did not get their pro rata share of
the trust funds and properties of -the Nez Perce .Tribe and that they did not
get any individual allotments of lands of the Nez _Perce Tribe, and that
therefore the only recovery that could bethad, if any at all, would be by"
reason of wrongs suffered by the indiviidualmembers oflthe petitioner
band rather than a wrong stpuffvered  the Band as a Band. In the determination of the question here in_v_oLlved the allegations contained in

the petition must be considered as_'true. (See opinion of this Corzmission

in the Loyal Creek case , Docket No;  .

The petition alleges that Jospeph‘ sl  as atmember of the Nez
Perce Tribe had rights, interest and  in certain specified 7
properties   of the Fez Perce Tribe and that as to such interest as a band they have suffered wrongs at the hands of the respondent.’
As to whether or notpthese rights rested upon the individual cla:i..ns of
members in the Joseph'Band - as. the respondent infers as the purpose

of its motion, is a question that can only be determined after hearing

the evidence that may be introduced in support thereof. As stated
by the Court of Claims in its opinion in.the Indians of California

case (Indian Claims Commission, Docket No. 31) "for jurisdictional

ipurposes, which relate only to the authority to entertain the petition

and to hear and.determine claims, the merits and the nature of the

proof that will be required to establish the claims, are not involved."

.As the petition asserts a tribal claim and requests tribal relief,

respondent is not entitled to its motion for dismissal on the pleadings
alone. Also see McGhee, et al v. United States, 121 C. Cls. ,
decided May 6, 1952. In our opinion evidence is required in order that
the question of whether or not the claims asserted are tribal claims or
are individual claims to be determined. Therefore it follows that the
respondent's motion must be overruled; same to be without prejudice,
however, to the right of the respondent to urge the same defense upon

the trial of the case on its merits.
