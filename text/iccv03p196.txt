the Commission rendered an opinion together with additional findings

of iaotaiioeiag offsets and rendering final judgment for plaintiff.
Thereaiter, the attorneys representing the plaintiff took an appeal
to the Court of Claims and all three cases were carried to that Court
for a review of the findings and the decision of the Commission therein.

L,The said 'three_:_-cases were filed originally by Keenan Pepper. and
Felix Mccauley. as members of said Kain Tribe of Indians. under Sec. 10
of the Indian Claims Commission Act, alleging that said tribe had ceased
to maintain.a tribal organization. ._The Commissionwas later advised of
the death of Keenan Pappan and the claims were prosecuted thereafter
on the relation of Felix l.1cCa:u.ley alone,

Subsequent to the filing of the record on ‘said appeal\in the‘ Court
of Claims, one Arthur B. Honnoldg purporting to be the only duly authorized and approved attorney for the Kaw Tribe of Indians, filed in that I
Court a motion for leave to intervene and to file a motion to dismiss
the qapeali The interven@ motion to dismiss the appeal. which accompanied the motion for leave to file, was signed on behalf‘ of the
“Kansas or Kaw Tribe of Indians” by Joseph L. Cross. who styled himself
as “the duly elected, qualified’ and acting chairman of the Council of
the Kansas or Kaw Tribe of Indians." said intervening motion to dismiss
being also signed by Arthur B. Eonnold, as the “authorized and approved
attorney for the Kansas or Kaw Tribe of Indians.“

‘T The Court of Claims in remanding the case to this Commission states:
The: record shows that a contract entered into between a
Committee of Ken‘ Indians and Arthur B. Eonnold, attomey, and
a contract entered _into by Felix Mccauley, and others, on be‘ 7:5’

of the Kan Tribe. with Dennis Bushyhead, attorney were both
approved by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. '

‘.-‘?hepCourt of Claims had then before it the question of whether or not

to consider the appeal that had been brought to review the findings
and decision of the Commission; or topermit the motion presented by

attorney Honnoldoto intervene and file a motion to dismiss the appeal.
With reference to said. question the Court, in its opinion remanding,

said this: ' I

he dopnot deem itnecessary to discuss and pass upon

the various contentions made by the Cross and Honnold group
in their motion for leave to intervene and to dismiss the

appeal. and the contentions and arguments advanced by the
appellant Liccanley and the Bearn Group of attorneys under

the Bushyhead contract -in opposition to the intervening
motion to dismiss, for the reason that in our opinion the

question of which group of Indians is entitled to represent‘
said tribe is one which should be decided, in the first

instance. by the Indian Claims Commission.

The Court made the further comment, to-wit:'

*" "' ‘ Apparently. the Indian Claims Commission recognised
Felix Mccauley _as_the proper representative of the Eat: Tribe
of Indians. and the Eearn Group of attorneys under the

Dennis Bushyhead contract as the proper group of attorneys to
represent the tribe and, on the record here. we are inclined

to the view that the Commission's position was the correct
one. But the Commission made no findings, entered no opinion,

and made no order or decision specifically with reference to
this matter. s

The Court further held that the‘ Indian Claims Commission clearly
had jurisdiction to determine the question of representation as involved in the Eonnold motion to intervene. and it was remanded to this
Commission for its consideration and decision and theentry of such
findings and opinion as this Commission should deem warranted.

Therefore, it is the opinion of this Commission that under‘ the

opinion remanding the case to this Commission, the sole qdestion now

before this Comission is the determination of which group of Indians

tribe , and which group of attorneys  a contract approved by the
Commissioner oi"In'd_ian Affairs is entitled to represent said tribe .

We will hereafter refer to the parties to the controversy herein

as the Eearn. Group and the Honnold Group . Although the Honnold Group

in the original _pe_tition._i11 Docket 38 ‘before this Commission brought

the claims asserted in -Dockets 33, 31%,‘and 35. and that the Eonnold
Group had been authorized as a recognized tribal organization and
tribal selected attorneys to represent said tribe in the matters in--,

volved in said Docketf numbers-,_ and that therefore the Hearn Group had.

no authority to prosecute said claims. _

In view iof"tourT'{d‘ecis’i.on-t and findings of fact in determining; the

issues now before us... it becomes unnecessary to make a finding as to

whether or not thefevipdetnce net beforeus establishes that the Eat:
Tribe had such tribal I’ organization as contended for by_ the Eonnold
Group, and this because’ we find that if such tribal organization
existed it had lost its erclusive privilege of representing the tribe

by reason of its failure to properly represent ‘the interests of said

tribe.
Prior to the filing of Dockets 33. 31: and 35 and Docket 38, to

which more reference will be made_l_ater; attorney Arthur B. Honnold
had filed efpetitionpiith the Indian Claims Commission on behalf of
the Pawnee Tribe oi; lndians (Docket Eo.__lO) wherein a claim was t
asserted in behali‘ of said. tribe of; Indians based on their alleged
one-time ownership of a'' body of land. a part of which was
located within the ggsséeeeeé state er Kansas andrest er the Big Blue
and Smoky Bill Biverpszp and the eastern boundary of that part of said

At the time the petitionin the Pawnee case wasgfiled, attorney
Honnoldi icnew that the Ear {tribe of Indians had asserted ownership to
lands located in_the present State of Kansas west"of the Big Blue and
Smoky Hill Rivers because by Treaty of June 3, 1825, (7 Stat. 270) a
reservation had been created for thense and occupancy of the Kaw
Indians containing approximately 6,500,000 acres. and that approximately
5, 500,000 acres of said resert"ation;_lay west of the Big Blue River and
in the present State of Kansas; he knew of the conflicting -claims between the Pa.'§'{I}.eeS and the Rams as to lands in Kansas lying west of the
Blue and Smoky Rivers because prior to his making a. contract with the
Kaws to represent them, he haddiscussed with members of the Kat: Tribe
the fact of said conflicting claims and that he was interested in
getting an agreement between the Fawnees and the -Kat-rs as to a common

boundary.

In conference with the so-called Council of the Kate said controversy as to‘ the boundary between the two tribes was discussed and Honnold

stated that he could not accept employment to represent the Kaws, as was
mentioned by some members of the Council present, without the consent of
the Pawnee Tribe.
to represent the Kaws and the contract with the laws was thereafter
entered into without any agreement having been effected as to what would
be the comon boundary between the two tribes, and without any agreement
-on the part of said Eonnold to waive the claims he had already filed in’
behalf of the ‘Pawnee Tribe to lands that had theretofore been claimed by
the Kane and which subsequent development showed. they had the better

claim i thereto .

Thereafter Eonnold got the consent of the Pawnee Tribe

with the western boundary line being the eastern boundary

There is no controver between the Kaws and the IE-‘awnees

as we have previously stated were found by this Commission ‘in Docket
33 to belong to the Kaws), argument after argument was made, as set

Dennis Bdshyhead, an attorney, to prosecute the Ear: claims,’ nnder which
contract Dockets Hos. 33,; 31+. and 35 were file‘d.l The Connissioner of
Indian Affairs approved the contract entered. into with attomey Honnold
and also the contract entered into with attorney Bnshyhead. The findings of fact gnade herein set out the reasons given by the Commissioner
of Indian Aifairsfor his approval of both contracts.

As. hereinbefore stated, the hearings. and introduction of evidence
in.Docket No. 10 inunbehalf of the Pawnees before the Indian Claims
Comission began in_-.Ji.anna.ry, 19148, and were concluded in April. 19149.
Dockets 33, 31+, 35 and 38% in behalf of the Kaws were set for trial for
September .19. 19504 at the_ti1ne of the setting for trial ofthe claims
of the said Kaw Indians, this commission being aware of the conflicts
between the said Pasrnees and the Xaws as to lands claimed in Kansas
west of the Blne_and Smoky Rivers, as evidenced  the claim asserted‘
in Docket 33, andthe evidence introduced in Docket 10 in behalf of the
Pas-znees and the claim therein made by said tribe and its attorney

Eonnold for lands that were claimed by the Kaws in Docket 33 by the

petitioners therein and the attorneys filing said docket number, which

said claim was not being made 3- the claimants and attorney ‘Eonnold in

Docket S — this‘ Conmission concluded-that ‘it should recognize the

petitioners in Dockets 33. 31; and 35 and the attorneys in said docket

numbers so that the Kaw Indians would get presented the claim asserted

it was the opinion of this Comission that the Honnold petitioners. and

the proper representative of the Kate’ Tribe of Indians and the Eearn Group
of attorneys under the Dennis Bushyhead contract were the proper attorneys 3
to represent the tribe. Hence, this Commission struck from the trial
docket Docket 38 and proceeded with the trial of Dockets 33, 31+ and 35

at that time. I

The record will lshownthatnthe said Honnold was in attendance upon
the hearing on September 19, 19149, and that neither he nor the petioners in Docket 38,’ or anrone representingthem, ‘made any protest
to the striking of Docket 38 from the trial docket of the Comission
or the action__ of said Commission in proceeding with the trial of
Dockets 33, 311- and 35. '

On September 17, 1931; awards were made by. the Ir__1dian‘Claims- Commission in fairor of the Kaw Tribe of Indians in Dockets 33 and 35, and
on November 21. 1951. aidociment was filed under said docket numbers

Honnold file in Docket 38 in behalf of the Ea:-rs. This Commission found

-that these lands had been owned by the Karts and not by the Pawnees
and an awardpwas made -inusaid Docket 33 in behalf of the Kerr Tribe
in the amount of $1,823,616. It is obvious from the record referred
to in this opinion and the findings of fact we make in support of
same, that a recovery for this land ras ‘not sought in behalf of the
Kaws by said Honnold, and he could not have introduced evidence in
stgport of the same and been true to his Pawnee client, and an award
therefor to the Kaws would not have been made had Docket No. 38 and
the petitioners therein. and the attorneys therein, been recognized
as the exclusive representatives of the Eat: Tribe. °

In addition to the gmunds as hereinabove urged as reasonsfor the
recognition -of the right of the Bears. Group to represent the Kaw Tribe
in the proceedings herein involvfegi,‘ the fact that the Honnold Grow _
was represented by Mr. Eonnold himself in person at the time the Indian
Claims Comission in official session struck Docket 38 from the trial
docket and proceeded to trial of Dockets 33, 33+ and 35, and made no
protest as to the trial of said dock-ets by the Hearn Group of attorneys,
‘permitted said Docket mmbers to proceed to trial and to the 'con-clusion of said trials, and to a judgent in behalf of the Kaw Indians
as a result thereof, constituted such acquiescence in said proceedings
as in the judgment of this Comission would preclude the Honnold Group
now at this time from asserting that said docket numbers were prosecuted by the Beam Group without authority or right; and if such conduct

did not have that result, certainly the filing by the Eonnold Group on

Hovenber 2.1, 1951, in Dockets 33 and 35 of the document headed

For the reasons herein set forth. and the findings of fact herein

made, this Commission was of_the opinion and is now of the opinion
o that Felix Mccanley and associates. and the Hearn Group of attorneys
under Dennis Bushyhead contract were, and are, entitled to represent
and prosecute the claims asserted in Dockets Nos. 33, 31%, and 35 on

the opinion, that Joseph L. Cross and others constituting the so-called

Council of the Kansas or Kaw Tribe of Indians, and the said Eonnold and

T‘ \

attorneys associated with him. were guilty of laches and were not
properly prosecuting all the claims of the ‘Ear: Tribe of Indians -- and
regardless of whether said Kgw Tribe had a tribal organization recognized as hating authority to represent it, the facts as herein delineated show that said Honnold Group as plaintiffs and attorneys were

not the proper group to represent said tribe in the claims herein

doubtful, v at least it" has been questioned, but as I view the matter it
is immaterial whether the employment of Bushyheadevrast the result of a
“general meeting“ oi‘ the tribe ornot, for it is certain that a group
of the Kaw Indians anthorized the employment of Bushyhead to present
the claims of the Ear Tribe to the Indian Claims ‘Commissions It is
equally certain   the sole efforts of Hccanley and Bushyhead
and hisassociated attorneys. a substantial award. $2,398,220.02, was
obtained for the  Tribe; (Final order of Kay 15, 1952). Thatliccauley
had the right under section 10 of the Indian Claims Commission Act (25
U. S. C. .!L.'{0 i) to assert ‘and prosecute the claims of the Kaw cannot be
denied. d F I I

Liccauley, not being satisfied with the award we made; appealed. as
he had the right to do, to the Court of Claims. ‘

On February 2, 1953, and after the appeal was perfected, a motion
for leave to intervene and to file motion to dismiss the appeals was
filed in the Court of Claims accompanied by a motion to dismiss the
appeals mentioned above.’ Ehe motion to intervene was made by "Kansas
or Kaw Tribe of Indians, by Arthur B.'Honnold, its duly anthorized and
approved Attorney of Becor_d.”l‘ The motion to dismiss was in the name
of the same tribe Joseph L. Cross, chairman of the Tribd. Council.“

Mccauley opposes these motions in said court.

It may here be ‘stated that .£.::th'u.r 3.. Eonnold also had an attorney's
contract (Eonnold Ex.‘ 5), dated dannary 30, 1948, executed by himself

the tribe. A ,. - --_j--_

I

There is only one judgment and that is for the Kaw Tribe, with all
members of that tribe beneficiaries. It cannot be said that all the
members of the ‘Kan Tribe belong to the two contestig groups, so the

importance to the courtof determining whether either of the two groups
represents the tribe‘ is ‘obvious.
,In my opinion the Commission has not met this requirement. This
is its ultimate  (22)-;
We find that Felix 1.-Iccanley is theuproper representative of
the Kansas or Kan Tribe oi‘ Indians entitled to prosecute the
claims here involved on_-behalf of said Tribe, an that the Eearn

Group of attorneys under the Bushyhead contract is entitled to

represent the Tribe in the prosecution of the claims asserted in
itsbehalf in Dockets_Nos. 33, 314 and 35. .

Taken literally, this finding simply says that iicdauley  his counsel
were entitled to prosecute the claims of thetribe and, although the
language is somewhat enigatic, I would think the taking of an appeal
mould be par}: of such representation. I agree that éiccanley and his
counsel were representing that tribe before this Commission and in talcing the appeal. ‘About this there can be no doubt in my opinion. But
the Court of Claims is confronted with motions purporting to_be made
by the judgent creditor, the Ear Tribe, seeking permission to file a
motion to dismiss‘ the appeals to that court, so the court isiaslring us
to .decide whether the motions are in reality those of the Ear Tribe.
Obviously, only the Kawf {would have the right to present such motions.

I do not thinkuthe Commission’s finding has met the court's order
to determine “which group of Indians is entitled to represent the tribe”

\

in considering the motions and since the Commission has made no order

on the finding the court must loo}: to the finding only for its answer.

If the court should accept the finding as determining tmt the
motions are not those of the Kaw Tribe, then I say the commissionls
finding is contrary to the undisputed evidence in the record on the
motions. evidence. by the way, which is completely ignored by the Commission in its findings of fact and opinion. I shall now consider
that evi 5.e’nee.i I

As shown above, the final award of the Commission was made on
May 15, 1952. On September 17,1952, a meeting of the *'£‘ri"oal Council
and Business Committeebf Kansas or K83? Efribe of Indians" was held at
Xa'.v'Cit' , Oklahoma, - According to the minutes of the meeting "a quorum
and other representative members of the tribe" were present. (7.-Ionnold
.'-ix. 8). At that meeting the tribal council passed a resolution adopting the judgment and directing attorney Arthur I3. Eonnold to tae
steps to dismiss the appealsfrom the judgment.

on 1'-'ebr-.zary 2, 1953; filed the motions in the Cov:_rt of Claims.

Following the filing or the motions to intervene and dismiss a

general meeting of the members of the Ear ‘Bribe was held pursuant to

 

posted and published notices of the meeting to be held at Washinga.
Oierla... on Key 19. 1953 (the year is not stated in the notices but there
seems to be no complaint about -that or showing that any member of the
tribe was misled by the omission). and according to the dnmtes of the
meeting (Eonnold ‘Jr. 12), 109 members of the tribe were present and
eighty-four voted. The stated purpose of the meeting was to -“determine

in movingfor the dismissal of the unauthorized appeals, or * * approve

the taking of the appeals with the resulting risk and delay in receiving the money awarded.” (Bonnold-Ex. 12).

’ As to the tribal status of the Kaw, it was stated on December 12,

1952 (Hearn Ex. 1) by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who should

know. as fo1lov:s:Our records indicate that the Kama Tribe has no’ formal
tribal governmental organization. The tribal members elected
a business committee which is not active. Whenever an expression of the Kass Tribe is needed, it is necessary to hold a
general meeting of the adult tribal members. The records
reveal no information concerning the position of a tribalchief in the present-day affairs of the Eat: Tribe. ‘

The Oomissioner was misinformed when he wrote that the_Bu.siness Com-;
mittee was inactive, for W. ‘.7. Head, area director of the Indian Service,

testified on September 17, 1953, (Trans. p. 37). that there was an active

business council on_ October 7, 19148, and following. Moreover, the un' disputed evidence shows meetings of the council held October ‘I, 1937,»

October 16-17, 19118, I.-{arch 3, l91k'$. and September 17, 1952. Also, the
evidence conclusively shows that a ne.w_conncil.was elected at a general
meeting of the Kan’ Indians held on October 7, 191:8. (See Eonnold Ens.
2, 3, 5, _8__and 1%, 14-2., respectively).

Referring again to the minutes of the general meetg of the tribe
(Honnold Ex. 12), it appears the Indians discussed the issue of dismissing
the appeals or continuing with the litigation and decided the issue very

definitely by passing this resolution:

"BE IT RESOLVED, that it is the desire of the Kansas or Raw
Tribe of Indians, officially determined by this general meeting of the members of the Kansas or Raw Tribe of Indians, that
the tribe accept the awards rendered it in the total sum of
$2,398,220.02 in satisfaction of its claims against the United
States, and that the appeals now pending in the Court of Claims
(Appeals Nos. 7-52,8-52, and 9-52) be dismissed.

"BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the action of the tribal officials
and business committee in directing Arthur B. Honnold, attorney
for the tribe, and his associates, Wheeler & Wheeler, in moving

for dismissal of the appeals, be and it is hereby approved and
ratified. I

"BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the wishes and desires of the
members of the tribe be made known to the Court of Claims."

At this meeting 84 voted for the resolution and 12 absent members expressed

their approval of the award and desire of dismissing the appeals. (Honnold

Ex. 12). No member voted against the resolution.

Thus, it will be seen, the tribe acted in the only way it could act,
first, through its elected business committee, and secondly, through a
general meeting of the members of the tribe, when it directed its attorney
to take action on behalf of the tribe for the dismissal of the appeals.
Furthermore, the procedure followed was that accepted by the Government
in its dealings with the Raw. As I look at the undisputed evidence in
this record I think it is conclusively to the effect that the motions now

before the Court of Claims are those of the Raw Tribe, and a finding and

an order to that effect should have been made.

It is argued that only the Raw Tribe could employ counsel to prosecute its claims and for that purpose it employed Honnold. I consider the

contention unimportant here because it is quite plain that the officials
of the tribe sat back and without objection permitted Mccauley and his

counsel to prosecute the tribal claims, and it was not until the

interlocutory order was entered that they - the tribal officials - ‘became
active. and; then only for theodevious ‘out clear purpose of obtaining for
Eonnold a Share of the attorneys‘ fee that may ‘be allowed LicCauley‘s

counsel. (See ratification of award. approval of attorneys‘ fees etc.,
Finding No. 11%). It is true a claim was presented on ‘behalf of the tribe
after theliccanley petitions were filed birth the tri"oal officials seemed
satisfied to allow Hccauley to continue the work and, through no apparent
efforts of theirs, obtain a large award for the Kaw tribe. Be this as it
may. it was with tribal approval or ratification at a meeting regularly
called under the direction of -a Government officer, the District Agent,
that the motions were filed for and ‘on behalf of the Ear Tribe, and not
the Cross group. i to \
