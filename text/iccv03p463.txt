the decision of the Court of Claims reversing the decision of the Indian
Claims Commission in denying said -intervention.

subsequent to said decision of the court of claims, on the 21st day

‘of December, 1953. this Commission-entered an order allowing the intervention of the said Creek Ration East of the Mississippi. said order pro?
viding. however. that all the evidence theretofore introduced;should be
considered as evidence  the further trial of said Docket 21; and on said
date this Comission also ‘ordered that said cause be reopened for such

further evidence as the defendant and the intervenor might desire to offer

_in said cause.

Thereafter further evidence was "introduced and the intervenor introduced the Treaty of Ghent enteredtinto between Great Britain and the ‘United
States. being the treaty ending what was called the War of 1:812 between the
United States and Great Britain, endasserted that Article II of said i
treaty required the United States to return to the Creek Nation the_1ands
that had been cededto‘ the mited States by said Eation by the Treaty of

Ft._Jackson entered into between ‘the Ihited States and the Creek Nation.

_ Thistreatyihad not been urged. by the plaintiff as a basis of liability of

the defendant and the contention of. the Iintervenor based on said treaty is
the principal new issue and new question raised by said intervention.

The determination of whether or not the Treaty. of Ghent creates liability of the defendant as asserted by the intervenor depends upon the

construction of Article 3 of said treaty. and whether or not same is

available to the plaintiff.

The defendant contends that the intervenor by raising the issue of

liability of the defendant to the plaintiff under Article Ix of the Treaty

In

 e';'“-_—s»‘- '3-,_ Intervenor contends that the paragraph quoted does not restrict its .

  .3;  evidence under the order of the Commission permitting the intervention;
   that the ultimate issue isgthe liability of the defendant for the value of
  the land ceded by the meaty of Ft. Jackson and that the assertion by it

 '-_§-'f_"_::::..: of; liability by reason of Article IX of the Treaty of Ghent is merely
’ “:5. urging an additional basis for liability -- that the ultimate issue‘ is
I not changed.

   ' Even if the issue made by the intervenor is a new issue it would seem

  that it probably has the right to assert the -‘same because it was filed on
 April 1!», 1951. prior to the limitation date of the filing of claims.
T‘ Another reason  this Commission thinks the intervenor has a right to

urge said basis oi‘ liability, if it be one, is because of the liberal

 constrnction that should be given in these Indian cases to the assertion

  H of rights on the part of the Indians and of pleadings on their part. Even
  though we be in error in granting the right to urge said treaty as a
.. ~' -I‘

 

- ._-'  basis of liability, our holding with reference to same, as it will here  after appeal’. makes said error (if any) of no effect.
 =§$’:i3
1;; In construing the Treaty of Ghent under Article IX thereof and the
   7 
 terms and intent of the parties thereto, it is conceded by both parties
  that recourse may be had to its history, ‘including the negotiations
  therefor, the diplomatic correspondence of contracting parties,*the
 -'--‘-...“-".-_‘*"1 '
'—'-.'°_;  ‘ .
 .:f_‘L;'-E___- official acts ‘of the Government or its officials in interpreting the same,
  

 etc. (Int. Orig. 'Brf., p. 203; Def. '.Brf.,‘ p.*_-'57).
 Article IX of_-the Treaty of Ghent-provides in part as follows:
-   ‘The United States of America engage to put an end,
’4~ E_ _.;::.i—;.E'.:-_l;:'; immediately after the ratification of the ‘present treaty,

 5::-J? to hostilities with all the tribes or nations of Indians
ft‘-i  with whom they  be at war at the time of such ratifi  cations; and forthwith-to restore to such tribes or nations,

‘.4   respectively, all the possessions, rights and privileges ‘

'  __ _l_‘.-’.‘-;‘;;  which they may have enjoyed or been entitled to in one thousand

—_ '  :3 eight hundred and eleven, previous to such hostilities: Pro- ‘ :2-f."  vided always, That such tribes or nations shall agree to desist

.-   from all hostilities against the United States of America, their

. ' ‘Z1,-._:;},:?;g citizens and subjects, upon the ratification of the present

 t-_ '...f._::-§-7 treaty being notified to such tribes or nations, and shall so

5'-"  desist accordingly.“

  The Treaty of Ghent was concluded on December 211-, l8_l_1+, and ratifi _-'-   cations of same by the respective nations involved were exchanged on
 5  February 17', 1815. and it was proclaimed by the President on February 18,
    1815. "The treaty provides that it shall become effective and bind.ing

 .'  when these ratifications have been exchanged.

  ‘lbs so-called Treaty of ‘Ft. Jackson was concluded on August 9, 1811!»,

   and was proclaimed on February l6,_ 1815.

  (Ehe eighth Article of the Treaty of Ft. Jackson provides that peace
  shall ensue between the Creek Nation and the United States from its
  date.

The last egression of the American Commissioners to the British
Commissioners with reference to the provisions of the Treaty of Ghent
(later concluded) as to the provisions therein made with reference to

Indianswas contained in a letter dated October 13, 18114, which reads

as follows:
‘The article proposed by the British Plenipotentiaries,

in their last note, not including the Indian tribes as parties

in the Peace, and leaving the United States free to effect its
object in the mode consonant with the relations which they have
constantly maintained with those tribes. partxing also of the
nature of an amnesty, and being at the same time reciprocal, is
not liable tothat objection; and accords with the views uniformly
professed by the undersigned, of placing those tribes precisely,
and in every respect, in the same situation as that in which they
stood before the comencement of hostilities. This article, thus
proposing only what the undersigned have so often assured the
British Plenipotentiaries would necessarily follow, if, indeed,

it has not already. as_ is highly probable, preceded, a peace
between Great Britain and the United States, the undersigned “agree
to admit it in substance as a provisional article, subject in the

manner originally proposed by the British Government, to the appro- .

bation or rejection of the Government of the United States, which,

having given no instructions to the undersigned on this point,

cannot be --bound by any article they may admit on the subject.“

The receipt of this statement is aclmowledged by the British Com?missioners in letter dated October 2., 181’-L, such letter of acknowledgent
using this language:

“line undersigned have had. the honor of receiving the note of

the American Plenipotentiaries of the 13th instant, commicating their acceptance of the article which the undersigned

had proposed on the subject of the pacification and rights of

the Indian nations.‘

No further mention in said letter of said British Commissioners is
made as to the article of the Treaty dealing with the Indians.

The negotiations preliminary to the execution of the Treaty of
Ghent disclosed definitely that the British attempted to include the

Indians as parties to said treaty as to which they did not succeed, and

that it was agreed that under Article IX the United States was “free to

effect its object in the mode consonant with the relations they have
constantly maintained with these tribes. partaking also of the nature
of an amnesty, and being at the same time reciproca.l“j(Deft‘s. Bri'.,

p. 58); and the interpretation which the United States placed on said
Article IX of the treaty is clearly revealed by what the Goverment did

following treaty ratification. In; the instructions given to Generals

Harrison and Mcdrthur. Mr. John Graham, the Secretary of War advised them:

-_ "whenpthe treaty with Great Britain was ratified at
Washington, the United States were at war with some of the
Indian tribes, and at peace with. others. By the ninth
article of the treaty the parties reciprocally engaged to

. put an end to hostilities with all the tribes or nations
with whom they were respectively at war; "' "‘ "' But the.
United States wereat that time in a state of peace and
friendship with the tribes inhabiting the State of Ohio
and the = Territories of Michigan and Indiana; and had.‘ in B

articular. concluded a treaty at Greenville. on the 22d
July; 1815, with the Wyandots, Delawares, Shasvnees. Senecas,
and 1.-Iiamies." "‘ * "' Underscoring supplied .

As aresult of these instructions the United States negotiated and

 

concluded twenty-one treaties of peace with the Indians of the Mississippi
and the Northwest. (Intervenors have set these. different treaties out at
greatlength in their proposed findings and have- summarized in their Brief,

pp» 209-213).

no commissioners were appointed to treat with the Greeks and the

 reason is obvious; it was thought that the ninth article of the treaty did
 not apply to. that tribe. (Secretary Dallas wrote this to Judge Harrison
 on June 9, 1815).

 That this conclusion is correct is substantiated by the contempo raneous statements of American Governmental officials. On July 10, 1815-.»

-Subsequent to the ratification of said treaty, and on May 8, 1815,

(Deft's. Brf., pp. 1h, 15,

Anthony St. John Baker, British charge de affaires in Washington, wrote
Viscount Castlereagh of England that he had received from James Monroe,
Secretary of State of _the thited States, a communication to the effect
thatthe United States had taken measures looking to the pacification of
the northern Indians but that the United States conceived that it had
prior to theexecution ‘of the Treaty of Ghentfalready made peace with
the Creeks by the Treaty of Ft. Jackson. That this was the view of the
Isecretary of State at the time is further confirmed by letter of July 10,
1815, of ames lionroe to Anthony St. John Baker in which he stated among
other things too following: I
“"' * "' that as the Treaty with the Creeks was concluded

before the Treaty of Peace with Great Britain, the 9th article

of that Treaty has no bearing with that nation, "'_* "K."

At no time has the Government of the United States conceded that
Article IX of the Treaty required a return to the Creek Nation of the
lands ceded by the Treaty of Ft. Jackson, but on the contrary has main- _

tained the position that the Treaty of Ft. Jackson having been concluded

prior to the conclusion of the Treaty of Ghent, was a conclusion of peace

Creeks as being entitled to benefits under Article IX were made while
said Creeks were in Florida and were associated with the Seminoles at
the time who were then directed by English officers and provided with
arms and ammunition by the Spanish and English. (See Int. Reg. Fdgs.,
pp. 125-151%, inc.) They certainly were not any more of a separate organizationtotia-P9~ble of making a treaty than they were at the time of the execution of the Treaty of Ft. Jackson, at which time Intervenor asked a

finding that they were not_ such an entity as was capable of making a

treaty or authorized to cede laud. (Id. p. 1911-) .

Even if the Treaty of Ghent required a return to the Indians of the

lands ceded by the Treaty of Ft. Jackson, which we think it was not intended to do, we are of the opinion that such requirement ‘is subject to
abrogation by the United States without creating-‘any legal liability.
The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that Congress is ‘authorized to

modify provisions of previously executed treaties. The latest decision

found dealing with this question is that of Moser v. United States, 3341

U. s. 1u. While it is held by this decision that the act of the Government complained of as not being in keeping with a treaty was not directly

an issue —- (the Court being of the opinion that the statute involved was
not inconsistent with the treaty it was alleged to contravene) -- the Court

in discussing the question made this statement:

"Hot doubting that a treatymay be modified by a
_ subseouent act of Congress, it is not necessary to invoke such authority here, for we find in this congressionally imposed limitation on citizenship nothing
inconsistent with the mrposes and subject matter of
the treaty.“ (Underscoring supplied).

 

The following cases are cited as authority for Congress to modify a

previously executed treaty:

  While no act of Congress has been cited which directly interprets
 or modifies the Qient Treaty, the language of the Commissioners negoti ating the Treaty, the refusal of the United States Government after
 execution to construe the same as including the Greeks, and the con,;;~,_._  tinned recogni tion by the United states of the asset-siiip of the lands
 ceded by the Treaty of Ft. Jackson, and the disposition of said lands
‘-   under act of Congress as public lands (Act of Congress of March 3, 1815,
   (3 Stat. 228) provides for survey and disposition as public lands of the
 lands ceded by the Ft. Jackson Treaty) and the issuance of patents to
"9  _‘_1_  individual purchasers thereof, would seem to be as effective as would an
   affirmative congressional act denying the application of Article IX of
  - ‘..-  S
  the Treaty of Ghent to the Creek Nation, or any portion thereof.
  The defendant submits as its Finding No. 11; a statement that this
 United States consistently took the position that since the Treaty of
-5  Peace with the Greeks was entered into before the Treaty of Ghent, the
 :,  9th Article of that treaty had no bearing on the relations with that i
K ii-H":-__-E‘  Ration." The intervenor makes no objection to this finding "if it

 relates only to the Creek Nation as it existed on August 9, 1811!-.“

 It is undisputed that the Creek Nation was the same at the time of

the execution of the Treaty’ of Ghent as it was at the time of the execution of the Treaty of Jackson. What the intervenors are actually

Q

 claiming is that although the Creek Nation was not at war wi th the

‘United States on February 17, l8l5 (at the time of the execution of the

Treaty of Ghent), and although the Creek Nation was the owner of the land

  
 

-~'
*‘

ggidiceded by the Treaty of Jackson, nevertheless the United States is obligated

..’
3-.

J‘ '‘hgh to restore the land to the Creek Nation because some of the constituent
groups or hands of said Nation continued hostile and were, in the viewpoint
of the intervenor, "at war” with the United States on the date of the
Treaty of Ghent.

ifi Even if such groups or bands were at war (however, the hostilities

pp in evidence betweengsuch bands and groups and the United States which

continued after the Treaty of Ghent were more in the nature of sporadic

 

depredations and skirmishes as might be engaged in by guerrillas and not

under the usual definition of a "war"), there certainly was no continu.‘ __.__:£.. .r.:’__§_-.,._.:n‘.“-_' 3.1"‘;  '; 3'‘ .

ation of the hostilities that the Treaty of Jackson terminated. More
detailed discussion of the hostilities subsequent to the Treaty of Ghent
15 f0und in a later section hereof.

From the statements made by the American Secretaries of State in
regard to the application of Article IX of the Treaty of Ghent, and
other contemporaneous expressions and actions of our Government in making
treaties of peace with tribes whom they considered covered by Article IX,
it cannot be doubted that the executive interpretations of the Treaty of
Ghent were that Article IX was considered inapplicable to the Greeks.

The construction given by the Executive Department of the Government as
to the meaning of treaties is generally recognized as determinative of
their meaning as far as municipal law and the Courts are concerned is
unquestioned. (63 C. J_ Sec, 20; U. S. vs, Payne, 8 Fed. 883, 892; San
Lorenzo; etc, vs, Caples, #8 S. W. 2d 329 (Texas); Sullivan vs. Kidd,
251: U. s. LL33; 121+ U. s., 253)..

I Without doubt the said Article IX of the Treaty of Ghent was

inserted therein by the British in order to protect Indians, who had been
allies of the British in the War of 1812 against the United States, from
being punished or made to suffer loss by the United States for being
allies of the Britishi In the negotiations which resulted in the exe~
cution of the Treaty of Ghent, and in a communication of July 28, 181K,
Lord Castlereagh wrote to the British Commissioners that in their approaching discussions they should see to “the protection which the Indians,
as allies, are entitled to claim at our hands," (Def. Ex. 68, p. 68). A
protocol of conference between British and American Commissioners of

August 3, 181M, showed as a subject of discussion "that the peace be ex;

tended to the Indian allies of Great Britain," (Into Ex. 56, p. 1585).
Other references in said discussions referred to the intention of the
British Go?ernment in said peace to take care of the Indians "who have
8CtCd with then as allies during the war." (Int. Ex. 58, p, 87; Defo Ex.
67, p. 19M), In letter of Henry Golbourn, one of the British Commission—
ers at Ghent, dated August 21, 181“ to Lord Bathurst, with reference to
the provisions of the treaty being negotiated and as to the provisions
with reference to the Indian allies of the British, he stated that it

was of “very great importance” that he acquaint the American Commission»
ers "that Great Britain does not prohibit their acquisition of territory
by conquesta” (Def. Ex, 67, pp. 188, 189).

That the United States recognized that Article IX of the treaty
applied only to Indians who were allies of the British in the War of
1812, and that as to these Indians it desired to comply with the pro»
visions of said Article, is evidenced by the langueee used in treaties

{.3

executed between it and the Indian allies of the British in said war.

._For instance, the treaty with the Teton of July 19, 1815, in its preamble

says:

"The parties being desirous of re-establishing peace
and friendship between the United States and the said tribe,
and of being placed in all things, and in every respect, on
the same footing upon which they stood before the late war
between the United States and Great Britain, have agreed "' "‘ "'.“.

The same language appears in the preamble to the -treaty with the Sioux

of July 19, 1815 (II Kapp. 113); and the same language in the treaty

and with the Kickapoo (II‘Kapp. 115), and with the Wyandot, et 3.1,

language indicating that same were based on the fact of the Indians
having been allies of Great Britain in the War of 1812 and by reason
of the ending of that war.  
The facts as set out in our decision of April 22, 1952, and the
findings of fact upon which said decision was based, all of which are
reaffirmed by this decision, except as modified, show that the hostilities resulting in thevtreaty of Ft. Jackson were not a prt of the
War of 1812 with Great Britain but were activities of hostiles engaged

in a civil @ between different factions of the Creek Nation against

each other; in which warthe United. States came to the aid of the faction
engaged in said internecine warfare that was friendly to it, and which
faction would have been overcome by the so-called hostiles among the Creeks
who were fighting their brothers and the whites; that said hostiles were
not fighting in said so-called Creek War as allies of the British but
solely against their tribal brothers who were friendly to the United States.
Such association as occurred during said. Greek War between said Creek
hostiles and the British was that of assistance of the British (with Spanish
help) to the said hostiles in their warfare against their Creek brothers. It
was only after the ending of this so-called Creek War that these Hostile
Creeks moved into Spanish  English territory and became more or less_
allied. with the British in joint hostilities across the border, which continued not only before the Treaty of Ghent was signed, but thereafter.

Whatever damage or injury that might be claimed as having been suffered _

by the Hostile Creeks by the cession of land made by the Treaty of Ft.
Jackson was sustained. by then, not because they were allies of the British
in the War of 1812, but solely because of their war against their own
brothers and Americans in the so-called Creek War. Regardless of the
correctness of the views herein previously expressed with reference to
Article IX and its availability to the Creek Indians — in no event could
said Article be of benefit to any Indian tribe or portion of said tribe
unless those claiming the benefit thereof ceased all hostilities against
the United States after the ratification of said treaty by the parties thereto. It is submitted that the great weight of the evidence as to the
activities of thetidostile Creeks as found by the findings of fact which

constitute a @t hereof subseqient to the execution of the Treaty of

Ghent Show that said Hostile Creeks failed to comply with the provisions

of said article as to ceasing hostilities against the United States, and
continued said hostilities long after the effective date of said Treaty
of Ghent.

Without restating the record of the activities of said Hostile Creeks
as appearing in -said findings oi fact, it would seem sufficient merely to
refer to same and to say that in our opinion said activities do not seem
to have been for the purpose of. securing the return of what said Creeks
considered their lands by keeping the peace, if the return of their lands
was their objective,  ‘were seeking the return of same by making war.
It is our opinion that the notives of these Hostile Creeks were more
likely to be to serve British interests for the compensation they probably
were receiving in money as well as positions of prominence‘ from the
British.

For the reasons hereinabove set out, we affirm the opinion ‘rendered
by this Coinnission on April 22, 1952, and the award therein made to the
Creek Nation in the sun of $1,769,930, less such offsets, if any, as
may hereafter be allowed in accordance with Sec. l2_ of the General En_'Les
of Procedure or this Commission." '

United States in the treaty of cession of that year,
