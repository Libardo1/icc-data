FINDIRGS OF FACT

The Commission.makes the following Findings of Fact which are
supplemental to its Findings of Fact Nos. l to 29, inclusive, entered
January 18, 1957, and amended February 6, 1958:

30. By'Article 15 thereof} the Omaha treaty of March 16, 1854,
10 Stat- 1093, became obligatory upon the parties thereto when ratified by the United States. This occurred April 17, 185A. The land
here involved, which.was ceded by that treaty, is to be valued as of
that date.

313 The 4,982,097.87 acres here involved are described in our
Finding of Fact No. 28 as amended. The tract is located in northeastern Nebraska and encompasses all of Cedar, Pierce,'Wayne, Stanton,
Cumin83;3Dak0ta, Dodge, Washington, Douglas, Burt and Sarpy counties,
most of Dixon County and parts of Knox, Colfax, Antelope, Boone,
Madison and Platte Counties. The tract lies within the Missouri river
‘watershed and drains to the southeast with a waterfall of from six to

ten inches. It is bounded on the north and east by the Missouri river,

6-Ind. c1. Com. 730 731

on the south by the Platte river and the Elkhorn river flows through
it from northwest to southeast. I-{any of the tributary streams within
it are spring-fed but the northwest section is fairly arid. In the
field notes of the original surveys conducted during l855 through
1866, ten of the 2i,3 townships containing Omaha cession land which
were then surveyed were described as destitute of water, some ten
others were described as partially so, and some thirty-five are said
to be poorly watered. The elevation ranges from 1,000 to 2,000 feet.
The uplands are rolling with gentle slopes to the terraces. From
terrace to bottom lands the slopes are frequently steep and in some
places along the Missouri river they are precipitous. Some overflow
is reported along the I-‘T_"1.ssouri river as well as along the Platte
river. Only the Missouri river is navigable.

32. Annual temperature varies from A80 '00 5303 Precipitation
varies from22_.2Z+" in Knox county to 30.22" in Cumings county, trith
an average of 2'7", whereas 30 inches _is normally regarded as necessary for good agriculture. Rainfall is heaviest during the growing
season and is frequently excessive over brief periods of time.
(Def. BX. 122, p. 51-2) The soil has a lime subsoil with good water
retention capacity. The length of the growing‘ season varies from
145 days in the western section to 170 days in the east. The area is
adapted to raising stock and growing small grains, although during
the 8I‘0WiI1g season wheat is found to be especially susceptible to rust.

33. The soil is classified as East loess Hill land, which E‘«I"~’-‘o-V37"-"

land Use Capability Hap published in a l9i+9 issue of the Nebraska
Experimental Station Bulletin I50. 395 (Pet. Ex. 358, p. 135), which
is based upon a 191.2 field survey, gives an acreage classification
within the Omaha cession as listed below. For purposes of interpretation, Class I land is silty textured, well drained and nearly
level. CI ass :1 land is gently sloping, of silty content, and may
require subsurface tillage or contour f arming to avoid runoff and
erosion. Class III land is rolling, subject to rapid water erosion
under cultivation, susceptible to wind erosion, and requires con»
servation practices to sustain production. Class IV lani is very
susceptible to erosion, being steeply rolling or moderately sandy.
It should be cropped only intermittently. Class V land is poorly
lned or alkali soil on relatively flat flood plains and subject
to flooding. It is suitable only for permanent grasses. Class VI
is suitable only for grazing, is finely textured, susceptible to
severe wind  water erosion, or it is steeply sloping, or gravelly
and stony. Class VII is sandy land, and steep, broken areas with
sparse vegetation. Class VIII is wasteland. The last two classes
may be grazed if conservation is practiced in a moderate degree in
the first instance and to a restricted degree in the second. (Pet.
 303: PP.» 21-5) In 1852;. these soils were in general in a better

condition than is reflected by this table:

34. with but few exceptions the timber upon this tract is confined to streambeds, ranging from a few trees up to narrow belts as
‘wide as 2&0 feet along the stream.banks. It is cottonwood, box elder,
elm, oak, some black walnut, white ash, cedar, hickory, sugar and longheaded black and silver leafed maples, with other species. The original
field notes fail to comment upon the presence of timber in 13 townships. Only in 11 interior townships and 36 fractional border townships
is it reported in quantity sufficient to interest a settler, and 8h
townships were reported to be completely destitute of all timber. with
the exception of a very few townships, the timber appears to be confined
‘to a few sections,in each. None of it possessed a commercial value in
185A. (Davis, Trans. P. 340) Sawmills were constructed at an early
date, however, and the available lumber was used for fencing, posts,
ridge poles and like purposes.

35. Other than building stone which was:reported in the field
notes of the original survey 2s_being present within a number of the
townships, there were in 1855 no known.minerals within the Omaha
tract.

35. Due to immigration from Europe the population of the United

States increased rapidly after I830. An estimated increase from

6~Ind.Cl.Com. 730 73a

12,866,020 people that year to 17,089,453 in 18h0 included 599,125
immigrants; the increase to 23,191,875 in 1850 included 1,713,250
immigrants and the estimated increase to 31,Ah3,321 in 1860 included
2,598,214 immigrants. The population density moved steadily westward and transportation terminals moved up the Missouri river;from
Chariton, Missouri in 1819 to Kansas City by 1840, Council Bluffs by
1850 and Sioux City subsequent to 1855. The river was subject to
‘winter ice, shifting sand bars and seasonally low water but by 1854 it
carried more traffic to the important river ports of Council Bluffs
and Bellevue than arrived by overland travel. At these points emigrant trains made up and were outfitted for their trek westward,
traveling along the north banks of the Platte river through Fremont,
Columbus and Fort Kearney. ln 18h6-7 the first wagon-train of Mormons,

383 individuals, wintered at Florence, and the heavy stream of Mormon

traffic through Fremont during the next decade gave their name to the
Mormon trail. In 1855 the western route was designated a military
road. Two years later a second Federal road, running through the
subject tract from Bellevue northwest to the Niobrara river valley,
was authorized. Ferries were built across the Missouri at Florence

in 18A? and across the Elkhorn. (Pet. Ex. 356, p. 102) The Ioup

river was first ferried at Columbus during 1850.

Another popular western route ran from St. Joseph, Missouri,
into Kansas, entered Gage County, Nebraska and followed the south
bank Of the Platte river, passing a considerable distance south“C33 Of the subject tract,

6-Ind. c1. Com. 730 J 735

.37. On the valuation date the railroad terrrinated east of the
‘Mississippi river, in Illinois , but a line to St. Joseph, Missouri,
was under consideration. The huge increase in population, the
Mexican Purchase of l8l;6, settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute
with Canada and the establishment in ‘Oregon of a provisional government which it was feared  seek independent sovereign status,
Sutter‘s discovery of gold in California on January 12, l8Z,»8, and the
western hegira of the Mormon faithful all contributed to an increasing
national desire to reach the western coast by railroad. Congress
authorized a survey to determine the most feasible route west of the
Missouri in 1853 and an exploratory trip through Omaha country and
Nebraska Territory was made in 1856. On the valuation date tree western routes were being considered, one via St. Joseph and passing south
of the subject tract; one across the northern tip of the subject tract
from Sioux City, w‘nich in 1855 had only two cabins (Pet. Ex. 315, p.
#00) and up the Niobrara river valley, and one across the southern tip
of the tract, running west from Council Bluffs along the north side‘ of
the Platte river. The decision to adopt the Council Bluffs route was
made in 1863 and the railroad reached that _town three years later.
(Pet. Ex. 356)

38. When the Kansas-Nebraska Territorial Act was passed on May
30: 1351+, the slavery question was left to the future decision of-the
settlers. While both pro-slavery  anti -slavery forces immediately
moved to secure a foothold by early settlement, attention was concentrated on Kansas and slavery had little, if any, effect upon the

6—Ind.Cl.Com. 730 A 736

rate of settlement in Nebraska. The first census of that state was
taken November 20, 1851., at which time there were l,692 males,

1,127 females and 13 slaves, a total of 2,832 people recorded. Ten
years later there were 9, 580 people in the state, exclusive of
Indians. The various census of those counties encompassing the
Omaha cession of 185; list 9lA'whites in 185A, 1,535 whites in 1855,
and 9,636 in 1860, at which time there were 171,468 acres or 2.88%
of th.e'.:area in farms.

39. Trading posts and military forts were the first white
structures in Nebraska. A trading post was built at Bellevue in 1810;
the Council Bluffs Indian Agency was moved there in 1823, a post
Office was added in 1813.5 and a town company was organized February 9,
1851.. Fort Atkinson was built in 1819 and abandoned in 1827; Fort

houn was built in 1821., and Fort Kearney in 1848. (Pawnee Tribe

V. United States, Ind. Cl.Com. Dkt 10) Florence grew from the
Mormon wintering quarters of 1846-7. Omaha, Desoata, Fontenelle and
Tekemah were settled in 1851+. Within 10 years of its‘ cession l5
settlements were established within the subject area. (Pet. Ex.
358, P. 181.)

11.0. With the passage of the Territorial Act of 1851;, the Pre97-I1P'5i01’i Act Of 181+]. (5 Stat. 453) amended March 27, l85l;., bedame
applicable to the public domain in Nebraska. Under it settlers entering Upon the Imsurveyed public domain acquired the right to purchase up to 160 acres for $1.25 per acre if paid before the land

was offered at public sale. Under the Act of April 21;, 1820, 3 Stat.566,

6-Ind.Cl.Com. 730 737

the surveyed public domain was available at public auction in 80-acre
tracts at a minimum of $1.25 per acre, and unsold land could be bought
in 160-acre tracts at that price following the auction. Military scrip
and land warrants were applicable upon the purchase at $1.25 per acre,
and after 1852 these were assignable. During 185A-5 they were listed
on the stock markets as low as $1.08 and $1.10 per acre.

The Graduation Act, proposed as early as 1840, and passed August 4,
1854 (10 Stat. 57h), reduced the minimum of unsold public land according to a schedule based upon the years it had been offered. It was replaced by the Homestead Act of 1862. Hhile it did not apply to the
subject tract, its provisions served to enhance the competitive value
of lands affected thereby.

Al. The early settlers expressed a decided preference for sites
near transportation routes with available timber or stone for building and fencing purposes and an.adjoining tract of prairie which could
‘be farmed without time and labor expended in clearing the land. Defendant‘s Exhibits 123 and 125 clearly illustrate that the land speculators and settlers first entered the Omaha cession in the southeast.
Surveys were first run.there. As settlements were made along the

Platte, Elkhorn, Maple and Missouri rivers the surveys were run along

them. According to the June 30, 1856, report of the Commissioner of tha

General Land Office to the Secretary of the Interior “most of the 583tled district had been surveyed"aeHof that date. (Pet.'Exl358, yufi
B? the close of 1858 80% of the cession land’ was surveyed and the entire area was marked off before 1867.

6—Ind.Cl.uom. 730 A 738

42 Prior to 1857 the Omaha land Office which was established
duly 22, 185A, included all land in Nebraska to whichslndian title
had been extinguished. This comprised eastern and central Nebraska
and included the Kansas cession of 1825, (7 Stat. 2AA, Royce Area
124,,B.A.E., Vol. 18, Pt. 2, Nebr. Map 1); the Otoe, etc. cession of
1830 (7 Stat. 328, Royce Area 155, supra); the Otoe and Missouria
cessions of 1833 (7Stat. A29, Royce Area 186, supra) and 185A (10
Stat. 1038, Royce Area 31b); and the two Pawnee cessions of 1833
(7 Stat. 448, Royce Area 191, supra) and l8h8 (9 Stat. 9&9, ROYCE
Area 270,supra), as well as the land under valuation. Up to September 20, 1856, only 786 pre—emption claims were registered with
this office and up to January 1, 1858, only 28,590.38 acres were purchased under pre-emption.

A total of 3,7h6,Lh0 acres were offered in the first public
land sale which opened in 1859. (Pet. Ex. 358, p. 373) Only
802,000 acres were disposed of for cash, scrip or warrants prior to
July 1, 1859. Roughly, approximately 2/3 of the Omaha cession remained unsold eight years after its purchase. The record does not
disclose when the last lands were disposed.of.

43. "From 1849 onward, soil exploitation was the method adhered
to in the prairie farring procedure. The cheapness and abundance of
the land coupled with new labor saving machinery influenced the farmr
ers, who could so afford, to plant larger and larger fields of crops."

(Davis, Pet. Ex. 358, p. 318) The reaper, the steel plow which

scoured itself in.the prairie sod, the.mower, planter, roller, cultivator,

6-Ind.Cl.Com. 730 739

drill and harrow were recent inventions. The thresher and wire
fencing were developed in 1850. A pioneering farmer could expect
to spend about $1,000 preparing to farm. Common labor at Council
Bluffs drew from $1.50 to $2.50 per day; agricultural labor earned
$150 annually plus board and room. Sod breaking averaged $2.50
per acre but varied from $1.50 to $5.00 per acre. Fencing for #0
acres cost from $112. to $22h'with 160 acres requiring twice that.
Many settlers substituted Osage hedge for fence but if timber was
purchased the average cost increased to $320 for 40 acres and as
,much as $1,000 for 160 acres. Draft animals cost from $150 to
$200 each; cattle $500 a head. A log cabin ran.from $25 to $100; a
four-room cottage from $h25 to $A50. 3eed Wheat 008? from $1 to $2
per acre. Family maintenance from arrival until the first crop was
harvested usually ran $l,000.i Transportation from Boston to St. Louis
per person was $29 first class and $13 emigrant class; from St. Louis to
Council Bluffs cabin fare was $12 and deck passage $5. (Def.'Ex. ll5)
LA. Economically the country experienced a financial panic in
18h? which lasted about two years. Theggradual recovery suffered a
second recession the last of 1853, and other low periods prevailed
in August, 1857, and immediately before and after the Civil'War in
1861 and l855. These depressive periods would not have been anticipated by a prospective purchaser or seller of the Omaha land in l85A,
but their effect would have been less noticeable in the western countries where the railroad had not yet penetrated and the market was

dependent upon local supply and demand. The St. Joseph, Missouri,

-Ind. Cl. Con. 730 71,0

tie On 3'33? 3 , l85L; quoted the following local prices:

Wheat:
Ordinary to fair ‘ 3 .95 to 3 1.00 per bu,
Prime to strictly prime 1.00 to- 1.20 per bu,
E835 .10 per doz.
Butter .12 to .15 per lb.
Lard ~ .065 to .08 per lb.
Mules 65.00 to-125.00 each

The Council Bluffs Eagle in 1855 quoted flour at $5 per hundredweight, corn and oats 30¢ per bushel, wheat $1.25 per bushel and common
labor at $1 to $2.50 per day, and commented: "Stock of ‘all kinds bears
a good price, from the fact of this place being the great outfitting
emporium for inmgrants westward.“ (Def. Ex. 122, p. 91;)

1+5. The parties are agreed that a prospective purchaser of the

.aha cession on April 17, 1851., could expect to pay not less than 8%
interest upon any money required to. finance such purchase.

1-.6. The obvious preference for homesites along the established
emigrant routes and along the waterways with timbered areas resulted in
less attractive land, particularly in the older states, remaining unsettled or being abandoned in favor of more preferable sites in the
‘~'€S‘5- The vast amount of federally held land had by 102.0 caused Congress to evidence concern about the manner of its acquisition and disP9sition. A number of Congressional investigations were made and
several reports are of record. 0f the 1,360 ,l00 ,000 acres available
within the United States on June 30, 1853, there were £;,,l00,000 acres

in 111111013: 22,700,000 acres in Missouri and 22,800,000 acres in Iowa.

6~Ind.Cl.Com. 730' 7&1

‘With the passage of the Graduation Agt on August 4, 1856, the follow- .
ing acreages in the United States, Iowa and Eissouri became available

at the reduced prices stated below}

_Inf0rmation concerning the amount of unsold public land in the
various states would have been available to a prospective purchaser
of the Omaha land in 1856, and the imminent passgge df legislation‘
reducing its minimum price would hare been known to a well informedi
and interested prospective purchaser,

#7. iThe immigrants arriving yearly from.Europe were a body I
of potential buyers which a prospective purchaser of the Omaha
land would have considered when determining the rate of turnover:
he could anticipate. The effect of this group upon the disposition of the public domain is reflected in the following table:

1.8. Under Nebraska Territorial law, capital stock of a proposed
bank could be paid for with promissory notes which the bank discounted.
'i‘he right of operation included authority to print currency. At least
six banks and one insurance company functioning is a bank opened in
Nebraska Territory shortly after March, l855_.w“"I-‘he direct effects of
this falsifying and cheapening of money were fast felt. The use of
cheap money to the exclusion of all else gave inflated values to
claims , to:-rr1;-.lotse and other property. In the trade of the world the
most plentiful substance is the cheapest. As a result-, land and other
commodities were higher than money and kept skyrocketing as money depreciated. People rested in false security in this artifical prosperity. The governor was so fooled by the psuedo prosperity that he mentioned in his message to the Legislative Assembly, as evidence of the
gaod times in Nebraska, that town lots had advanced from $300 to
$3,000 each." (Davis, Pet. Ex. :238, P» 272, 273) This Situation C011"
tinued until the collapse of all but one Nebraska bank during the financial panic of 1857. While ‘Iowa had strict laws governing the
issuance of currency by banks in that Territory much ‘wildcat’ currency
issued by banks of other states or territories was circulated there.
Beginning ill 1855 Nebraska currency circulated freely in Iowa. ~

1+9. The established policy of the United States in 1851+ was to
grant each new state land for use in financing internal improvements
and to aid railroads by grants of alternate sections on each side of

their track to a depth of several miles. A well informed prospective

purchaser of the Omaha cession would have known that when Nebraska

End. 83.. Goal. 730 71,3

.:hieved statehood and when the railroads entered the state, both
..ate and railroad land would go on the market without any minimum
sice requirement.

50. The average expense incurred by the Government in disposing
:3 the public domain was .O207¢ per acre for surveying and .0532¢ per
;cre for managing and selling; a total of .O739¢ per acre.

51. Defendant's witness'William G. Murray has previously apgeared before this Commission as a qualified appraiser. His valuazion report is Defendant's Exhibit 122. He relied upon a personal
inspection of the land, the original field notes and the Nebraska
Experimental Station Bulletin for data concerning soil and topograghy, and upon the history of a tract of land in Iowa opposite the
Cmaha cession, 23 townships deep, extending slightly south of the
Cmaha land and running 10 to 12 townships inland east of the
Eissouri River. It is approximately equal in size to the Omaha
session, is slightly preferable in clinate, has more rainfall in the
eastern portion.snd has more timber, but about the same wind- deposited loessial soil and topography. Both tracts are bounded by'the'
Rissouri River, with the Omaha land having the longest river bound3F?. As the proyimity to water transportation affected only nearby

 

land, Mi. Murray considered the Onaha tract was slightly inferior
to the Iowa land on a value basis. Indian title to the Iowa land
was extinguished in l83O and l8hé. About 80 percent was offered

for sale in 1853 or earlier; roughly 9% was offered in 1854 and

6-Ind. Cl. Com. 730 71414.

. at 10% was not on the market until 1858. Only approximately
9% of the total 5,300,000 acres sold before 1855.
M‘. I~Ez;'rray divided the Omaha tract into five land types

and separately valued them as follows: Choice sites along the
Missouri and Platte rivers, 300,000 acres worth $2 per acre;

high quality land near the choice sites, with timber, water and
water transportation available, 700,000 acres worth $1.25 per acre;
medium quality land near streams, having some timber, 800,000 ares
worth 70¢ per acre; poor quality land, with little or no timber and
not suited to settlement, 2,500,000 acres worth 25¢ per acre; very
poor land, without timber, unsuited to settlement, remote from
settlements and water transportation, hilly and poor soil, 650,000

'-res worth 10¢ per acre; from which he arrived at a fair market
value for the entire tract as of April 17, 1851., of 55¢ per acre.
52. Iowa became a territory in 1838. Indian title within

its borders was extinguished through 1832 and 1851;. 69.5% or
22,628,508 acres were surveyed by 1852 and 17,199,028 acres had
been offered for sale. Of this acreage 3,113,813.30 acres

were located with military scrip, 2,810 ,0l+3.51 acres were

sold for cash and 2,595,590.47 acres were granted or reserved

by the state, making a 49% disposition of all surveyed land.

A fatal epidemic of cholera in the middle states and a severe

drought throughout the Ohio valley during the surnner of

6 1nd. Cl. Comm. 730 745

1854 sent homeseekers by the thousands into Iowa during 1854 and
until May 31, 1856, when all Iowa land was withdrawn from market
that the state might make selections for railroad purposes. (Pet.
Ex. 280; 11 Stat. 9) Mch of the available land within the state
was taken up with land warrants which were credited at $1.25 per
acre, but were selling in the east at 84¢ to $1.00 per acre.

The state's population increased from 22,859 in 1838 to 43,112
in 1840 and 192,124 in 1850, at which.time the western 50 or 60 miles
of the state below Council Bluffs had from 2 to 6 persons per square
‘mile. The demand for land did not reach western Iowa until 1853,

when the first public sale was held in the Council Bluffs (Kaneville)
Land Office, which included that land directly east of the Omaha

cession. During its first four years, the following acreages were

sold for cash or military scrip:

1853 First half year 69,040 acres
Second half year 101,745 acres
1854 First half year 135,889 acres
Second half year 174,382 acres
1855 First half year 222,137 acres
Second half year 617,636 acres
1856 Until May 31st 399,932 acres

53. Mr. W. D. Davis, a qualified appraiser who has previously
appeared before this Commission, testified for petitioners as an
expert witness on land values, and submitted a voluminous report
which is identified as Petitioners‘ Exhibit No. 358. Among the data

accumulated in this report is a summarization of all deeds and

None of the records indicated whether the land transferred was
improved, so, proceeding on the premise that railroad sales conveyed
unimproved land, Mr. Davis compared the first 106 railroad sales to 1
the non-railroad sales occurring within the same time period, which
averaged lhl.9 acres each, from which he concluded that 24.26% represented the amount that improvements contributed to the price in
the average land.sale.

(f) Davis also reported that the 1900 census in counties within
the Omaha cession, which was the first attempt to record the separate

value of real estate and improvements, showed buildings alone valued

I

6-Ind. Cl. Com. 730 I 71.9

at 15% of the value for both real estate and buildings. Since the
census record did not consider other improvements such as fences or
cultivated lard , I-Er. Davis adopted the figure of 24.2 33' as being that
percentage representing improvements in all sales considered by him,
exclusive of the railroad sales‘. By comparing 27 sales occurring between 1857 and 1870 (3 to 16 years after the appraisal date) conveying
over 1,000 acres apiece, averaging 3,362 acres and having a weighted
average consideration of $2.42 per acre, with some 1,077 sales occurring during the same period, averaging 229 acres and having a weighted
average consideration of $4.20 Mr. Davis concluded the public would
pay 5.2.3953 less for large tracts than for smaller units.

The weighted average price of $2.71» Per acre for the‘ .71..-transfers
occurring between 1853 through 1855 was then reduced by 2l..26f€ to
$2.08 which Mr. Davis considered its “bare land " fair market value.
Upon deducting 42.3953 for size,  Davis concluded $1.19 per acre was
the "bare land" value of large tracts, but gave no consideration to the
respective dates of sale. In like manner the weighted average price
01' $1+.l2 per acre for all non-railroad sales prior to 1860 was adjusted
'00 $1.80 per acre.

51+. Mr. Davis also took into consideration sales occurring between 1790 and 1866 of several very large tracts of land, most of them
being in the eastern states. The one nearest the Omaha cession was
the 7993515-1+2 acres oi‘ land in Cherokee and Crawford counties, Kansas,
sold to the Cherokee Indians for 62-33¢ per acre in 1836, and to James F.

Joy for $1 per acre in 1868. No attempt was made to compare these to

\

Omaha land. From all the data included in his report, Hr. Davis
nlaced a value of $1.50 per acre upon the Omaha cession land as of
april 17, l85h.

55. The best potential use for the Omaha land on April 17, l85L,
ras for crop and.livestock farming.

56. On.April 17, l85h, the fair market value of the 4,982,097.87
ores comprising the Omaha cession was 75¢ per acre, or a total of
~3,736,573.z.o. The sum of $975,739.51». paid the petitioners for Said
.and on that date was so far removed from its fair.market value as to
»e unconscionable, and petitioners may recover" the difference Of
i2,760,833.8S of the defendant, less such offsets and credits as may

.ereafter be deter:dned.to be due it.
