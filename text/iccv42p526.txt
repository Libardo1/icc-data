ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR
FINAL SEVERANCE OF CLAIMS, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES

On July 14, 1978, plaintiffs under the above-captioned dockets
filed a motion for final severance of the claim of the Aleut
Community of St. George Island from Docket 369, for consolidation
of said claim for all purposes with Docket 352, and for entry of
final award in the newly—consolidated dockets. Defendant replied
in opposition on August 7, 1978, asserting that such an order would
prejudice defendant because the claims remaining under Docket 369
after severance have not been stated with sufficient clarity and
detail to inform defendant and the Commission as to what those

claims are.

The Commission has previously held that the claim of the Aleut
Community of St. George Island pleaded under Docket 369 presented

questions of law and fact identical with questions under the Docket
352 claim of the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island and different

than the questions to be resolved with respect to any other possible
claims under Docket 369, 36 Ind. Cl. Comm. 235, 249 (1975). At the

42 Ind. Cl. Com. 526 52?

same time, the Commission ordered the severance of the St. George
claim from Dcket 369 and its consolidation for trial with the St.
Paul claim under Docket 352, 36 Ind. Cl. Com. at 252.

On June 9, 1978, the Commission entered an interlocutory award,
subject to offsets, on the claim so consolidated for trial, 42 Ind.
C1. Comm. 1, 152. Defendant, however, does not claim offsets against
the interlocutory award. See defendant's Memorandum accompanying
response in opposition, August 7, 1978, at 3.

Having considered defendant's objections, the Comission concludes that no prejudice will ensue to defendant as a result of
granting plaintiffs’ motion, that the claims decided by the
Commission's decision at 42 Ind. C1. Comm. 1 (1978) are now ripe

for entry of final award and that, consequently, plaintiffs‘ motion
should be granted.

It is the law of the case here that the St. George claim_in
Docket 369 and the St. Paul claims in Docket 352 are identical with
each other and different than any remaining claims in Docket 369 and
that said distinguishable claims are severable, 35 Ind. Cl. Comm. at
249, 252, supra. Upon entry of final award on those claims decided
by the Commission at 42 Ind. Cl. Comm. l, supra, said claims will be

res judicata and, therefore, not relitigable in any form under Docket
369. Finally, entry of such a final award will not in any way reflect

upon the viability or the merits of any of those claims allegedly
remaining under Docket 369.

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the claim of the Aleut Community

of St. George Island which, by Comission order of July I8, 1975,
36 Ind. Cl. Comm. 252, was severed from the other claims of The
Aleut Tribe, et al., under Docket 369 and consolidated for trial
with the claims of the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island under
Docket 352, and with respect to which claim, together with said claims
under Docket 352, the Commission on June 9, 1978, 42 Ind. Cl. Comm.
at 152-53, entered an interlocutory award in favor of plaintiffs in
the amount of $11,239,604, be, and the same hereby is, finally
severed from any other claims alleged under Docket 369, designated
as Docket 369-A and captioned Aleut Community of St. George Island
v. The United States of America, and

42 Ind. c1. Comm. 526 528

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that said Docket 369~A be, and the same
hereby is, consolidated with Docket 352 for the purpose of entering

final judgment in said dockets. A separate final award in said
consolidated dockets will be concurrently entered.

Dated at Washington, D. C. this 30th day of August
1978.
