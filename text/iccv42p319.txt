ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT
The Commission makes the following findings of fact, which are
in addition to such of the 22 findings in our decision of May 9,

1973 (30 Ind. Cl. Comm. 259-281), as are applicable to the present

plaintiff.

23. Rehearing on Eastern Boundary of Aboriginal Title Area.

On November 26, 1975, the Commission entered an order in this case

which in pertinent part read as follows:
ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR REHEARING

UPON CONSIDERATION of plaintiff's motion for rehearing
and amendment of the Commission's findings, filed on
July 25, 1975; defendant's opposition thereto, filed on
October 6, 1975; plaintiff's reply, filed October 16,
1975; and the record in this case, the Commission is
satisfied that the eastern boundary of the Santo Domingo
aboriginal title area as delineated in the map accompanying the stipulation filed herein, 30 Ind. Cl. Com. 234,
259-260, and incorporated into our finding of fact No. 2,

_ E, at 30 Ind. Cl. Comm. 264, did not reflect the intent

of counsel for the plaintiff, and that the foregoing
inaccuracy occurred through inadvertence in describing
the aforesaid boundary to the Bureau of Land Management,

which prepared the map of the Santo Domingo aboriginal
title area.

42 Ind. Cl. Com. 306 320

The Commission concludes:

(1) That it has jurisdiction to relieve plaintiff of

that part of the stipulation incorporated in finding
No. 2, E.

(2) That plaintiff may suffer substantial injustice if
it is not so relieved.

(3) That defendant has not shown it will suffer prejudice
if plaintiff is so relieved.

(4) That plaintiff's proposed amendment to finding No.
2, E, cannot be adopted by the Commission, because:

(a) Defendant has had no opportunity to present
evidence on where the eastern boundary of
tract E should be, and

(b) The proposed amendment is vague, not indicating

whether or not it includes the ore bodies of
the Tiffany and Cash Entry mines.

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED:

1. That plaintiff's motion for rehearing be, and it
hereby is, granted.

a * x * *

Accordingly, a trial was held on May 18-20, 1977, in which oral
and documentary evidence was received on the question of the true
eastward extent of plaintiff's area of aboriginal use and occupancy.

The plaintiff's proposed findings and brief were filed herein

on September 1, 1977. The defendant's were filed on December 20,

1977, and the plaintiff's reply on May 2, 1978.

24. Description of the Claimed Area. The additional area

claimed by plaintiff in this phase of the case adjoins the plaintiff's

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 306 321

prior aboriginal title award on the east and covers approximately

4,300 acres. The description is as follows:

From a point one mile due east of the southeast
corner of the Los Cerrillos Grant run southwesterly to the southeast corner of Section 8,

T. 14 N., R. B E.;

Thence southwesterly to Devil's Throne;
1/
Thence northeasterly to Mt. Chalchihuitl;

Thence northwesterly to the point at which the
south boundary of the Sitio de Los Cerrillos Grant
intersects a line projected from Turquoise Trading

Post to Mt. Chalchihuitl;

Thence easterly along the south boundaries of the
Sitio de Los Cerrillos Grant and the Los Cerrillos

Grant to the southeast corner of the latter.
Thence one mile due east to the point of beginning.

No Spanish or Mexican land grants confirmed by the United

States lie within the above area.

25. Turquoise Mines in Claimed Area. The plaintiff's claim to

the additional area described in the preceding finding rests largely

upon asserted aboriginal use and occupancy of what have been referred

2/
to as two turquoise "mines." It is clear from the evidence, however, that the Indians are claiming use of two turquoise mining

zones. This use of the word "mine" and its Spanish cognate "mine"

if This name was misspelled "Chalchihuntl" in our previous finding
at 30 Ind. Cl. Comm. 264.

_g/ The Tiffany and Cash Entry mines, named in the motion for
rehearing and amendment of findings, were American mines opened in
the late 19th century over earlier Indian and Spanish workings.
The Cash Entry was not even a turquoise mine. See def. ex. 9 at

62, and finding 27, below.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 306 — 322

in the sense of mining zone has precedent in older New Mexico usage.

See pl. ex. 4 at 94, fn. 1, def. ex. 34 at 173.

The zones involved here are the Turquoise Hill in section 21,

T. 15 N., R. 8 E., and the Mount Chalchihuitl in section 5, T. 14 N.,
R. 8 E., N.M.P.M. These and other localities in the neighborhood
were worked for turquoise by prehistoric Indians and, in the late

19th and early 20th centuries, by white Americans Pl. exs. 17 at

52, def. ex. 42 at 14.

The most remarkable turquoise mine in the area is the great
pit on the southeastern slope of Mount Chalchihuitl. This was the
site of the most extensive prehistoric mining operations on the
American continent. P1. ex. 18 at 52. W. P. Blake was probably

the first American to publish a description of it. In 1858, he
wrote as follows in the American Journal of Science (Vol. 22 at

277 -- pl. supp. ex. 51):

On reaching the locality I was struck with astonishment at the extent of the excavation. It is an immense
pit with precipitous sides of angular rock, projecting
in crags, which sustain a growth of pines and shrubs in
the fissures. On one side the rocks tower into a precipice and overhang so as to form a cave; at another
place the side is low and formed of the broken rocks
which were removed. From the top of the cliff, the
excavation appears to be 200 feet in depth and 300 or
more in width. The bottom is funnel-shaped and formed
by the sloping banks of the debris or fragments of the
sides. On this debris, at the bottom of the pit, pine
trees over a hundred years old are now growing, and the
bank of refuse rock is similarly covered with trees.

This great excavation is made in the solid rock, and tens

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 306 323

of thousands of tons of rock have been broken out. This
is not the only opening; there are several pits in the
vicinity, more limited in extent, some of them being
apparently much more recent.

* it it i *

The evident antiquity of this excavation, and its extent,
renders it peculiarly interesting. Little or nothing appears
to be known of it in that region, and I am not aware that

it has ever been visited except by the Indians and New
Mexicans. It seems hardly possible that such an amount

of rock could have been removed by men without the aid of
powder and machinery. The evidences were, however, conclusive that it was the work of the aborigines long before
the conquest and settlement of the country by the Spaniards.
It does not appear that anything has been done in the great
pit for a long time. This is shown not only by the pine
trees growing in it, but by the lichen—covered sides, and
by the piles of rock, gray with age, around the margin.
Fragments of ancient Indian pottery can easily be found
among the rocks at all of the excavations. It is said that

the Indians have a tradition that eight or nine of their
tribe were once suddenly buried by a fall of rocks from the
side of the great pit. Since that time they have been afraid

to work in it. This is probable, and it is indicated by the
condition of the locality.

Aboriginal mining of turquoise in the Cerrillos district is said to

have begun more than 12 centuries ago. Activity in the claimed area was
at its height between ll50 and 1650 A.D. The mining was commercial, and
it was no minor market the stone hammers supplied. Blue gems were

traded in incredible numbers to the Pueblos of Chaco Canyon in northwestern New Mexico, to Arizona, to the Plains Tribes to the north and
east, and into Mexico. Cerrillos turquoise supplied the pre—Columbian

Aztecs and the Mayas of Yucatan. Pl. exs. 14 at 33, 16 at 529-530,

45, 46, 71.

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 306 324

The closest pueblos to the claimed area were Santo Domingo,

Cochiti, San Marcos, Galisteo, San Cristobal and San Lazaro

(see map on following page). The people of Santo Domingo and
cochiti speak the Keres (also spelled "Queres") language; those
of Galisteo, San Cristobal, and San Lazaro spoke Tano, Tano being
the southern division of the Tewa. Early Spanish observers and

later American investigators do not agree among themselves on the

language of San Marcos. Some state it was Tano, some Keres. The
well-known 19th Century anthropologist, A. F. Bandelier, thought

there were both Tanos and Keres in the pueblo. All the pueblos

named above were abandoned during the Pueblo Revolt (1680-1694).

When Spanish rule was reestablished, Santo Domingo and Cochiti were
reoccupied. They still exist. Of the four more easterly pueblos,

only Galisteo was repopulated. Drought, famine, disease and raids

by wild tribes caused its final abandonment in 1792. P1. ex. 4

at 92-93, 8 at 217, 12 at 267-270, 24 at 325-326, 339; def. exs.

3 at 102, 12 at 56; pl. supp. ex. 58 at xxxvii.

In the latter part of the 500 years between 1150 and 1650, at least.

the majority of the turquoise mining in the claimed area was carried on

by the Indians from San Marcos. The nearest pueblo to the great pit, San

Marcos was located about 2 1/2 miles east of Mt. Chalchihuitl.

Other Indians seem to have recognized that the San Marcos people

held first claim to the valuable deposits of blue stone. San

Marcos is called "Turquoise Pueblo" in the Tewa language; this
probably was the Tano name also. Pl. exs. 23 at 4, 26 at 27, ex.
43; def. ex. 22 at 55, 31 at 109, 42 at 13. There is only a
scintilla of evidence that the Galisteo people mined turquoise

after the abandonment of San Marcos. P1. ex. 1 at 20-21.

There has been no large scale work by Indians in the great
turquoise pit since the Pueblo Revolt. The traditional explanation,
among Anglo-Americans, is some version of the following. This one
is from J. L. Hayward,The Los Cerillos Mines (1880) (pl. ex. 10 at
4):

. This, so history states, is where the slide
occurred, in the year 1680, that buried some twentyfive Indians. The Spaniards, making a requisition
upon the neighboring Pueblo of San Marcos for more
Indians, to take the place of those buried, were refused,
perhaps from a superstitious fear. The Spaniards
attempted to enforce their orders, whereupon the
Indians revolted, and after a severe struggle, drove

the Spaniards from the country. Several years later
the Spaniards returned, but they have never re-opened

or attempted to work the mines. There is a tradition
that before the Indians would allow the Spaniards to
return they obliged them to take a solemn oath never
again to work the mines.

The legend is fiction. One notes how in 22 years the 8 or 9
buried Indians mentioned by Blake had grown to 25. Actually, the
Spaniards had little interest in turquoise, and did not disturb its
Indian miners. Pl. exs. 4 at 94, 16 at 531; def. ex. 3 at 93, 94,

ex. 35 at 56; and see finding 27, below.

42 Ind. Cl. Com. 306 327

The truth is the great mine was exhausted, probably before

the Pueblo Revolt. In 1880 one D. C. Hyde thoroughly explored

the site, sinking shafts in the bottom of the main pit, on the summit
of the hill, and on the southeast side, and tunneling out from them.
Cavern-like excavations were found on each side. Many stone-age
tools were encountered; one hamer, weighing several pounds, still
had the handle attached. Numerous veins of turquoise one—eighth to
2 inches thick were found in one of the caves. Nevertheless, after
the expenditure of thousands of dollars, the project proved unsuccessful. The ancient miners had not left sufficient values
behind to pay for the work. Pl. exs. 14 at 33, 23 at 25; def. exs.
28 at 273, 48 at 1066-1067.

26. Other Early Mining In Claimed Area. In and around the
claimed area numerous veins of lead-zinc ore occurred, associated
with some silver and a little copper and gold. The Spaniards were
interested in metalliferous minerals, particularly lead for bullets
and silver for money, and they worked a number of these lodes. The
Mina del Tiro in NW 1/4 sec. 8, T. l4 N, R. 8 E., within this claimed
area,may be the first mine operated by Europeans in what is now the
United States. It was worked for 1800 feet along the outcrop and
to an unknown depth. Below the 125 foot level it is filled with

water that cannot be sounded because of the stairstepped shaft.

This shaft is broken by landings at 12 to 14 foot intervals, to

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 306 328

permit the miners to climb on notched poles, carrying the ore and
debris on their backs on the upward trips. The Spaniards selted the
ore nearby in small furnaces constructed of stones cemented together
with mud. Production was substantial. One account, of unverified
reliability, states the Spanish owners paid $300,000 in tithes on
the Mina del Tiro, indicating $3,000,000 worth of productionP1. exs. 10 at 5, 21 at 157; def. exs. 2 at 207, 12 at 227, 239, 17
at 28, 29, 18 at ll8, 20 at 821, 829, 24 at 67, 28 at 30-31, ex. 60,
ex. 61.

The record contains a copy of a mining concession dated June
2, 1763, from the Spanish Archives of New Mexico (def. ex. 52,

document 865) for two veins of unnamed metals intersecting on the

3/

"south of the hill they commonly call the Chalchiguite." This is

the only Spanish title document in evidence of a mine fairly definitely
within the claimed area. The concession was not confirmed by the
United States, nor, so far as the record shows, even presented for
confirmation. The lack of production records in the Spanish archives

still preserved in Santa Fe suggests that much of the colonial mining

was carried on illegally, to avoid paying royalties to the crown.

Pl. ex. 23 at 30.

_§/ This grant was clearly for the mining of metalliferous minerals.
An ambiguous footnote in F. A. Jones, New Mexico Mines and Minerals
(1904), at page 268, probably refers to this grant, and may have
contributed to the mistaken belief that the Spaniards mined extensively for turquoise. See def. ex. 28 at 268, and cf. def. ex. 40

at 53 (Pogue-1915).

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 306 329

It was not realized until quite recently that the Indians worked
lead mines in the area before the Spaniards arrived. From about 1315
to 1700 A.D., Indians of the Rio Grande area used lead ore to glaze
pottery. In view of the tremendous amounts of glaze-decorated ware
produced during this nearly 400 year period, prehistoric lead mining
must have been extensive. Stone age tools, like those used in the
turquoise pits, have been discovered in some Cerrillos lead mines.
The Mina del Tire and some 11 other mines in or near the claimed
area are now believed to have originally been Indian-operated. The
Spaniards seem to have wholly ousted the Indian from the metallirerous
mines in the claimed area, for glazed pottery ceased to be made after
about 1700; Bandelier, writing in 1892, called it a lost art. Pl. ex.
23 at 31; def. exs. 28 at 30, 42 at 25 (A. H. Warren Archeological
Survey), 53 at 37, 41; pl. supp. ex. 49 at 185; def. reb. ex. 20.
All the mines in the claimed area except the turquoise mines
were abandoned before the American era and most were backfilled,
some as early as the Pueblo revolt. The primitive recovery technology
of the Spaniards, which was capable only of creaming some of highest
values out of the ore, and the remoteness of the mines from the market
are probably.sufficient to explain their abandonment. Pl. exs. 10
at 3, 5, 23 at 30-31, ex. 28; def. exs. 2 at 207, 34 at 172, ex. 61.
There was little or no mining in the claimed area, except for
turquoise, during the period of Mexican rule (1821-1846). In fact,

beyond the exciting strikes and rushes at the Old and New Placers, some

7 to 14 miles south of the town of Cerrillos, only one case of

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 306 330

intensive mining occurred in New Mexico during the years 1820 to 1860.
That was at Santa Rita, far from the claimed area, in the southwest
corner of the Territory. P1. ex. 23 at 10; def. exs. 9 at 24-27,
27 at 5-6, 28 at 23-26, 34 at 173, ex. 52 (document 1162).

In 1866, twenty years into the American period, James F. Meline

wrote from Santa Fe (def. ex. 34 at 170):

New Mexico is very rich, not only in metallic
ores, but in mineral products not metallic. . .
considering the facility of reaching their deposits,

and the incontrovertibly rich yield to be obtained
from them, I cannot but wonder that they should be

allowed to remain comparatively undisturbed, and
almost unproductive.

There is no evidence before us of any beneficial use of the
claimed area except by Santo Domingo Indians from the beginning of
the Mexican period until 1865.

27. American Mining. In the year 1865 attempts were made to

work the few metalliferous mines in and around the claimed area that
had been left open. They were soon abandoned, owing to the area's

remoteness from the outside world. All supplies had to be conveyed

by freight wagons from the Missouri River, a distance of 800 miles.

P1. ex. 10 at 5.

The area remained undisturbed by Americans until January of
1879, when two prospectors from Leadville, Frank Dimmitt (or Dimick)

and Robert Hart, an Englishman, came to the Cerrillos, took a few ore

samples, and returned to Colorado. The assay on the samples started

42 Ind. Cl. Com. 306 331

a stampede. There were fully 1,000 locations made under the U. S.
mining laws during the primary impulse of the excitement, perhaps
half of them within the claimed area. By the autumn of 1880 five
mining camps were in existence in the vicinity, with a total population of from twelve to fifteen hundred. Dimick and Hart's original
camp, soon renamed Turquoise City, was inside the claimed area, in

SW 1/4 sec. 32, T. 15 N., R. 8 E. Another of the camps was at the

old village of Cerrillos, now called Cerrillos Station; the New

Mexican and Southern Pacific Railroad had a depot there that served
as shipping point not only for the Cerrillos mines but also for the
Old and New Placers to the south.

Extensive shafts were sunk on only about 50 or 60 of the claims
in the entire Cerrillos district. The Cash Entry, Grand Central, and
Tom Paine mines were the most extensively developed and were credited
with some production. The Cash Entry and the Grand Central were

within the claimed area; and the Tom Paine was within Area E of

the plaintiff's area of aboriginal occupancy described in our findings

of May 10, 1973, 30 Ind. c1. Com. 234, 264-265. f1. exs. 10 at 5-5,

23 at ll, ex. 43; def. exs. 27 at 10, 28 at 29, 31, ex. 58.
Besides the claims staked for silver and lead, beginning in

1879 or 1880 some hundred or more locations were made around the

Cerrillos for turquoise. The richest proved to be clustered about

Turquoise Hill, an elbow-shaped ridge rising from 100 to 300 feet

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 306 332

above the plains in sec. 21, T. 15 N., R. 8 E. It has four summits.

The main summit is in the NW 1/4 SE l/4 sec. 21. The others are

about 250 yards S. 25° E., about 300 yards west, and about 500 yards
S. 75° W., respectively. Americans found the principal turquoise
deposits in the three lower hills. There were rather extensive
ancient workings over the best deposits and in some places the greater
part of the turquoise had been removed.
The famous Tiffany mine was situated in the southeast hill.

Other claims were located around this mine, but only limited quantities
of turquoise were found. The Old Castilian mine was situated on the
westernmost hill, and around it numerous claims were located,
accompanied by rather extensive prospecting. The openings on the
third hill, lying north and east of this, were small and might be
considered a part of those surrounding the Castilian mine. The
American Turquoise Company bought six claims in the early 1890's,
including those composing the Tiffany mine and part of the Castilian
mine. Workings at the Tiffany consisted of numerous pits, open cuts,
shafts, tunnels, drifts, and stopes. Some of the openings were
ancient, and old stopes were encountered in the American tunnels.

The ancient workings extended down as much as 100 feet. Pl. ex. 23

at 26, def. ex. 48 at 1069-1070, ref. map 7.

Despite D. C. Hyde's earlier unsuccessful exploratory work,

Michael O'Neil and A. B. Renehan opened turquoise mines near Mount

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 306 333

Chalchihuitl in the early twentieth century. Def. Exs. 40 at 53,
48 at 1068-1069.

The mining boom of the Cerrillos Hills was short-lived. In 1904
Jones (32. gig. supra, n. 3) described the once thriving mining towns
of the area as scarcely more than piles of rubbish and fallen walls.
Some mining continued, but in 1911 Douglas B. Sterrett of the U. S.
Geological Survey reported the turquoise mines of the area inactive.

There seems to have been little mining of any kind since. Pl. exs.

9 at 46, 23 at 31; def. exs. 28 at 29, 42 at 18, 30, ex. 48 at 10681071; pl. supp. ex. 72.

There are many conflicting statements on turquoise production
in New Mexico (pl. ex. 16 at 528). Conflicting indications of the
profitability both of the turquoise mines and the metal mines are contained in this record. Production and profitability are not before
the Commission at this stage of the case. While it is clear that there
was some production and some profit, the Commission makes no quantitative findings on these matters.

The plaintiff's members‘ right to mine turquoise in the claimed
area on a non-exclusive basis may have been recognized by the white
miners for a time after the Americans overran it. After an incident
in 1888 when unnamed pueblo Indians attempted to hold off the American

Turquoise Company's manager with gunfire while they mined, the New

Mexico Territorial Legislature enacted a law making it a penitenitiary

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 306 334

offense for an Indian to enter a turquoise claim without permission of
the current owner. The Indians, however, continued to mine surreptitiously; and despite some efforts at enforcement, there appear to
have been few convictions. Pl. ex. 3, ex. 23 at 28-29.

28. Santo Domingo Tradition of Acquiring Title to Turquoise

Area From San Marcos Pueblo. According to the Santo Domingo Indians

who have testified orally in this case, Santo Domingo tradition is
that the Keres-speaking Sun and Corn clans resided at San Marcos and
mined turquoise in the claimed area. At unspecified times in the
past, these clans left San Marcos, migrated to Santo Domingo, and
became members of the Santo Domingo community. After they left,
the Tano—speaking Isi clans continued to reside in San Marcos and
carried on the turquoise mining. Finally the Isi, in two waves,
also abandoned San Marcos and made their way to Santo Domingo,
where their descendants still live. The Santo Domingo Indians
contend that San Marcos owned the turquoise mines, and its
survivors conferred the ownership on Santo Domingo when they migrated there and became members of the Santo Domingo community.
Adolph F. Bandelier, writing in the early 1880's, reported a
similar but not identical tradition (Lang and Riley, ed. The Southwestern Journals of Adolph F. Bandelier 1880-1882, pl. exu 15, def.
ex. 31 at 109):

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 306 335

. Santiago told me that the pits of the Cerillos
were made by the Indians of San Marcos, San Cristobal,
San Lazaro, to whom these turquoise mines belonged.

After they were driven out, they turned over the mines
to the Queres.

In his Final Report of 1892 (pl. ex. 4 at 93) Bandelier wrote:
. . . The Tanos of Santo Domingo regard themselves
as the owners of the site and visit it frequently
to procure the stones that are so much esteemed by
them. .

There is today in Santo Domingo a Sun clan, to whom the turquoise
mines are sacred, and a cane in that c1an's possession in 1954
assertedly belonged originally to the San Marcos war chief. Tr. I-55;
Tr. September 8, 1954, at 47.

The Santo Domingo Indians also have in their possession a very
old painting on buffalo hide, which their expert witness, Florence
Hawley Ellis, stated was of "Saint Cruz," and had been brought to
Santo Domingo from Galisteo Pueblo (not San Marcos) by the Isi clan,
in whose possession it still remained. ggg pl. ex. 1 at 13-17. What
was probably the same painting is identified in testimony of Tomasito

Tenorio, Governor of Santo Domingo, given in 1954, as "the patron

saint, St. Mary, of the San Marcos church." Governor Tenorio further

testified that after being brought from San Marcos it was first placed
in the Santo Domingo church, but when that church caved into the
river in about 1886 it had been rescued and turned over to the Sun

clan, which had held custody ever since. See Tr. Sept. 8, 1954, at

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 306 336

47-49. Dr. Ellis identified the object near the saint's bosom or

hand in the picture as a cross, Governor Tenorio as a sword. See

pl. ex. 1 at 13-17, exs. 38a—f, 39; and_g£. Luke 2:35.

29. Santo Domingo Use of Turquoise Mines. Indian mining of

turquoise continued on a smaller scale after exhaustion of the great

pit. Blake, in the continuation of the last paragraph quoted in

finding 25, above, wrote:

. . . The place is, however, occasionally visited by
Indians from a distance, but their operations appear

to be confined to the surrounding openings, or to
breaking up masses of rock which were formerly removed.

The fragments which they procure are taken to one of the
Indian pueblos on the Rio Grande, where the art of grinding

and perforating them for beads is yet known. How this is
accomplished, I could not ascertain. Two or three Indians,
only, go to the locality at one time, and while there they
live in the cave or recess in the face of the cliff.

James F. Melina, writing 8 years after Blake, stated (pl. ex. 68):

Turquoise, called by the ancient Mexicans Ihalchuitl,
and highly prized by them, is found in veins running
_through a light colored trachyte in the Cerillos, where
exists the silver mine described in a preceding paragraph. It is greatly valued by the Indians, for
ornament, and it is said that numerous moccasin tracks
in the neighborhood of the mine show that it is frequently visited by them at night.

In 1880, the year after the American prospectors overran the claimed

area, an unknown author wrote as follows on the back of a stereopticon

view of the Cerrillos district (pl. ex. 28):

42 Ind. C1. Comm. 306 337

The old turquoise mine, now being operated by an
enterprising person [presumably D. C. Hyde], is an
imense work; especially so when a consideration is had
of the rude facilities in use in the "booming times" of
two hundred years ago. It is known that the Indians
regard this mine, and the pretty blue pieces found there,

with a kind of sacredness. . . These turquoise mines are
said to be the only known ones in America. . . Only one
or two out of many in this district are being worked

just now, other than such as the Indians yet do of
scratching with hands or sticks amongst old dumps for
bits of bright color, which they prize as highly as
their forefathers did.

In 1882, W. B. Sloan found Pueblo Indians working in the Mount
Chalchihuitl pit and reported, "Knowing the Indians seem to think
they have the right to this mine, and being at this time alone, I
did not get any specimens." Def. ex. 59. Lucy Bacon wrote in the
March 1933 issue of New Mexico magazine (pl. ex. 36 at 15):

Even today, though the mines have been under white
domination for centuries, the Indians still visit them.

Special significance is attached to the stones from this
place.

Once in a while groups of Indians come to the site of
the oldest of the holes and go through a ceremony which

is closed to whites. About all that is known of it is
that they drop prayer plumes in the hole.
The pueblo or tribe of the Indians mentioned in the foregoing
articles is not identified. The "one of the Indian pueblos on the

Rio Grande, where the art of grinding and perforating them [turquoise

stones] for beads is yet known," referred to by Blake, however, is

probably Santo Domingo. Bandelier wrote of Cerrillos turquoise

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 306 333

being perforated and polished at Santo Domingo in the early 1880's.
Def. ex. 31 at 109. Professor Blake himself published another article
in 1899, entitled Aboriginal Turquoise Mining, containing the following

statement (pl. supp. ex. 50 at 282):

. . . Kunz records, on the authority of Major Hyde, who
was exploring the Cerrillos locality in 1880, that the
Pueblo Indians from Santo Domingo warned him that the

mine was sacred, and that the turquoise (chalchuite) he
was taking from it must not go into the hands of those

whose saviour was not Montezuma.

Major Hyde was surely the same D. C. Hyde referred to in finding
25, above, whose intensive exploration work proved the great pit
incapable of further commercial production.

Other documentary evidence of the American period expressly
identifies the Indians mining in the claimed area as Santo Domingos.
In addition to Bandelier, quoted in finding 28, above, Governor
L. B. Prince of New Mexico wrote as follows in 1893 (pl. ex. 37):

. . . The neighboring Pueblo Indians of Santa [sic]
Domingo Pueblo Village, had a knowledge of and trade
in such 'Chalchuite' (their name for it, meaning about
what we do in saying money) as they had kept from inheritances and by occasional finds in looking about
these old mines, that they seem to think even now as a

part of their monopoly.

The following article appeared in Southwestern Mines in November

l9l0 (pl. ex. 34):

Threatening him with death if he interfered with
their plans of robbing the Tiffany turquoise mines,
14 miles south of Santa Fe, N. M., a band of Santa

Domingo Indians approached the home of Manager J. P.
McNulty and after leaving a guard of about 16 warriors

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 306 339

at the mouth of the shaft, descended the l25—foot
shaft by means of a rope, ascending with some of the
much sought for stone. Efforts have been made

by Santa Fe officials to capture some of the band, but
so far their chase has been in vain as Mr. McNulty is

unable to identify any of those brought before him.

The Indians still claim the turquoise mines from
which their forefathers took turquoise centuries ago,
but the title is in the American Turquoise Company
which the Tiffanys of New York are the principle
stockholders.

In 1915 the Santo Domingos were called "for a long time the
chief traders in the turquois from Los Cerrillos." P1. ex. 30 at

82.

In 1935, Leslie White wrote in the Memoirs of the American

Anthropological Association (pl. ex. 26, def. ex. 57 at 27):

The Domingo Indians manufacture a great deal of
jewelry. They have easy access to the turquoise mines
at Cerrillos. From a nearby mountain they get a whitish
mineral which they usetm make beads.
Elsie C. Parson in 1939 called Santo Domingo "the turquoise
center" (pl. ex. 17).
Victor Garcia, 78, currently Governor of Santo Domingo, testified

in the trial of this case that he and his father before him mined

turquoise in the claimed area and that non-Santo Domingo Indians did

not. He stated that the mines of the area had belonged to his people
since before the time of Columbus. Tr. I-67-79. Santiago Lovato, a

Santo Domingo Indian 88 years old, testified that he held an important

position of a religious nature with his tribe, which required him to

42 Ind. c1. Comm. 306 340

be familiar with the boundaries of the Pueblo's lands as passed down
from generation to generation. He stated that Mount Chalchihuitl
and what is today known as the Tiffany mine were believed by the

total population of Santo Domingo to be rightfully theirs. He told

of going to mine several times when he was twenty years of age or
younger, and on one occasion chiseling out and carrying away a 25

to 35 pound chunk of turquoise. He stated his father mined in the
area before him and that the Mount Chalchihuitl mine belonged to the
Santo Domingo Tribe before his father was born. Tr. I—82—l0l.

Similar testimony was given by other Santo Domingo witnesses in

1953 and 1954. See Tr. 1953 at 15-18, 26-28, Tr. 1954 at 20-21.

—n—j—..

There is also evidence in the record that other pueblos claimed
the turquoise mines, and some evidence that the pueblos did not
recognize village ownership of natural resources. David Snow,

Curator of Archeology at he Museum of New Mexico, wrote as follows

in 1973 (def. ex. 47 at 41):

The ownership of resource areas by individuals or by
villages or other social groups was not a particularly
well-developed concept among North American Indians.
Feuds over ownership or use of resource areas, however,
have been recorded between some California groups
(Heizer and Treganza 1944). The extent of such contention elsewhere is not known. In the southwest, salt,
like turquoise, was considered a precious commodity and

its gift to the Pueblo Indians is sanctioned in mythological terms in much the same manner as turquoise.

42 Ind. Cl. Com. 306 341

Harrington (19l6:535) was told that salt ‘was not

considered the property of any one tribe ... but the

divine gift of Salt Old Woman, who gave herself freely. . .'
Turquoise deposits probably were similarly considered. However, Santo Domingo Pueblo claims ownership of the Cerrillos
pits through inheritance from the former Tanoan owners
(Lange and Riley 1966:109, 142), as a result of the Pueblo
Revolt of 1680 when the Galisteo villages were abandoned.
The present eastern boundary of the Santo Domingo Pueblo
Grant lies several miles west of the Cerrillos turquoise
deposits and sheer propinquity may be the strongest basis
for the Domingo attitude toward the Cerrillos turquoise
deposits.

Informants in the 1930s stated that the following pueblos

mined turquoise at Cerrillos: Santa Ana, Santo Domingo,
Cochiti, San Felipe, and San Ildefonso. These same sources
claimed that Zuni was not allowed access to the Cerrillos

mines (Gifford l94l:l2S); however, Adair (l944:l29)
recorded that a Zuni Indian, on a trading expedition to
Santo Domingo in the 1890s, requested permission from the
Domingos to mine turquoise at Cerrillos. The Zuni was
referred to the Anglo owner of the mine in Santa Fe, and
for five dollars was given permission.

In contrast to the foregoing, Bandelier wrote in his Final Report

of 1890 (pl. supp. ex. 48 at 157):

Divided into petty communities, the Pueblo traded

with his neighbor, or fought with him, as circumstances

might dictate. Trading was simple exchange, for there
was no money. The solemn dances served often as marts,
where the people came to enjoy themselves and to barter.
But the village Indian also made longer trips for
comercial purposes. In 1540, the Pecos Indians came

to Zuni with buffalo hides. The two extremes, west and
'83SC. possessed distinct comodities, which gave rise

to commerce. Again, certain groups of villages in the
very heart of New Mexico controlled natural resources

coveted by others, and for their possession they bartered

or wrangled. The Tanos held the veins of turquoise, or
kalaite, at the Cerrillos, about twenty miles southwest

of the present Santa Fe. A branch of the Tiguas and
another of the Piros were settled in the neighborhood

of the salt marshes. The Zunis enjoyed a similar privilege
in being within a short distance of the Salines of the
Carrizo. The Queres of San Felipe had in front of their

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 306 342

village large veins of mineral paint, valuable to the
Indian for his pottery. Such and other natural ‘treasures

were guarded as jealously as the limited power of their

possessors permitted; tney both divided the pueblos from
one another at times, and held them together by the great

tie of commercial intercourse.

An article from the Santa Fe New Mexican for December 19, 1910,

tells of the arrest of four Cochiti Indians for unauthorized mining.

The lead paragraph of the article states (pl. ex. 19):

The story of the removal of turquoise from the
Tiffany mines by Indians who still feel that they
have a right to the semi-precious stones used in
the ceremonies appears to be anything but a myth.
For years J. P. McNu1ty, in charge of the mines
has been complaining that Indians stole the turquoise by night, especially on moonlight nights, but
it was an extremely difficult task to get proofs.

An interview with one of the arrested Indians was reported as

follows in the same article:

. . .'My name in is Marcial Quintana,‘ said the Indian.
‘I live at Cochiti. I go to Turquoise mines to get

turquoise,that is true enough. We want turquoise{
Indians from Santo Domingo bring us turquoise to
Cochiti, that is true enough, but they ask big price
for it. We hear this mine was openyand nobody watched
it or canaabout it. We see sheriffs coming but not
try to escape. We think we can get turquoise from

mine which nobody watched.’

Asked if he thought that the Tiffanies had grown
indifferent about their turquoise mines and were
willing to let the Indians remove the stones,
Quintana said that he did not think that the
Tiffanies or anybody else cared if they went to the
mine where they were captured.

An article in the New Mexican for March l0, 1911, reports that

the Cochiti Indians were sentenced to nine months in the Penitentiary

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 306 343

for stealing turquoise. The -.iicle further stated (pl. ex. 20):

The Indians use tr qaoisc for ceremonial purposes
and it has been practically iwpossibla to get them to
understand that the turquoise mines are no longer
public property.

The Indians of both Cochiti and Santo Domingo were
cautioned by Superintendent Crandall to keep away from
the Tiffany mines but their fondness for the semiprecious stone got them finally into trouble.

The Tiffany mines have been closed down for some
time in order to curtail the production. These mines
near Santa Fe had supplied all the American turquoise
the Tiffanys use in their famous jewelry.

Joseph E. Pogue, in his study entitled The Turquoise, 3 Memoirs

of the National Academy of Science 52, fn. 6 (1915), wrote:

For a long period the Queres of San Felipe were
the chief traders in the Cerrillos product.

The Commission finds from a preponderance of the evidence that
the Santo Domingo Indians had sole and exclusive use and occupancy
of the turquoise mines in the claimed area at the beginning of the
American period and for a long time prior thereto. The Comission
further finds that such use and occupancy continued on a sole and
exclusive basis until 1879 and on a non-exclusive basis for a long time
thereafter. '

30. Other Santo Domingo Use of Claimed Area. Both turquoise

mining zones are Santo Domingo religious shrines. Tr. 1953 at 26,

23; Tf- 1954 at 53- The mining zones were also within the Santo

Domingo traditional horse pasture, which continued to be used until

42 Ind. C1. Com. 306 344

the late 1930's. Tr. 1953 at 35, Tr. 1954 at 21. Plaintiff's exhibit

number 2, a map placed in evidence during the 1954 proceedings, shows
both zones within the pueblo's customary use area, and approximates
the eastern boundary shown on joint exhibit No. 1, the map prepared
by the Bureau of Land Management for the 1977 trial.
Conclusion of Law

Based upon the foregoing findings of fact, Nos. 23 through 30,
the Commission concludes that the area described in finding 24, above,
lying to the east of the aboriginal title area heretofore found to
belong to the Pueblo of Santo Domingo, was also owned by the Pueblo of
Santo Domingo under aboriginal title at the beginning of American

sovereignty over New Mexico and for an undetermined time thereafter.
