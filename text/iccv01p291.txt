STAGE E;-EJT

On motion of the defendant in the above—entitled actions, to which
the petitioners in said actions consented, the said cases were consoliw
dated for the purposes of trial, and the evidence offered at the hearing
before the Commission was submitted by and on behalf of both petitioners;
likewise, the evidence offered by the defendant was made applicable to
both cases. While the order permitting the consolidation also permitted
separate briefs and separate requests for findings of fact, the petitioners filed a joint request for findings of fact but filed separate
briefs. Therefore, the Commission‘s findings of fact hereinafter set

forth will apply to both cases.

_ 2 FINDINGS OF FACT
The Commission makes the following findings of fact in Docket No. 16,
wherein the Choctaw Nation is petitioner, and No. 23, in which the Chickasaw Nation is petitioner, and in both of which the United States of

’Anerica‘is defendant:1. On the 18th day of October, 1820 (7 Stat. 210), the Choctaw
Nation of Indians and the United States concluded a treaty at "Doak‘s
Stand," by which the United States ceded to said Choctaw Nation of
Indians a tract of land lying west of the Mississippi River in what is
now the States of Arkansas and Oklahoma, and westward, within the follow»
ing boundaries:

“Beginning on the Arkansas River, where the lower

boundary line of the Cherokee strikes the same; thence

up the Arkansas to the Canadian Fork, and up the same to

its source; thence due South to the Red River; thence

down Red River, three miles below the mouth of Little

River, which empties itself into Red River on the north

side; thence a direct line to the beginning."
that said treaty became known as that of "boakis Stand.“

2. On the 20th day of January, 1825 (7 Stat. 23%), a treaty was
made between the United States and the Choctaw Ration for the purpose
of definitely determining the eastern boundary line of the cession of
1820, and it was fixed to conform approximately to the western boundary
of the Territory (new State) of Arkansas, and the Choctaw ceded to the
United States all of its territory east of that line.

3. On September 27, 1830 (7 Stat. 333) the United States and the

Choctaw Nation made another treaty in which it was stipulated "that this

il.Ind. c1. comm. 291 ?93
' -3...

may be the treaty existing between the parties. .All other Treaties here~
tofore existing and inconsistent with the provisions of this are hereby
declared null and void," and.Articlo II of said treaty provided for a
Special Presidential grant to the Choctaw, as follows:

“The'United States under a grant specially to be made
by the President of the U}S. shall cause to be conveyed to
the Choctaw Nation a tract of country west of the Mississippi River, in fee Simple to then and their descendants,
to inure to then while they shall exist as a nation and
live on it, beginning near Fort Smith where the Arkansas
boundary crosses the.Arkansas River, running thence to the
source of the Canadian Fork; if in the limits of the United
States, or to those limits; thence due south to Red River,
and down.Red River to the west boundary of the Territory of
Arkansas; thence north along that line to the beginning.
The boundary of the same to be agreeably to the Treaty made
and concluded at Washington City in the year 1825. The
grant to be executed so soon as the present Treaty shall be
ratified." I

The boundary of the territory described in said Article II differs from
that in said treaty of 1820 in that it fixed the western boundary of the
cession at the 100th meridian west longitude, but the land involved in
this proceeding was included in the area described in said.Article II
and in the patent hereafter referred to.

Pursuant to the requirements of said Article II, the United States
issued its patent for the lands last above described, on March 23, 18MB,
which patent reads as follows:

"Whereas, by the second article of the treaty began and

held at Dancing Rabbit creek on the fifteenth day of September,

in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty

(as ratified by the Senate of the United States on the 2Uth

day of February, 1831), by the commissioners on the part of

the United States, and the ningoes, chiefs, captains, and
warriors of the Choctaw nation, on the part of said nation,

'\- it is provided that ‘the United States, under a grant

Fort Smith, where the Arkansas Boundary crosses the nrkansas
river, running thence to the source of the Canadian fork,

if in the limits of the United States, or to those limits;
thence due south to Red river, and down Red river to the
west boundary of the territory of Arkansas; thence north
along that line to the beginning, the boundary of the same
to be agreeably to the treaty made and concluded at washington
city in the year 1825:

"Now, know ye that the United States of nnerica, in consideration of the premises, and in execution of the agreement
and stipulation in the aforesaid treaty, have given and granted,
and by these presents do give and grant, unto the said Choctaw
nation the aforesaid ‘tract of country west of the Mississippi;'
to have and to hold the sane, with all the rights, privileges,
immunities, and appurtenances of whatsoever nature thereto
belonging, as intended ‘to be conveyed‘ by the aforesaid
article, ‘in fee simple to then and their descendants, to
inure to them, while they shall exist as a nation and live on
it,‘ liable to no transfer or alienation, except to the United
States, or with their consent.

"In testimony whereof, I, John Tyler, president of the

United States of America, have caused these letters to be

made patent, and seal of the general land office to be hereunto affixed. Given under my hand, at the city of Washington,

the twentyuthird day of March, in the year of our Lord one

thousand eight hundred and forty—two, and of the independence

3. In 1837, by an agreement dated January 17, 1837 (ll Stat. 573)
the Choctaw and Chickasaw united, and for a consideration of $530,000
the Choctaw gzanted the Chickasaw the privilege of occupying and hold»
ing in common with the Choctaw the area of the Choctaw country lying
east of the hundredth meridian west longitude. The boundaries of the

Chickasaw district, created by said Treaty, were changed by an agreement between said Indians, dated November 11, 1851: (10 Stat. 1116), but

1 Ind: c1. cos. 291 * L. i95
o-5.it was not until the agreement between the United States and the Chociaw and Chibkasaw Nations of Indians, dated June 22, 1855 (11 Stat. 611),
that the respective rights of the two Indian nations in the territory

they jointly owned were definitely settled, and it was therein stipulated as follows:

“Article 1. The following shall constitute and remain
the boundaries of the Choctaw and Chickasaw country, viz:
Beginning at a point on the Arkansas River, one hundred
paces east of old Fort Smith, where the western boundaryline of the State of drkansas crosses the said river, and
running thence due south to Red River; thence up Red River
to the point where the meridian of one hundred degrees west
-longitude crosses the same; thence north along said meridian
to the main Canadian River; thence down said river to its
Junction with the nrkansas River; thence down said river to

the place of beginning.

hand pursuant to an act of Congress approved May 28, 1830,
the United States do hereby forever secure and guarantee the
lands embraced within the said limits, to the members of the
Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes, their heirs and successors, to
be held in common; so that each and every member of either
tribe shall have an equal, undivided interest in the whole:
Provided, however, No part thereof shall ever be sold without
the consent of both tribes, and that said land shall revert
to the United States if said Indians and their heirs become
extinct or abandon the sane.

“Article 2. ‘A district for the Chickasaw is hereby established, bounded as follows, to wit: Beginning on the north
bank of Red River, at the mouth of Island Bayou, where it
empties into Red River, about twenty~six miles in a straight
line, below the mouth of False Wachitta; thence running a
northwesterly course, along the main channel of said bayou,
to the Junction of the three prongs of said bayou, nearest ,
the dividing ridge between Wachitta and Low Blue Rivers, as
laid down on Capt, R, L. Hunter's map; thence northerly along
the eastern prong of Island Bayou to its source; hence due
north to the Canadian River; thence west along the main
Canadian to the ninety-eighth degree of west longitude;
thence south to Red River; and thence down Red River to the

from the eastern source of Island Bayou, to the main Canadian shall not include Allen's or Wa~pa—nacka Academy, within the Chickasaw District, then, an offset shall be made from
said line so as to leave said academy two miles within the
Chickasaw district, north, west and south from the lines of
boundary,

"Article 3. The remainder of the country held in common
by the Choctaws and Chickasaws, shall constitute the Choctaw
district, and their officers and people shall at all times
have the right of safe conduct and free passage through the
Chickasaw district." S

5. And by said agreement of June 22, 1855 (ll Stat. 611) referred
to in Finding Ho. H, the parties thereto further stipulated as follows:

"Article 9. The Choctaw Indians do hereby absolutely and
forever quitwclaim and relinquish to the United States all
their right, title and interest in, and to any and all lands,
west of the one hundredth degree of west longitude; and the
Chectaws and Chickasaws do hereby lease to the United States
all that portion of their common territory west of the ninetyeighth degree of west longitude, for the permanent settlement
of the Wichita and such other tribes or bands of Indians as
the Government may desire to locate therein; excluding, however,
all the Indians of How Mexico, and also those whose usual
ranges at present are north of the nrkansas River, and whose
permanent locations are north of the Canadian River, but including those bands whose permanent ranges are south of the
Canadian, or between it and the Arkansas; which Indians shall
be subject to the exclusive control of the United States,
under such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with the
rights and interests of the Choctaws and Chichasaws, as may
from time to time be prescribed by the President for their
government: Provided, however, The territory so leased shall
remain open to settlement by Chectaws and Chickasaws as heretofore. C

Farticlo 10. In consideration of the foregoing relinquishment and lease, and as soon as practicable after the ratification of this convention, the'United States will pay to the
Choctaws the sum of six hundred thousand dollars, and to the
Chickasaws the sun of two hundred thousand dollars, in such
manner as their general councils shall respectively direct.

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 291   - 7 -i 297

Qarticle 21. This convention shall supersede and take

the place of all former treaties between the United States

and the Choctaws, and also, of all treaty stipulations between the United States and the Chickasaws, and between the

Choctaws and Chickasaws, inconsistent with this agreement,

and shall take effect and be obligatory upon the contracting parties, from the date hereof, whenever the same shall

be ratified by the respective councils of the Choctaw and

Chickasaw tribes, and by the President and Senate of the

United States."

Said treaty was duly ratified, and, pursuant to the terms thereof, the
United States paid the Choctaws $600,000 and the Chickasaws $200,000
and acquired a perpetual lease on the lands of the two nations lying
between the 98th and 100th meridians. Reduced to a price per acre, the
tribes were paid 10.3717 cents per acre.

The territory of the Choctaw and Chickasaw lying between the 98th
and 100th meridians, west longitude, was owned in common by the two
tribes and became known as the "Leased District." It comprised about
7,713,620 acres, based on the aggregate acreage of the four reserves
in the Leased District, and not the figure 7,7i3,239 acres commonly

Used. The Choctaw Nation was the owner of a three-fourths interest and

the Chickasaw Nation was the owner of a one—fourth.interest of said

-' Leased District.

6. On the 28th day of April, 1866 (lh Stat. 769). the United
States and the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations concluded a treaty (which
was ratified by the United States Senate and proclaimed by the President in 1866), containing the following provisions;

Qarticle 2. The Choctawe and Chickasaws hereby covenant and agree that henceforth neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, otherwise than in punishment of crime

interest not less than five per cent in trust for the said
nations, until the legislatures of the Choctaw and Chickasaw
Nations respectively shall have nade such laws, rules, and
regulations as.nay be necessary to give all persons of African
descent, resident in the said nation at the date of the treaty
of Fort Smith, and their descendants, heretofore held in slavery
among said nations, all the rights, privileges, and immunities,
including the right of suffrage, of citizens of said nations,
except in the annuities, moneys, and public domain claimed by,
or belonging to, said nations respectively; and also to give
to such persons who were residents as aforesaid, and their descendants, forty acres each of the land of said nations on the.
same terms as the Choctaws and Chickasaws, to be selected on
the survey of said land, after the Choctaws and Chickasaws
and Kansas Indians have made their selections as herein provided; and innediately on the enactment of such laws, rules,
and regulations, the said sun of three hundred thousand

regulations not be made by the legislatures of the said nations
respectively, within two years from the ratification of this
treaty, then the said sun of three hundred thousand dollars
shall cease to be held in trust for the said Choctaw and
Chickasaw Nations, and be heLd for the use and benefit of such

remove from the said Territory in such manner as the United
States shall deem proper,~—the United States agreeing, withw
in ninety days from the expiration of the said two years, to
remove from said nations all such persons of African descent
as may be willing to remove; those remaining or returning

among them, the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand
dollars shall be advanced and paid to the Choctaws, and
fifty thousand dollars to the Chickasaws, through their
respective treasurers, as soon as practicable after the
ratification of this treaty, to be repaid out of said
moneys or any other moneys of said nations in the hands

of the United States; the residue, not affected by any
provisions of this treaty, to remain in the Treasury of

the United States at an annual interest of five per cent.,

advance the welfare and happiness of said nations and their

people respectively.

Warticle 51, It is further agreed that all treaties and
parts of treaties inconsistent herewith be, and the same are
_ hereby, declared null and void."

"As required by the provisions of said Article M6, the United States

paid to the Choctaw the sum of $150,000 and to the Chickasaw the.sum of

- $50,000; however, by order nade by the Court of Claims in the case

No; K-331:, Chickasaw Nation v. United States and the Czgoctaw Nation (103
Ct. C15. 57). the amount paid the Chickasaw Nation pursuant to said
Article 36, was allowed as a counter—clain of the Government because the
Chickasaw were not entitled to the payment when made, so no part of the
consideration mentioned in said treaty enured to the benefit of the

Chickasaw Nation.

7. After the conclusion of the treaty of April 28, 1866, the United
States located the Cheyennes and arapahoes on 2,389,159 acres of the
Leased District, and by Section 15 of the Indian Appropriation not of
March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 989) there was appropriated and paid to the

Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations the sum of $2,99l,N50 (less $M8,800 deducted

1 lndl c1. Comm. 291 _ _r1o _ I C 300

by Resolution of January 18, 1893, 27 Stat. 753) for the "right, title,
interest and claim” of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations in 2,393,160
acres of the lands occupied by the Cheyenne and Arapahoes, the remaining
;portion having been allotted to individual Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indians.
This area is not involved in this claim, so deducting the said acreage
of 2,h89,l59 from the area of the Leased District, there remains the
tracts which are involved in this case and which are referred to in Finding No. 8, following.

8. The Leased District reaaining after deducting the Cheyenne and
.Arapahoe reserve, was divided as follows: C

Greer County

Greer County embraced 1,511,952 acres of the Leased District, and
‘until March 16, 1896, when the Supreme Court decided otherwise, the
county was claimed as a part of the State of Texas, (162 U.S. 1). The
defendant received for the lands it sold the sum or $365,9h1.7h, but by
the Acts of January 18, 1897 (29 Stat, n90) and March 1, 1899 (30 stat;
966). occupants of land in the county and purchasers of such land from
Texas, prior to March l6,'l896, were given the right to perfect title
thereto under the homestead laws by paying only the land office fees,
and.under said.Act of January 18, 1897, four sections in every town»
ship were reserved for the Territory of Oklahoma, so the United States
did not receive any consideration for a very large part of the lands
in said county, C

No Indians were located in Greer County.

v , twichita Reserve .
The Wichita and aifiliated bands of Indians were located on
0 793,610 acres of the Leased District. ‘Under the so~ca1led Jerome Agreeiment of June H, 1891 (28 Stat. 895), the defendant allotted to the
Wichita and affiliated bands 169,600 acres of their reserve and sold the
remainder, 5TH,010 acres, for the sum of $358,996.63. The sales of the
, Wichita lands began in 190% but all the lands were not disyosed of until
1925; however, the major part thereof was sold during the first six years
after the sales began, .
Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Reserve
‘The Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Indians were located on 2,968,893
acres of the Leased District by two treaties of October 21, 1867 (15 Stat.
581; 15 Stat. 589). or this area, 5u5,ooo acres were allotted to the
Indians and 10,310 acres were reserved for school, agency, religious and
other purposes, making a total of 555,310 acres retained by, or for the
benefit of, the three tribes. Of the lands not allotted to Indians,
reserved for schools, agency, religious or other purposes, or granted
to the State of Oklahoma, the defendant sold some 2,187,630 acres of the
9 reserve for a total sum of $7,123,959.55. The sales of these lands did
not start until after August 6, 1901 when some 1,807,630 acres of the
area were sold for aperoximately $2,259,959.55, and beginning about 1905,
380,000 acres of the 480,000 (known as the Big Pasture) reserved by the

Indians under the agreement of October 6, 1892, ratified Juno 6, 1900

i (31 stat. 676), were sold for $u,esu,u17.o5.

1 Ind. c1. Comm. 291 302

9: To summarize. the defendant obtained under the treaty of 1865
(aside from the Cheyenne and Arapahoe reserve, allotments, agency and
school reserves, etc.). a total acreage in the Leased District of

u,u99,551, computed as follows:

All of Greer County . _ 1.511.958 acres

10. ‘The defendant obtained, by the treaty of 1866, the reversionary
interests of the petitioners in the Leased District. This enabled the
defendant to place Indians in the District without regard to the restrictive provisions of the lease (Art. . Treaty of 1855), which excluded

certain Indians from permanent settlement in the Leased District, and it
restored the fee title. thus giving the defendant complete control over
the lands and the unrestricted right to dispose of any part or all thereof, as it did in selling the surplus land. that is, land not needed for
the Indian groups located in the Leased District, and granting large
tracts thereof to Oklahoma. A

11. That the value of said u,u99,551 acres. obtained by the defend»
ant under the treaty of 1866. was, at the date of said treaty, April 28.

1866. the sum of $h.h99,55l, in which the Choctaw had a three—feurths

1 Ind. Cl. Comm. 291 303

interest and the Chickasaw a one-fourth interest. On an acreage basis,
the Choctaw owned 3,37N,663 acres and the Chickasaw 1,129,888 acres of the
total of U,H99,55l. for the perpetual lease on this land (at 10.3717
cents per acre) the Choctaw received $350,009.92 and the Chickasaw
‘ $116,670.01 and deducting said Last stated two sums from the sum of
$9,h99,55l, there remains the sum of $9,032,659 which is the value of the
reversionary interest of the two tribes in the land involved in this case.
Therefore, deducting from $3,37U,663 (value of Choctaw Interest in the
part of the Leased District here involved), the said sum $350,009.92 and
the sum of $87,7h1 (proportion of $150,000 paid the Choctaw for lands hero
involved) received by the Choctaw under the 1866 treaty, he Choctaw are
entitled to recover the sum of $2,936,913; and deducting from the sun of
$1,123,888 (value of Chickasaw interest in part of the Leased District
here involved), said sum of $116,670.01, the Chickasaw are entitled to
recover the sun of $1,008,218.
