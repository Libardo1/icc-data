OPINION OF THE COMMISSIOH
oiuarr, Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.

-I

This claim comes before the Commission a second time. The first
or original petition was filed herein on.April 26, 1950, and thereafter, and on.$uIy 25, 1950, defendant filed its motion for summary
judgment based upon the ground that the same case had been previously
adjudicated on its merits by the Court of Claims in case No. J-31 and

that its order of December M, l933, therein barred relitigation of the

case before this Commission. The Commission by its order of.April 27,

order of April 27, 1951. °‘

Pursuant to the order of June 22, 1951, the plaintiff, on July 18,
1951, filed its amended petition and defendant thereafter filed its
motion for summary judgment based upon the same ground as the first
motion mentioned above. So the case is now before us on the amended
petition, and the question to be determined is the effect of the former
Judgent of the Court of claims in the case, The Assiniboine Indian
Tribe v. United States, 3-31, 77 c. Cls. 3&7, it being conceded by both
sides that the parties inlthe former case are the same as those now before this Commission and that in the former case. compensation was sought
for the identical land which is involved here and for which compensation
is again prayed for.

Inasmich as a determination of the question raised depends upon
the!issues before the Court of Claims in the former case and the cause
of action pleaded in the amended petition in the present case, we shall

set forth as briefly as possible the issues presented to and decided

by the Court of claims and those shown by the amended petition herein.

CASE BEFCE COURT OF CLAIMS
We shall first look at the Court of Claims determination of the
case, Assiniboine Indian Tribe v. United States, No. J-3l, ‘[7 C. C15.
3147, which defendant pleads as a bar to our consideration of the pending

claim. The Court of Claims, after fixing the damages at $3,238,970

and determining that the offsets exceed that sum, made its final order

in that case as follows:

"At a Court of Claims held. in the City of Washington
on the 14th day of December, A. D., 1933, judgment was ordered
to be entered as follows:

"Upon the special findings of fact , which are made
part of the judgment herein, the Court decides, as a conclusion of law, that plaintiff is not entitled to recover,
and its petition is therefore dismissed.”

This order does not appear in the published reports of the Court of

Claims. The original order was made on April 10, 1933, and the order

A quoted above followed an amendment of the findings of fact and therefore seems to be the last order determining the- case. Anyway, the two

orders, except as to dates, are identical.

The former case was for damages for the appropriation by defendant

of a large area of land including the land involved in the claim here

under consideration. The petition in that case (Amended and Supplemental Petition filed in Court of Claims on July 23, 1930) alleges that

the Assiniboine Indian Tribe by virtue of the treaty of Fort Iaramie
of September 17, ‘l85l,- ll Stat. 7149, acquired the right and title to
the exclusive use and occugcy of- the following described tract of
land:

commencing at the mouth of the Yellowstone River, thence
up the Missouri River to the month of the I-hisselshell River;
thence from the mouth of the hilssellshell River, following a
direct line in a southeasterly direction to the mouth of the
Powder River; thence down the Yellowstone River to the place
of beginning. (Par. 8)

This description is substantially the same as that contained in Article

5 of the Fort Iaramie treaty, and by its Finding No. VIII, the com.

of Claims found the area to contain 6,1-I»'(7,91-‘.0 acres of land of the value

plaintiff herein alleges (par. VI) that it acquired the same land
under the same treaty and had the full and exclusive use and occupancy er same until taken by defendant.
As to theappropriation of the above-described lands, which will
hereafter be referred to as the Fort Laramie lands, the manner in

which they were taken will now be shown .

 

m:ac:rzI*m oznmz or AUGUST l8 1363
In the former case it was alleged (pars. l8, 19) that defendant,
without the consent of plaintiff and notx-rithstandin,_‘=:; the stipulations‘
of the Fort Laramie treaty, through the Executive Order of :Bng=_',ust 13,
1868, established a military reservation for the use of defendant on
the following lands:
“The initial point is at the intersection of the 101!-°
of ,longitude, west from Greenwich with the forty-eighth
parallel of north latitude, thence mn south fifteen miles,

thence east fifteen miles, thence north thirty miles, thence

rwest thirty miles, thence south thirty miles, thence east
fifteen miles.“

which military reserve unlawfully deprived plaintiff of about l50,000
acres of its Fort Iaramie lands of the value of $137,500 and without
compensating the Indians therefor. i

The court of Claims found (Finding I?) that a military reservation
was set apart by said Executive Order of August 18, 1868, and included
169,571; acres of the Fort laramie land.

In its amended petition (par. IX) plaintiff sets forth a like
claim for the same lands &en for the military reserve by said 3ecutive Order and alleges the value thereof to be $295,058 .76, which

-5

|‘,
s\.L..{-.J&-1-Os -I 30-!

sum, plus interest from date of taking, is said to represent the damages

sustained by plaintiff, and claim is made therefor. It is also alleged

that by act of congress, dated May.l9, 1900 , these lands were made subject to disposal under the Homestead, Totrnsite and Desert Land laws.

szsoosxvs ososns OF.APBIL 13 1875 .AED JULY 13 1880

 

In the former case the plaintiff pleaded (pars. 27, 29) that by
the Executive Order of April 13, 1875, without the consent of plaintiff
and in violation of the stipulations of the treaty of l85l, and without compensation, defendant unlawfully deprived the Assiniboine of the
following described part of their Fort Iaramie lands and added them to

the reservation of the Gros Ventre, Piegan, Blood’, Blackfeet and Grow

Indians , to-t-ri t:

‘Commencing at a point 1.-ioere a straight line drawn
from the mouth of the I-tusselshell River to the mouth of
the Powder River intersects the 1:70 parallel of north

latitude; thence east with the said parallel to the south
bank of the Yellowstone River, thence down and with the
south bank of said river to the south boundary of the
military reservation at Fort Buford; thence west along

¥ the south boundary of said military reservation to its
western boundary; thence north along said western boundary to the south ban}: of the Missouri River; thence up and
with the south bank of said river to the mouth of the

Mussels.hell River; thence along the straight line drawn

between the mouth of the I-iusselshell River to the mouth
of the Powder River to the place of beginning.“

And that said lands were appropriated to the use and benefit of defendant
and consisted of about 6,500,000 acres of the value of $19,500,000.

sue Court of Claims found (siuiiug VII) that the order included
all the lands granted plaintiff by the Fort Laramie treaty except the
portion lying south of the 1-Wth parallel and that set apart for the

military reserve. That court having in other findings found there were

169 ,5?‘-1» acres in the military reserve (Finding Iv), and 3-£55,870 acres
(Finding VIII) lying south of the 1l»'{th parallel, the part set over to
the other Indians by the Executive order of April 13, 1875, would comprise 5,81l~2,3-L96 acres.

And it is pleaded in the former case (pars. 30, 31, 32) that pursuant to the Executive order of July 13, 1880, there was u:L'|.av.-zfully
taken from plaintiff, without plaintiff‘ s consent, the following described part of the Fort Iaranie lands:

Beginning at a point where the south boundary of the
Fort Buford military reserve intersects the right w of

the Yellowstone River; thence according to the true meridian west along the south ‘boundary of said military reserve to its western boundary; thence continuing west to
the right bank of the Missouri River; thence up and along
said right bani-C, with the meanders thereof to the middle
of the main channel of the Musselshell River; thence along
a straight line drawn between the mouth of the Musselshell
River and the mouth of the Powder River to its intersection
with the 347° parallel of north latitude; thence east along
said para.1.1el to its intersection with the right E of
the Yellowstone River; thence down and along said right

bank, with the meanders thereof, to the place of beginning.
which area was alleged to comprise about 5,000,000 acres of the value
of about $l5,000;000. And it is alleged therein that that area was
appropriated by the United States to satisfy land grants to railroads,
or was thrown open to public entry and settlement.

With respect to the area covered by this Executive order (1880) ,
the Court of Claims found (Finding VIII) that the greater portion of
the land set apart by the April 13, l8?5 Executive order, being the
part lying south of the south line, extended, of the military reserve,

and north of the 347th @allel, was opened to public entry. And in the

same finding  court found that the part of the Fort Laramie land

lying south.of the h7th parallel comprised h65,87O acres which were not
included in either the 1875 or 1880 Executive Orders; also, that no
formal order was issued placing this area in the public domain and that
there was no record of the disposition thereof, except that between

August l9, 1882 and October l#, 191% plats of surveys of these lands

3

were filed in the General Land Office. And that by the orders and proceedings above described all of the land granted the Indians by the
Fort Laramie Treaty was appropriated by the Government.

In the amended petition_in the pending case there is set forth
(par. X) the lands described in the Executive Orders of 1875 and l880,
as in the former case, and it is alleged that all thereof, amounting
to 3,5Th,992 acres lying north of the k7th parallel, were taken by
virtue of said Executive Orders of 1875 and l880, and that those lands,
and the lands lying south.of the h7th parallel, h55,87O acres, were
taken without compensation for public use and disposed of under the
public land laws of the United States. It is further alleged that the
value of these lands at the time of taking was $7,191,u1u.

.As to the remaining Fort Laramie lands, that is, 2,267,50h acres
not disposed of as above set forth, the plaintiff now alleges (par.
VIII) that by act of July 2, 186%, 13 Stat. 365, Congress granted Fort
Laramie lands to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company, and it is
charged that “as a result of this statute and the construction of the

ilroad, the United States took approximately 2,267,§Ok of plaintiff’s
Fort Laramie Treaty lands for public use without compensation or consideration of any kind, and conferred title to such.acreage on the

Northern Pacific Railroad Co.” .and that such lands when so taken were

of the value of $1#,l91€-,822.1I-0, which amount, with interest from time
of ta.1::'Lng, they claim as damages.

In this way plaintiff now accounts for allthe la.n.ds involved in
the Executive orders of 1875 and 1880 and the area lying south of the
147th parallel, the only difference between the determination of the

Court of claims and the allegations of the amended petition herein is

n as to the acreage which was restored to the public domain and the acreage obtained by the railroad, the court deciding that all (without
specifying the acreage) was so disposed of .

An examination of the act of July 2, 1361; will show that only the
fee to the lands granted by that act passed to the railroad and that
Indian title, that is, the right of occupancy, remained in the tribe,
for it is provided therein:

‘The United States shall eztingzish as rapidly as
may be consistent with public policy and the welfare of
said Indians, the Indian title to all lands falling under
the operation of this act, and acquired in the donation
to the (road) named in this Bill.‘

!
This act was construed in the case, Buttz v. Northern Pacific Railroad
Company, 119 ms. 55, 30 L. ed. 331;, wherein the Supreme Court said:

At ‘the time the Act of July 2, 186%, was passed, the
title of the Indian Tribes was not extinguished. But that
fact did not prevent the grant of Congress from operating
to pass the fee of the lend to the Company. The fee was
in the United States. The Indians had merely a right of
occupancy, a right to use the land subject to the dominion
and control of the government . The grant conveyed the fee
subject to this right of occupancy. The Railroad Company
took the property with this incumbrance. The right of the
Indians, it is true, could not be interfered with or determined except by the United States. No private individual
could invade it, and the manner, time, and conditions of its
eztingciishment were mtters solely for the consideration of

the government, and are not open to ccntestation in the
Judicial tribunals. o

In the grant to the Railroad Company now before us,

Congress was not unmindful of the title of the Indians to

the lands granted, and it stipulated for its extinguishment by the United States as rapidly as might be consistent

with public policy and the welfare of the Indians.
See United States v. Santa Fe, 311'. 13.5. 339, 86 1.. ed. 260.
g It is evident, therefore, that the Assiniboine lost no part of
their lands by the railroad. grant, for it only operated on the Fort
Iaramie lands when the Indian title thereto, that is, the right of
occupancy, which is the onlytitle they ever had, had been extinguished
by defendant, and that was done, as shown above, by Executive or administrative action. In truth, no @1: of the lands lying north of
the 1F{th parallel was taken from plaintiff for restoration to the public ,
domain or to satisfy the railroad grant because those lands had been
set over to other Indians by the kecutive Order of 1875 and it was
not until the Ihzecutive Order of 1880 that Indian title was extinguished
and those lands became part of the public domin or made fully operative
the railroad grant.

ire have set forth above somewhat in detail the claim asserted in
the former case, the action of the Court of Claims thereon, and the
pleaded claim in the pending case, to show that the claim not»: asserted
is the same as that submitted and adjudicated in the former case. In
the former case, as we have shown above, the plaintiff sued for the
appropriation by defendant of the lands it acquired by the Fort Laramie
treaty; it alleged, and the court found (1) that it had Indian title

to those lands, (2) that the lands were appropriated by defendant, without the consent of the Indians, and without compensation, by the Executive

Orders of 1868, 1875, 1880, as to their lands lying north of the 1:71;};

parallel, and by administrative action as to their lands lying south
of said parallel, and (3) that the lands so appropriated were of the

value of $3,238,970 at the time of their appropriation, for which amount judgment was awarded.

As to the manner by which defendant appropriated the Fort Laramie
lands, the Court of Claims, at page 371 of its opinion, made it very

plain that they were taken by the executive and administrative action

Just referred to, for it said:

When the Fort Bu.'t‘ord Military Reservation was established by the Executive order of August l8, l868, a.
part of the Fort Laramie lands in the northeast corner
thereof was taken thereby. Of the area set apart to
this military reservation, about l63,l25 [J_.69,57£L7 acres
lay south of the Missouri River and within the lands
ceded to the Assiniboine Nation by the Fort Laramie
Treaty. On April l3, 1875, an Executive order was
entered by which the greater portion of the tract ceded
to plaintiff by the Fort Laramie Treaty was, in the
terms of the order, "withdrawn from sale, and set apart
as an addition to the present reservation of the Gros
Ventre, Piegan, Blood, Blackfeet, and Grow Indians ,8
and of the land included in this order about 5 ,865,990
acres lay within the boundaries of the land heretofore
ceded by the Fort Laramie Treaty to the Assiniboines.
The land thatwas taken for the Fort Buford Reservation
and by the Executive order of April 13, l8'{5, included
(with more) all of the land granted to_ the plaintiff by
the Fort Laramie Treaty except a comparatively szall
portion south of the forty-seventh parallel. In July
1880, by an Executive order a part of the area affected
by the Executive order of Ayil 13, l8T5,.wa.s restored
to the public domain, and later and about 1882, the
defendant surveyed and filed plats of the portion of
the Fort Iaramie land. south of the forty-seventh parallel
and thereafter either opened the land to settlement or
donated; it to the Northern Pacific Railroad. In this
way the Government disposed of all of the land granted

a.’ *4to lain.:.:.. by the Fort Laramie Treaty.
(Underscoring supplied)

 

It is quite plain that the claim stated in the amended petition

before us is the identical claim pleaded and adjudicated in the former

case. Ehe parties are the same, the land involved is identical, the

appropriations thereof by defendant were in the same manner as detezmined by the Court of Claims, and the relief sought is the same,

namely, damages measured by the value of the land at the time taken.

And it is equally plain that the Court of Claims determined in the
former case all issues now pleaded in favor of the plaintiff, particularly, ownership of the land, unlawful appropriation thereof, and the
damages resulting therefrom. True, plaintiff now claims interest, socalled, in addition to the value, ‘out the allegations, respect@ interest do not create a different cmise of action because such demand has
to do with the measure of relief (Green v. Bogue, 158 U.S. #78, 39 L.
ed. 1061), and, as will be shown, would attach automatically to an
award for damages for property taken in eminent domin, whether pleaded
or not. Nor do the allegations that the Fort Iaramie lands were dis!

posed of under the various land laws create a different cause of action,

for they plead that they were appropriated by the same executive and

administrative action as pleaded and determined in the former case.
Had the subsequent disposal thereof under the land laws been considered
a controlling fact, it could and should have been brought forward in
the former case, for the Court of Claims and the plaintiff were well
aware of such disposals since it was pleaded and determined that the
lands not granted to the railroad became mrt of the public domain and
‘were thereby thrown open to public entry and settlement-—so we must

assume such disposals were before the court and considered by it.

‘The most that can be said to distinguish the two claims is that

by the second, the one now pending, plaintiff asks for more compensation for the lands lost by administrative and executive action.

parties upon a different claim or cause of action. In the
former case, the judgent, if rendered upon the merits,
constitutes an absolute bar to a subsequent action. It

is a finality as to the claim or demand in controversy,
concluding parties and those inprivity with them, not
only as to every mtter which was offered. and received

to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any
other admissible matter which might have been offered

for that purpose. * "' " The language, therefore, which

is so often used, that a judgient estops not only as to
every ground of recovery or defense actually presented

in the action, but also as to every ground which might
have been presented, is strictly accurate, when applied

to the denand or claim in controversy. Such demand or
claim, having passed into Judgnent, cannot again be
brought into litigation between the parties in proce$.ngs
at law, upon any ground whatever.

But where the second action between the same parties
is upon a different claim or’ demnd, the judgent in the
prior action operates as an estoppel only as to those
matters in issue or points controverted, upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered. In
all cases, therefore, where it is sought to apply the
estoppel of a judgment rendered upon one cause of action
to matters arising in a suit upon a different cause of
action, the inquiry mst always be as to the point or
question actually litigated and determined in the original
action; not what might have been thns litigated and determined. Only upon such matters is the judgment conclusive
in another action. a

To the same effect is Commissioner v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 92 L. ed.
898, and many other cases decided by the Supreme court and the court

of Claims. Therefore, since the present case as pleaded is the identical

Court of Claims is a bar to our reconsidering it now, that is, it
comes within the first branch.of the rule quoted above. See, also,
Southern Pacific Railroad Co. v. United States, l6S'U.S. 1, M8, #2

ed. 262, 26%.

To overcome the bar of the former judgment, counsel for the Indians devoted much space in their brief, and time in their oral argument,
to the proposition that subsequent to the.Assiniboine decision there
have been decisions of the Court of Claims creating an altered situation, and state in their brief “the Court of Claims was still of the
opinion on March l3, l933, in rendering the decision in the Creek
Nation case that interest was not to be included as a part of just

compensation in Indian cases even though the Indian.tribe had fee

simple title.’ We find no support for this assertion, for five years

before the Creek decision the court allowed interest as a part of just
compensation (see Yankton Siouzrv. U; 3., 65 C. Cls. M27, decided
April l6, l92S) in an Indian case. Anyway, the cases relied upon as
showing an “altered situation" do not support plaintiff's proposition.

As a matter of law, this court in ordinary just compen' sation cases prior to the decision of the Supreme Court in
the Seaboard Air Line case was of the opinion that under
section l'[7 of the Judicial Code interest could not be included in the judgment. The Seaboard.Air Line case, 261
U.S. 299, was decided by the Supreme Court I~1arcH 5, 1923,
and since then this court has included interest.

Section 177 of the Judicial Code referred to above is, of course, merely

declaratory of the common law "traditional rule.“ North American etc.

7. United States, 253 U.S. 330, 336; United States v. Thayer, 329 U.S.

535. 583The other cases relied onare-mostly income tax cases of which the

case, Comissionerv. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 92 L. ed. 898, is typical.
In that case it was held that each tax year is the "origin of a new
liability and a separate cause of action," and that "a subsequent modification of the significant facts or a. change or development in the
controlling legal principles may make that (prior) determination obsolete or erroneous, at least for future purposes.“ H Thus, the court held
that'an adjudication involving taxes for a particular year would not
be res judioata as to any later proceedings involving taxes for subsequent years on the theory, as stated above, ‘that each tax year constituted a Usewate cause of action," but even then, the court held that
the prior judgent acts as a collateral estoppel as to those matters
in the prior proceeding which were actually presented and determined
in the first. And further, the court said: “if a claim of liability
or non-liability relating to a pe.rticula.r tax year is litigated, la
judgnent on the merits is res  as to any subsequent proceeding

involving the same claim and the same tax year.” (Underscoring supplied)

see, also, Art Metal v. United States, 82 c. Cls. 666, International
Curtis Marine Turbine Co. V; U. S., 73 C. Cls. 132, and Chicago etc. v.
United States, 80 C. C15. 82“. It seems plain from the above that the
doctrine of collateral estoppel is only applicable when more than one
cause of action may, from the nature of the liability, arise from the
same transaction. The Cromwell and Sunnen cases are illustrative of
the idea. And where there is but one liability, as is the case under
consideration, namely, liability for the loss of land appropriated by
the Government, we do not believe the cases cited by plaintiff are
applicable.

It has been frequently decided that a judgment, as long as it remains unmodified, is effective whether the decision is right or wrong.
Reed v. Allen, 286 U.S, 191, 76 L. ed. 1051;; Baltimore 5. 5. Co. v.
Phillips, 271; U.S. 316, 71 1.. ed. 1069; Chicago etc. v. Schendel, 270
ms. 611, 70 1.. ed. 757; United States v. Moser, 266 13.5. 236, 69 1..
ed. 262, 263. So, even if we were to accept plaintiff‘s contention
that the alleged facts show an eminent domain appropriation, the
judgment would still be res judicata, since the failure to allow
interest was simply an erroneous judgment and stands as a bar to relitigating the same question, unless of course, as plaintiff contends,
the jurisdictional act prevented the allowance of interest as a part
of just compensation.

Ehis brings'ns to the really crucial question, which is whether
the jurisdictional act limited the relief to that the Court of Claims
granted, namely, the value of the lands at the time of their appropriation by defendant. In the former case, as we have stated, that court

in our former opinion and decided it was a valid adjudication as to the
value of the Fort Laramie land at the time it was appropriated by defendant.

we are still of that opinion. Moreover, we believe that even

under plaintiff's theory-that of “collateral estoppel“-—the determination by the Court of Claims is res judicata as to ‘value. Cromwell v.

County of Sac, 914 U.S. 351, 21$ L. ed. 195; Commissioner v. amnen, 333

U.S. 591, 92 L. ed. 898. This, then, narrows the inquiry to the question,

namely, whether the Court of Claims could, under the Jurisdictional act,

have awarded plaintiff interest, not as such, but as a part of just

compensation under the Fifth Amendment. The claim‘ now asserted (figuring

the interest at 5 per cent per annum, a rate commonly heretofore used)

amounts to upwards of $11,500,000 for the interest claim alone.

_ Following the passage of the above act, Congress on June 9, l930, a—

dopted Senate Joint Resolution No. 167, which in effect amended or
supplemented said act, however, it applied to lands other than the

Fort Laramie lands, so it has no bearing on this case.

A study of the Assiniboine jurisdictional act convinces us that
Congress intended that the Court of Claims be empowered to adjudicate
all claims involving appropriations of the.Assiniboine lands granted
them by the treaty of 1851. The act specifically enpowers the court
"to adjudicate, and render judgment in any and all claims arising under
or growing out of the Treaty of Fort Laramie of September 17 1851.3

 

(Underscoring supplied). as stated in United States v. Old Settlers,
1&8 U.S. Q27, 37 L. ed. 509, "a case arising from or growing out of a
treaty is one involving the rights given or protected by a treaty.‘

certainly the appropriation of the Fort Laramie lands involved rights
given or protected by the l85l treaty. Furthermore, the act expressly

conferred upon said court jurisdiction "to determine whether or not any
provision in any such treaty has been breached or violated“ by defer ant

by “acts of Congress or otherwise, and if so, to render judgment for the

damages resulting therefrom.“ (Sec. 1). These provisions define the

court's powers and, as will be seen later when we discuss the plainoiffis

have made an award for the appropriation of the Fort Laramie lands even
though there had been no express aithori ty to determine whether or not

treaty rights had been violated by defendant.

Counsel for plaintiff press three reasons why the judgment of the
They are:
(1) that under the jurisdictional act the court was confined to an award for the value of the land at the time of the appropriation and
therefore could not allow interest as a gt of just compensation under
the Fifth Amendment; (2) that under the act it could only award damages
for violation of treaty provisions,'and (3) that it was only "unlawful
appropriations“ of land that could be adjudicated.

The act did not provide for interest and under the "traditional
role" none could be allowed. United States v. Tillamooks, 31I»l 13.8. 348,
95 L. ed. 738. Moreover, its legislative history (set forth at pp. 9ll of the plaintiffis brief) shows that congress deliberately excluded
the allot-zance of ‘interest on any award the Court of Claims zzrlght make ,
and S'ec. it of the act provided that the "damages therefor (the unlawful
appropriation of plaintiff‘ s property) shall be confined to the value
of the * * '3 property at the time of such appropriation or disposal."

It may here be stated, the Indian Claims commission Act does not
‘provide for interest on its awards. Counsel for plaintiff say, however, that that act permits a recovery for property taken by eminent
domain and that interest as a fair equivalent may be allowed in addition
to the value of the property when appropriated. This is no dozibt true.

et al. v. United states, l1+8 U'.S. 311, 37 1.. ed. 1+6}, that the courts
;-; were not concluded. by legislative action in firing amount to be paid
for property taken by eminent domain. In this case, Congress authorized

the condemnation of a lock and dam but expressly excluded from the amount

1
E
‘<.'_- E .
  to be paid therefor any amount for the owner's franchise to collect tolls

 which the taking of the lock and dam deprived it of. In considering

' this limitation the court said;

 "  We are not, therefore, concluded by the declaration in

‘ ‘I  the Act that the franchise to collect tolls is not to be

considered in estimating the sum to be paid for the property.

  By this legislation. Congress seems to have assumed the

‘  right to determine what shall be the measure of compensation.

 3'; But this is a judicial, and not a legislative question. The
 _ f‘» legislature may determine that private property is needed for

public purposes—-that is a question of a political and legislative character; but when the taking has been ordered then
the question of compensation is judicial. It does not’rest
with the public taking the property, through Congress or the
legislature, its representative, to say what compensation
 shall be paid or even what shall be the rule of compensation.
.. The Constitution has declared that just compensation shall be

*  paid, and the ascertainment of that is a judicial inquiry.

And in Seaboard etc. v. United states, 261 13.5. 299, 57 L. ed. 661; (1923),
the same court said:

 ‘Just compensation is provided for by the Constitution,

. V   and the right to it cannot be ta‘-can aeay by statute. Its

ascertainment is a judicial function. " "' "' -and no specific
command to include interest is necessary when interest or
its equivalent is a part of just compensation.”

 See also Jacobs v. United states, 290 'U.S. 13, 78 L. ed. 114-2; United

 Sta-tes v. Rogers, 255 U.S. 163, 169, 65 1.. ed. 566, 563.

not prevent an allowance of interest as a part of Just compensation,
because the traditional rule forbidding the allowance of interest
against the government unless provided for  an appropriate statute
or contract, does not apply to appropriations of property under the
power of eminent domain since in such cases "the right to interest
or a fair equivalent, attaches automatically to the right to an award for damages." United States v. Creek Nation, 295 13.5. 103,‘ 1.11,
79 L. ed. 1331, 1335; Shoshone Tribe v. United States, 299 U.S. 3476,

And it is unimportant that congress deliberately denied interest,

as was the case in passing the Assiniboine jurisdictional act, for the

. same thing was done in the Shoshone case, supra, where the President

vetoed a bill. (68 cong. Record, part 3, p. 211-111») because it provided
for interest, and the congress thereafter passed a similar act with
the interest provision eliminated. When the case was tried, the
Court of Claims made an award for the value of the  taken but
made no allowance for interest as part of just compensation. On review, the Supreme court, in reversing the lower court, mde these
pertinent statements:

‘As pointed ‘out already, the bill redrafted  understood to be identical with the first one except that the

interest provision had been dropped to meet the President‘;

an appropriation of property vi thin the meaning of the
Fifth Amendment, that the jurisdictional act is silent
as to an award of interest or any substitute therefor.
United. States v. creek Nation, supra (295 13.3. 13.0, lll,

to the right to an award of damages."

'-Ehe principles stated in the Monongahela and Seaboard Air Line
cases, supra—that congress may not limit the relief for property
taken under the power of eminent domain and that no specific command
to include interest or its equivalent is necessary in such casesunderlies those Indian cases cited above in which the courts allowed
interest as a part of just compensation even though the jurisdictional
acts were silent as to  allowance. So, under the authorities before cited, since the jurisdictional act permitted the Court of Claims
to consider an appropriation of the Fort Iaramie lands, taken in such
a way as to require "just compensation" under the Fifth Amendment,
as plaintiff now contends, the limitation of the jurisdictional act-—
that the damages “shall be confined to the value of the * I 1' property
at the time of such appropriation or disposal“-—was no impediment to
that court granting full relief, that is, a fair equivalent, such. as
interest, from the time of the appropriation, in addition to the
damages it did allow.

is to the plaintiffls contention that a jurisdictional act, which
permits an award for dages for ‘breach of treaty rights does not permit an adjudication of eminent domain appropriations, we need but refer

to Shoshone v. United States, 299 17.8. 1:76, 81 L, ed. 350; United States

 ‘ they but amplified the ju.ri'sdiction otherwise granted.

7. Creek, 295 13.8. 103, 79 L. ed. 1331. In each of those cases an

adjudication of claims "arising under or growing out of treaties"
was authorized and in neither was the court expressly empowered to
award damages for violation of treaty obligations, as in the Assiniboine act; yet, in both there was an award for an appropriation of
property by the United States, taken in violation of treaty rights

. of the Indians, and the awards in both were for just compensation,

which included the equivalent of interest. tehe Shoshone case is

3-, particularly applicable here because the jurisdictional act there"

was to iadjudicate, and render judgment in any and all legal and

equitable claims which the Shoshone Tribe * * '3 may have * ‘ 1'

No express power was granted to determine whether treaty provisions

’ 1 had been breached, as in the Assiniboine Act, yet the court held:

unless ‘such a cause of action * " * was already in
existence. Under the jurisdictional act the court was
to inquire whether the violation of the treaty of 1868
or some later act of Congress had given rise to legal
!or equitable grounds of liability.!!

So, it seems clear that the provisions of the Assiniboine act re'-  E;  - specting the violation of treaty stipulations gave the court no more

authority than it was otherwise given to adjudicate claims arising
under or growing out of breach of provisions of the 1851 treaty;
The use of
the term “legal and equitable claims“ in the Shoshone Act did not
qualify or abridge the court's power to consider treaty violations

which might give rise to leal or equitable grounds for recovery.

OI-at-‘alto.

If anything, the Assiniboine act is we broader as to jurisdictional

powers sincethe words “legal and equitable! do not appear therein.

We pass now to the third proposition advanced by plaintiff. It
is contended that since Section 1+ of the Assiniboine jurisdictional
act Permitted recovery only for lands *unlawi‘ully appropriated or disposed of” by defendant, no recovery could have been awarded for lands
taken under the power of eminent domain, because such a taking is ‘_n_o_t.

an unlawful taking. citing masath v. United States, 301: ms. 3.19,

 

82 L. ed. 1219, and a number of other cases, which we have examined.
It may be conceded that where the Government takes Indian or other
property under congressional authority or direction, such a taking ,
being in the exercise oi‘ itssovereign power, therefore is not an unlawful appropriation of property and, it my be added, it makes no
difference how the power is exercised, whether by condemnation proceedings, or without such formal proceedings, given the right to take
property, the taking is lavdul. Jacobs v. United States, 290 ms. 13,
73 1.. ed. 1142. 0

Fhe iundaxnental error of plaintiff's contention is in the position that the Fort Iaramie lands were taken in a mnner that constituted an eminent domain appropriation pursuant to congressional anthority. An enznination of the authorities relied upon by plaintiff
will show that in every case the taking of the property in question
was pursuant to Congressional authority or direction. " Take the Klamath
case, for example: 87,000 acres of the Indianhs. land were given to another by an act of Congress in exchange for a larger area of lands

belonging to the sa.me_t:.'.'ibe, which had been previously taken from them.

Without doubt the 87,000 acres were taken under the power of eminent
domin, for congress, by the act of J‘u.ne 21, 1906, 31; stat. 325,
authorized the exchange and, therefore, the appropriation of the lands
was lawful, but in the case at bar there was no such taking shown by

the facts in the former case, or by the allegations of the amended

petition in the pending case, on the contrary, it plainly appears

that the Fort Laramie land was taken by executive or administrative

action. Thus, congressional authority for the taking or ratification

after the taking, a requisite to constitute a lawful taking, was absent.

United. States v. Goltra, 312 o.s. 203, 35 L. ed. 776. where, however,
the Government takes the property of another without previous Congressional authority or direction, the taking is‘ considered, at least
for jurisdictional purposes, wrongful and imposes upon the Government
an implied. duty to pay just compensation therefor by reason of the
Fifth Amendment. The Shoshone and creek cases, supra, show the
difference between a lawful  an unlawful appropriation of Indian
lands. In both, as plaintiff contends, and as the Supreme Court in
the Gialtza case, supra, said concerning them, the taking was unlawful
(tortious) . For unauthorized talsings of non-Indian property, see
Jacobs 1?. United States, 290 11.8. 13, 78 L. ed. 1’-F2; United States

v. Lynch, 188 U.S. ‘+1843, 1:7 1.. ed. 539; United States v. Ho:-th American
etc. oo., 253 ms’. 330, 634 1.. ed. 935; Cress v. United States, 215
11.5. 316, 61 L. ed. 746. The Assiniboine land was not taken pursuant
to legislative authority, as we have stated, and plaintiff does not

plead it was, so the argument that the jurisdictional act in the

former case did not permit an adjudication of "lawful takings" is of

o .: . ’. '
_ . . . _. _
-r I .-:-‘.1-..AJ.A-o .34» .a-- no -0 --'- 'no avail since the facts now pleaded do not bring the case within the
rule in.the Xlamth case or any of the others‘ cited by plaintiff,
where property was  pursuant to specific Congressional action.
Vfhat we have said concerning the jurisdictional act of 1927
brings forward the rule against splitting a. demand and prosecuting

it piecemeal. .This rule is plainly stated in stark v. Starr, 91+ ‘ms.
1:77, 21+ 1.. ed. 276, thus:

‘It is undoubtedly a settled. principle that a party
seeking to enforce a claim, legal or equitable, must
present to the court, either by the pleadings or proofs

or both, all the grounds upon which he expects a judgaent
in his favor. He is not at liberty to split up his demand

and prosecute it by piecemeal, or present only a portion

of the grounds upon which special relief is sought, and

leave the rest to be presented in a second suit, if the

first fail. There would be no end to litigation if such

a practice were permissible.“ see also United. States v.

California and 0. Land. Co., 192 13.5. 355, 1:5 L. ed. 1:76;

Baltimore v. Phillips, 271: 13.8. 316, 71 L. ec_1. 1069. ~

The plaintiff here has actually now sued only for interest as a
part of just compensation’. In the former case, according to plaintiff,
the interest item was not pressed. If this be so, and the Jurisdictional act in the former case did not ‘and could not, as we have ‘stated,
prevent such an allowance, under the authorities cited above, including
those just cited, the bar of res j'u,d.ica.ta must be applied,

Plaintiff mkes the point that there was no determination of the

former case on the merits because the Court of claims did not allow

interest in addition to the value of the lands it awarded. In support
of this assertion they refer to this language contained in a statement
of the House Managers which was attached to the Conference Report (No.

2693, my 27, 19%, scene) on 2.3. M97, which bill, as amended, became the Indian claims Commission Act;

‘Nor is this amendment intended to preclude the
adjudication by the commission of any claim authorized
' to be heard and determined under this section which has

not been in fact previously adjudicated or settled on

its merits, or as to which it has been previously held

that the court had no judicial power to determine.“

Ibis statement is in line with the well recognized rule, but, obviously it has no bearing upon cases that have been adjudicated on the
merits or to cases as to which the court has not held it has no Judicial power to determine. In the case before us all ultimte substantive issues were determined by the court of claims in the former
case under a jurisdictional act permitting mu reparation for the
lands unlawfully taken; if, as plaintiff now claims, full compensation (interest) was not allowed the plaintiff not having appealed,
the Judgment stands and is a bar to relitigating the same demand.

States, 80 0. C13. 708.

Under the caption, ‘Res judicata is no defense where there has
been a change in the law," plaintiff contends that the Indian claims
Commission Act has changed the law and has created a new and altered.
situation which bars res judicata as a defense. In what respect the
act has changed the law is not stated. 1: it is’ thought that the

Indian Claims Commission Act permits a trial §_._e_ novo oi’ adjudicated

claims, we believe this language used in the case, K1.-heath ‘i’. United
States, 296 ms. 2?-+11», so 1.. ed. 202, is the answer: -It goes without saying that, if Congress intended to grant so sweeping and unique

- privilege, it would make the purpose unmistalcenly plain." Cf. same

case, 81 C. Cls. 79. we see nothing in the Indian Claims Commission

OFFSEIS, FORMER. ADJU'DIC.aTION OF

The contention is again made that the court of Claims mde no
final determination of the offsets allowed in the former case. Our
views were set forth in the former opinion and since we have not changed
them it would be unnecessary repetition to restate them here. Allowed
offsets in another case which exceed the amount of a former award do

not present an insurmountable problem to the determination of which, or
the part of which, may be available in other cases. see Haw Tribe v.

United States, Dockets 33 and 35, 2 Ind. Claims com. 1334.

EFFECT O? DECISIONS IN THE ALCEA ED AL. V. UNITED S'JLTES

 

But aside from the jurisdictional problems presented by plaintiff,

and which we have discussed above, we believe later decisions of the
Court of Claims and the Supreme Court confirm the action of the Court
of Claims  not allowing interest in the former case. In the case,
Alcea Band v. United States, 103 c. Cls. ugh, the Court of Claims decided that the appropriation of lands held by the Tinamook Indians
under original Indian title, that is, Indian right of oocu@cy, based

upon aboriginal possession, was compensable. This holding was approved

by the Supreme Court (329 17.3. 740, 91 L. ed. 29). The land involved
in that case was taken by an Executive order dated Eov. 9, 1855 (l
Kapp. 890-1) and the Supreme Court held on April , 1951, 31;]. U.S.
1+8, 95 L. ed. T38, that the recovery for the taking of the land was
not grounded upon the Fifth knendment and disallowed interest. It

has been suggested that the riling applies only to cases where Indian

lands held by original Indian title are taken through executive or
administrative action, and does not apply to such appropriations of
land held by the Indians under title recogized by the Government.

It seems obvious that whether the Indian title is “recognized” or "unrecognized! it is only the right of occupancy the Indians had, and in

' either case it is this right of occupancy that the Indians were deprived

of by the official action. There would seem to be no logical reason
for denying the Indians the protection of the Fifth Amendment for the
taking of lands held under original Indian title by executive action
and giving such protection where lands so taken are held under "recognized“ title. As we understand the decision of the Supreme Court it
is the manner of taking that determines whether‘ the Fifth Amendment
applies and not the tenure of occupancy, that is, not on whether the
right of occupancy has been recognized by some governmental acknowledgment or whether the right of occupancy is based upon aboriginal possession. I

Applying the above reasoning to the Assiniboine case, where the
lands were appropriated by executive or administrative action and without Congressional authority, we must conclude that the Fifth Amendment
does not apply and the Cenrt of Claims was correct in not allowing
interest as a part of Just compensation.

By reason of the foregoing the motion for summary judgment must

be sustained and the amended petition dismissed.

¢—.—--- -u.- cu.-.ttitt, Chief Commissioner, concurring;

I agree that defendantis motion for sunmary jud@1ent based on

the plea of res Judicata is good and that the amended petition should

be dismissed...

Regardless of whether the jurisdictional act upon which the decision of the court of Claims (77 C. cls. 31%?)  based authorizes
the court of Claims to award plaintiff ‘just compensation" or does
not do so; or whether or not plaintiff's lands were taken in a manner
entitling plaintiff to just compensation--the writer thinks the plea
of £35 judicata should be sustained.

Ehe plaintiff had a single cause of action, to-wit: one for damages
sustained by reason of the loss of its lands. .It ‘elected to ‘bring suit
on that cause of action under the jurisdictional ‘act upon which the

decision pleaded as _:_‘_e_s_ judicata was a final determination of that
lawsuit and“ of that cause of action.

The pending case is in effect a claim for interest which was not
allowed it in the decision upon which the plea of _r_e_s_s_ judicata is ‘based...
Ehis: claim for interest, however, is not a severable cause of action.
Ehe right to interest, if plaintiff ever was entitled to same, did not
and does not of itself and ‘by itself constitute 'a cause of action.

If recoverable at any time it was merely an element of the damages

to plaintiff ‘by reason of the loss of the 1and—an element of a single
cause of action. Therefore, the well recognized rule denying the i
right to split a cause of action, which is briefly discussed in the

main opinion, is thought by the writer to apply to the pending cause
