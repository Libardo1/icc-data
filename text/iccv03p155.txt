claimed here and as of a date over one hundred years ago. Neither party

should be required to go into such matters until the status of the Indian
title is first determined as of the date the cause of action arose.

The legal problems. as submitted by the stipulation are the follow;

 Second Defense. That the Fort Laramie Treaty, dated September
17, 1851, 11 Stat. TH9, 2 Kapp. 5911», is solely a treaty of amity,
and that under it the Crows acquired no compensable estate in the
lands described; " '0

Third Defense. That the issues alleged in the petition are
resgudicata by virtue of the prior decision rendered ‘in Crowd
Ration v. United States, Case No. H-2148, reported _in 81 C. C13.

233;. .. '.

Fourth Defense. That the Commission has no ,j'uris'diction by
virtue of Section 1% of the Act approved July 3, 1926, 1414 Stat. 807,
which provided: b

‘II

"' * ‘awith reference to all claims which may be the subject
matter of the suits herein authorized, the decree of_the court

shall be in full settlement of all damages, if any, committed

by the-Governmentmf the United States and shall annul and

cancel all claims, right, and title of the said Crow Indians

in and to such money or other property. a

The parties hereto have submitted Exhibits Nos. 1 to 1&3, inclusive,
as evidence bearing upon the issues raised by the above three defenses.

The claim here asserted grows out of the Treaty of May 7, 1868,
15 stat. 6119 (Finding 3). By that treaty the Crows ceded to the United
States the 30,530,761!-.3 acres of land here involved to which, they allege,

the defendant by the treaty of September 17. 1851. 11 stat. 7b,9,

‘acknowledged, ratified and confirmed" the petitioner's “ownership and
right of occupancy, possession and'use.' The second defense, stated
above, puts in issue the validity of these allegations. The importance
of the issue thus raised is obvious. If by the treaty of 1851 (Finding
2), the defendant confirmed the aboriginal possession of petitioner to the
land, proof of such title is not necessary. United States v. Alcea, 329
U. s. 140, 91 L. Ed. 29. on the other hand, if there has been no such
confirmation or acknowledgment, proof of aboriginal possession will be
necessary if petitioner is to recover, provided, of course, in.either case

unconscionable consideration is also proved.

Of the several sources of tribal property rights we are here concerned

gwith only two:

(a) Aboriginal possession, which is the primary source of Indian
title and is based upon immemorial occupancy. This is known as
“original Indian title" or “unrecognized” title. The Government
insists that it is this original title the Crows had at the time of
the 1866 cession and.that such title is not compensable.

(b) Ehe second source of tribal rights in land is that which
results from treaty or statute which expressly or impliedly confirms
or acknowledges the Indians‘ aboriginal possession. This is generally‘
referred to by the courts as "recognized “ title. This type of title
generally, but.not always, arises when a treaty reserves from the
ceded area a reduced or delimited area for the use of the tribe. but:
as will be seen later, a treaty may recognize original Indian title
without creating a reservation. The Crows maintain that by the Fort
Laramie treaty the Government recognized their aboriginal possession
to the lands here in controversy.

is we understand the law, the Indians, whether they have “unrecognized”

I or “recognized” title to lands, they have the same right-of possession.

The dichotomy of “recognized” and “unrecognized” Indian tribal rights
seem.unimportant here unless we should.find it necessary to determine

thether ”unrecognized“ Indian nights are compensable. {he Government,

however, does not here contend, nor has it ever contended, that "recognized" Indian rights are not compensable.

Second Defense.
The second. defense squarely presents the question as to whether the

Government, by the treaty of September 17, _l951._- 11 Stat. 7149, recogé
nized the aboriginal rights of the Crow Indians in; the lands designated
in that treaty  the "territory of the Crow Nation." We shall, there?fore, examine the evidence and decisions of the Court of Claims and
Supreme Qourt_bearing on that question._

It is necessary and proper to consider the evidence offered to
determine the pugose, intent and effect of the-_For_t_ Laramie Treaty. of.
Northwestern Shoshone v. United States, 95 C. Cls.'.- 6&2; 3234 U. S. 335.
This seems especially necessary in this case because the treaty text is
not complete enough to definitely reveal whetherthe Government intended
to recogize Indian title to the__vast domain designated by the treaty as

the "territory. of the Crow Nation." ;

In 1811-7 and prior thereto, the Indians of the plains had carried on

almost constant warfare between the various tribes. The situation was

so serious the Superintendent of the: Fort Leavenworth Agency made a lengthy
report of the conditions on October 29, 18117 (Ex. I) and 1s:;ged a general
council of the tribes to be held in the buffalo country for the purpose

of forming treaties of peace and friendship between the tribes, with the
United States a party for the purpose of enforcing the agreements. And

on September 25. I81!-8 (‘P . 2, p. 14-69) we find the Agent of the Upper

Missouri Agency advising the Superintendent of Indian Affairs: ‘'1 take

the position that to civilize the Indians, you must give them personal

security from domestic war, with permanent habitations " "'."

The discovery of gold“-on the west coast about l8lL8 increased the pp
emigration through the Indian country ‘with. the resulting destruction of

buffalo. other game, forage, timber, etc-. which threatened the liveliehood and subsistence of the Indians. To alleviate these conditions and

to bring about peace between the tribes. including the Crows, the Com?missioner of Indian Affairs, on August 16. 13.119, with the approval of_
the Secretary of the Interior, directed treaties be made with the Indian

tribes "binding them to abstain from hostilities against each other“

and “from molesting in any way our military expeditions or emigrants.”
In addition, he instructed his" agent. Thomas Fitzpatrick, who was one

of the treaty Commissioners_on the 1851 ‘treaty:

“There should be a clear and definite understanding. as to
the general boundaries of sections of country respectively

claimed by them. as their residence and hunting grounds."

(Ex. 3-A).

In a letter from the office of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs
(Ex. 3), dated June 15. 1818,  which inspired the August 16. 1811-9
letter, reference is made to the Indian country which the Indians “until.
recently, they have, unmolested, held undisputed possession of the

country, which they regard as their own.“

Again we find a report (Ex. 1|», p. 1071) dated October I3, 1818, from
the Superintendent of Indian Affairs to the Commissioner in which the

Superintendent, D. D. Mitchell. says:

"' " " Again, the boundaries dividing the different tribes have
never been settled or defined; this is the fruitful source of
many of their bloody strifes, and can only be removed by mutual
concessions, sanctioned by the government of the United States.
The boundaries being once established and clearly understood,
each tribe could be held responsible for any depredations that
might be committed within their respective territories.

their game, timber, etc.," by the whites.

From the above, it will be seen that responsible officials of the
Government, men in position to know "and appreciate the Indian problem
existing in the plains area, recognized Indian possessory rights to the
vast plains area extending to the Rocky Mountains on the west and there
became _a consciousness of the need of dividing. the area among the tribes
and fixing boundaries in accordance with the traditional habitats of the
several plains tribes. The objects to be attained were principally, to
end the internecine warfare between the tribes, make travel through their
domains safe for the emigrant white men, travel generally, movement of
troops, etc., and to provide ‘for the eventual civilization of, the Indians.
During the period long prior to 1851 the Government," if not expressly, at
least tacitly, recognized_the right of the various tribes to occupy and
use in the accustomed Indian manner the great plains of the west. All
responsible and informed agents and superintendents seemed agreed upon
the necessity of fixing tribal boundaries as a means of remedying the
chaotic conditions existing in the west, not only as between the Indians
themselves, but between the Government and the. Indians. Most Commis-L
sioners of Indian Affairs seem to share this view of their subordinates.

Apparently the general council of Indians directed by the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs, mentioned above, was never called, however, such a
council was held pursuant to an Act of Congress as a further step for
quelling the troubles in the buffalo country.

The first Congressional step  the direction of stabilizing the

situation was the appropriation of February 27, 1851, 9 Stat. 570, for

President . - -~

_The Commissionerof Indian Affairs by his letter dated May 26, l85l,
directed to D. 1). Mitchell, notified him of his appointment and the appoint-l
ment of Fitzpatrick as treaty commissioners, outlined the general policy
oi‘ the Government with respect to the prairie Indians, and instructed the
Commissioners as follows as to theprojected treaties:

It is important, if practicable, to establish for each tribe
some fixed boundaries. within which they should stipulate generally
to reside; and each should agree not to intrude within the limits
assigned to another tribe without its consent. If in arranging
such boundaries, there should be a portion of country not included,
where it has been their habit to go periodically in pursuit of
game, it should be recognised as a neutral ground, where all will

enjoy equal privileges, and have no right to molest or interfere
-with one another.

In his addresses to the Indians at the treaty council at Fort Laramie
Colonel Mitchell frequently used language indicating a recognition of

Indian rights in the territory known as the great plains or prairie. such

as ‘your lands", "your countries“, and similar language. Kt the council

meeting of September 8, 1851, (Ex. 25-b) he proposed:

In order that justice may be done each nation, it is proposed that your country shall be diwiided into geographical .
districts-—that the country and its boundaries shall be designated by such rivers. mountains and lines as will show what
country each nation claims and where they are located. In doing
this it is not intended to take any of your lands away, or to
destroy. your rights to hunt, or fish, or pass over the country,
‘as heretofore. But it will be expected that each nation will be
held responsible for depredations comitted within its territory,
unless it can be clearly shown that people of some other nation
comitted them, and then that nation will be held responsible. Your Great Father only desires to punish the guilty and reward
the good. When a horse is stolen, _or a scalp taken, or a. woman
or child carried off, or any other wrong done, he wants to find
out who did it, and punish the bad men or nations; and the nation
will be held responsible for the acts of its people.

The treaty was concluded September 17, 1851, (Finding 2), and.by its provisions the country was divided into districts and each tribe, including
-F} the Crows, was given an area with well defined boundaries, the Crows
; district being described as set forth in Finding 2, and containing
38,53l,l7h acres.

D. D. Mitchell, one of the treaty commissioners,_made his report of
.the proceedings at Fort_Iaramie to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs on

November 11, 1851 (Ex. 5, pp. 288-290), with which he transmitted the

  treaty concluded by himself and Fitzpatrick. This report, among other

things, contains the following significant statements:

  I The most important provisions in the accompanying treaty

are considered to be the following: 1. The right acknowledged
and granted, on the part of the Indians, to the United §tates,
to establish roads, military and other posts throughout the
Indian country, so far as they claim or exercise ownership

over it. 2. The solemn obligations they have entered into to
maintain peaceful relations among themselves, and to abstain
from all depredations upon the whites passing through the

 ' country, and to make restitution for any damages or lossuthat

a white man shall sustain by the acts of their people. 3. The
settling, of all former complaints on the part of the Indians for
the destruction of their buffalo, timber, grass, etc., caused

  by the passing of the whites through their country; the presents

received at the time were considered as full payment.

And later in his report he says:

The laying off of the country into geographical or rather

national domains I regard as a very important measure, inasmuch
as it will take away a great cause of quarrel among themselves,
and at the same time enable the Government to ascertain who are

* " __: r The accompanying map, upon which these national boundaries are

_l -1 _ clearly marked and defined, was made in the presence of the
Indians, and fully approved and sanctioned by all. As a map of
reference, it will be of great service to the Government.

'- J. ‘L  Viewing the treaty in all its provisions, I am clearly of

the opinion that it is the best that could have been made for
both parties. I am moreover of the opinion that it will be
observed and carried out in as good faith on the part of the
Indians, as it will on the part of the United States and the
white people thereof.

This report and the Fort Laramie ‘frosty were-snhmitted to the Senate

the Senate ratified thetreaty on_-Hay an, 1,852, with an amendment of

Article-_ 7 thereof respecting the~anmii,ty payments (14 Kapp. 10,65). The

Cross accepted the amendment on »S‘optembe_r 18, 185%. Hhile the treaty

There are other data in the grecord showing official recognition of
the aboriginal title of the Cross in the lands designated and described
by definite boundaries, as '*territory_ of the Cromlfation“ -by the treaty
of September 17, 1851, but we shall close this r!ecital,of facts yrith
-this excerpt from the report of _'the Commissioners-who negotiatedpthe

1868 treaty with the Crows:

“These Indians have never founded the title to their lands

upon the treaty of 1851.; They have looked upon that treaty
as a mere acknowledgment of a previously existing right 
themselves. The assignment of boundaries, they supposed. was
merely to fix rights among the tribes ii o . . to make certain

that was uncertain before.“ (13. 1905, Part 1; of Pacific Land
Grant Hearings. See stipulation, he 23).

The relinquishment by the Grows in the 1868 treaty {Finding 3) of
‘all their title, claims, or rights in and to any portion of the territory_'of the United States, except as is embraced within the limits af oresaid‘ 4- the 8,000,’-lO9.2 acres reserved - is not rithont significance,
for it was inserted for the benefit  the Government, nor are the sub?stantial emenditures the Governmentrobligated itself to make for the

Crows by the l868 treaty. While the relinquishment considered alone may

gnqt be :::onclusive‘on the- questionof recognition of Crow title, it

certainly ceded 30,530,761!» acres of the area designated as Crow territory
in the 1851 treaty, and under all the facts surrounding the designation
of Crow country, must be considered as having an important bearing,
especially in view of the substantial expenditures the Government committed itself to make for the maintenance of the Indians (Article 7)

and its express agreement (Article 3) to protect the Crows "against the

commission of all depredations by the people” of the United States.

DECISIONS or coonr or CLAIMS AND surname covert

Court of Claims Cases ,
In three cases the Court

 

of Claims had occasion to consider the

treaty of September 17, 1851. Fort Laramie Treaty, and in each directly

or in effect held that  that treaty the United States confirmed original

Indian title in the tribal signatories thereto, including the Crows.
We shall’not extend this discussion in order to determine whether
the former judgents of the Court ofclaims ‘constitute collateral

estoppel under the doctrine of res gudicata or whether those decisions

Under either rule we would, as we must, be

bound by the determination of the Court of Claims on the facts which

were before that court and are now before us on the question of original
Indian title based upon the ‘same document, the Fort Laramie Treaty.

As we said in the Seminole case, 2 Ind. Cls. C. 122, 130, regarding
effect of statements contained in a Court of Claims decision:

"Counsel for petitioner attempts to minimize the effect
of these statements by saying that the court finally decided

J.a...."|'.\..:..‘..'.a».:..J...-L1,. 'Ir- ..-, -' 4.it had no jurisdiction. That is true, but we fail to see why
that should affect the weight of that court's statements on a

question of fact before it. We think it is entitled to serious
consideration in so far as applicable here.“ “ ' ”

a.

The first case involving the Fort Laramie Treaty was‘ that of Fort

Berthold v. United States, ‘[1 C. C1s."308, decided in 1930. These. Indians

were also parties to the treaty and sued for the value of the tract of
country “recognized and acknowledged" _'as theirs by said treaty which had

been taken by the United States without. compensation. In holding that

these Indians were entitled to compensation the court discussed‘ the

question of Precognized" title in these words:

"It is true the treaty abounds in other considerations for _
its execution, but the one involved.here, i.e., distinct reservations, is not only specific in its terms, obligating the parties
to irrevocable observance of the limits of lands set forth, but
reserves in express words the claims of the Indians to other
lands. The defendant says the territorial provisions were simply
mutual recognition by the Indians of their claims to territory
and'its segregation by them, without positive governmental
recognition or verification of the same. This contention, as
we view it, concedes that when the commissioners approached
the Indians their title by right of occupancy to all the I
territory.embraced.within the treaty was recognized.by the
commissioners representing the Government, and that what the
treaty did.was to_segregate the same into individual tribal
allotments. In other words, the Government not only recognized
the Indian title, never at any time disputing it,'but by solemn
treaty, following negotiations, expressly agreed that each tribe
‘was to be assured title to the territory set aside for it. Surelyit was not essential to procure by treaty the grant of a perpetual

right of way through.Indian lands if the Indians did not own the
same by right of occupancy.

: 3 t

"The language of the treaty, while not in all respects the
technical wording used.in other Indian treaties,is, we think,
sufficient when considered.in connection with the instrument as
ia.whole and the purpose and intent of the parties thereto, to
clearky indicate that the territory of the Indians was to be
delimited in accord.with.their claims ad.protection assured
them within its bounds, in consideration of the rights and
privileges secured to the United States and its citizens.”

The next case was.Assiniboine v. United States, 77 C. Cls. 337.

decided in 1933. This case involved, among others, a claim for the lands

assigned to the Assiniboine by the Fort Laramie treaty  the Court of
Claims held that these Lands ‘were expressly granted to the plaintiff
(Assiniboine) tribeby the treaty made with the plaintiff on September 17,

1851. ‘and one of its purposes was to give each tribe some fixed boundaries
within which they should stipulate generally to reside.“ This case was

evidently_ based upon the Fort Berthold case referred to above.’
The third case involving the Fort Laramie Treaty was Crow Nation vi.

United_States. 81 0. C13. 238. Here again thewcourt of Claims held, upon

the facts now before us, that the United States recognized the title of

the Crows by the Fort Laramie treaty. Here is what the court said:

""' "‘ " It appears that the Crow Nation entered into a
treaty with the United‘ States in 1851. along with other
Indian nations, known as the ‘Fort Laramie Treaty‘, in‘
which the Government set aside a reservation of some 38
million acres to the Crow Nation. The territory reserved
for this Indian nation was situate in what are now the States

of Hontana and Wyoming.
I I I

“In the case of the Fort Berthold Indians v. §_e_ United
States. ‘[1 C. Cls. 308, this court decided that the treaty
entered into between the United States and these 
tribes in 1851, and known as the ‘Fort Laramie Treaty’, was
duly ratified by the Indians and was an existing and binding
treaty on all parties thereto; that under this treaty the
Indians received the reservation of the lands described
therein and the Government recognized their right of occupancy
to the lands so reserved.i —

In Blacweet v. United States.‘ 81 0. Ole. 101, a treaty similar to

the Fort Laranrie was involved and a. large award made, apparently on the

basis of the Fort Berthold. decision.
Beyond doubt, the Court of Claims held in the Fort Berthold. Assisiboine and Grow cases that the ‘Fort Laramie treaty created reservations

for those Indians and it made awards in the first two because of the

rights confirmed by that treaty. As we have seen from the quotation

from the.I'ort Berthold case, supra: “the one issue vital to the plaintiff Indians‘ right of recovery is whether this article 5 of the Fort
Laramie tr_eatf/ did or did not create an Indian reservation,“ that was

the controlling issue which governed the court's decision and judgment.

The government concedes this is so but contends those cases were overruled by the Smreme Court in United States v. Northern Pacific, 311

U. s. 317, .35 L.’ 3:1. no.

Obviously, it was not necessary for the Court of Claims in the

' Berthold case, or in the Assiniboine case which followed. to decide that

the Fort Laramie treaty;created‘_Indian reservations in order to award

damages to those tribes; it could have and. as we believe,__ did in effect

decide that the Fort Laramie treaty recognized the “title of the respective

tribes in the lands therein designated for each. This view seems to have

confirmation by the Supreme Court in the case now to be considered.
In the case, _No:_:-thwestern Shoshone Indians v. Unitedhstates, 3211-,
U. S.335, the Indians sued to recover damages for the taking of a. large

area of land held by the Indians byaboriginal title which they claimed

was recogized by the United States by the treaty of July 30, 1863. These

Indians contended that the Fort Berthold, Assiniboine and Grow cases

supported their claim of recogized title. In commenting on the cases,

the Supreme Court said:

“"' " "' Apart from the fact that different treaties are
involved. the circumstances surrounding the execution of the

Fort Laramie treaty indicate a purpose to recognize the Indian
title to the lands described in the Fort Laramie treaty which
may well have induced the Court of Claims to reach one conclusion

in those cases and another in this. For example, the instructions

to the commissioners for the Fort Laramie negotiations contained
this direction: -I i

‘It is important, if practicable, to establish for each tribe
some fixed boundaries within which they should stipulate generally to reside, and each should agree not to intrude within the

limits assigned to another tribe without its consent’. 71 C. Cls.
312.

Further in reporting the treaty it was said:

‘The laying off of the country into geographical, or rather
nation domains, I regard as a very important measure, inasmuch
as it will take away a great cause of quarrel among themselves,
and at the same time enable the Government to ascertain who are
the depredators, shou1d.depredations hereafter be committed.‘
7]. C. 0150 

"Furthermore, the words of the-Fort Laramie treaty are more

apt to express recognition of Indian title than those of Box
Elder. Article 5 says:

‘The aforesaid Indian nations do hereby recognize and
acknowledge the following tracts of country, included withr
in the metes and boundaries hereinafter designated, as their
respective territories, viz: ’ * * ’ ,' 71 C. Cls. 315.

“In consideration of the treaty stipulations the United-States

bound itself to furnish.supplies and to protect the Indian

nations against depredations by its citizens. Such distinctions

may quite justifiably have led the Court of Claims to different

conclusions than it reached from consideration of the Northwestern.Shoshone treaty."

This language plainly shows that the establishment of a reservation
is not necessary to constitute "recognized title“ and that the reports and
actions of government officials and other circumstances surrounding the
negotiation and conclusion of the Fort Laramie treaty; which we have above
alluded.to, show a.purpose to recognize the original Indian title of the
Indians, including the Crow.

We shall now consider the United States v. Northern Pacific case,

By the act of July 2, 186M, 13 stat. 365. ch. 217, the United States
granted the_Northern Pacific Railroad Conpany a vast amount of land in
aid of the construction of railroad and telegraph line from a point on

Lake Superior to Puget Sound, with a branch via the Columbia River tod

Portland, Oregon. The grant was for alternate sections on each side of

the line of the railroad. The line of the railroad extended_across the
areas designated as Indian territories by the treaties of September 17,
1851 (Feet Laramie) and October 17, 1855, 11 Stat. 657 (Blackfeet) and

the Northern Pacific received under the act patents to lands in such

areas aggregating 13,300,000 acres, which included part of the 38,53l,l7h
acres designated as the territory of the Crow Nation in the Fort Laramie
Treaty.‘

Section 2 of the 186M act provided: “The United States shall
extinguish, as rapidly as may be_consistent with public policy and the
welfare of said Indians, the Indian titles to all lands falling under
the operation of this act, and acquired in the donation to the zfbaéf
named in this bill.“

Section 3_of the act limited.the grant to lands to which the 0nited
States “have full title,_n2t_reserved, sold, granted, or otherwise
appropriated, and.free from preemption, or other.claims or rights, at
the time the line of said road is definitely fixed ' ‘."

The Government brought suit against the Railroad alleging the patents
to the 13,300,000 acres of such treaty lands were wrongfully issued and

therefore null and void because the lands covered by such.patents were

lands within the treaty limits of the 1851 and 1855 treaties which were

by said treaties set apart and reserved for the signatory Indian tribes

_.-_.-... ...—-—-----.1:--—— and.therefore, by the quoted.provisions of section 3 of the l86h act,
were excluded.from the operation of the grant (Ex. IN, pp. 66-70).

This contention was set forth in.subdivision XXIX of the bill in equity

which related to the treaty lands.

The trial court denied the Government's claim to the treaty lands
.and in reference to the Government's contention said (Ex. 17):

I feel that a few brief observations are in order concerning
Subdivision XXIX of the bill relating to the Fort Laramie Treaty
of September 17. 1851, and the Blackfoot Treaty of October 17,
1855+-this because of the recent decisions of the Court of Claims
in the Fort Berthold case, decided December 1, 1930, and the
Blackfoot case, decided April 10, l933, and the kindred cases
decided.by that court dealing with the same or similar questions.
,None of these cases either held or intimated that the lands
covered by the treaties in question were reserved lands within the
meaning of Section 3 of the Act of July 2,-186R. Under the broad
Jurisdictional acts, pursuant to which these cases were instituted,
it was not necessary to recovery by the Indians that the land he
held.to constitute a technical reservation under the treaties and
we must not be misled by the broad language employed in the
opinions of the court. These treaties may well give rise to substantial recovery by the Indians without at all imolying that the
lands assigned to the various tribes under the nrovisions of the
treaties were removed from the operation of the original land

grant to the railway company. (Emphasis addedl.

On appeal to the Supreme Court by the Government, 311 U. S. 317.

 

   

31:7-;31»9, 85 L. Ed. 210, 228-229, that court affirmed the District Court's
denial of the Governnent‘s claim for the 13,300,000 acres of Indian.treaty
lands, which incIuded.lands in the Crow territory. It seems, however,

that no part of the lands granted.the railroad.by the l864 act was actually
taken fron the Crows. This was because the—Crows had.by the treaty of
May 7, 1868 (Finding 3) relinquished to the United States all the lands
set apart to then by the Fort laramie Treaty, except some 8,000,000 acres.

for the permanent use of the Crows. As we see by the provisions of section

3 of the 186% act quoted above, the railroad grant attached “at the time

the line of said read is definitely fixed.” The line was not definitely
fixed in the Crow area until long after the 1868 treaty became effective,
so when the railroad grant became operative on the Crow territory the
Government had "full title" to the relinquished Crow lands, and the lands
within the Crow reservation, some 8,000,000 acres, became "reserved"
‘lands under said section 3 and did not pass under the grant. But however

this may be, the legal basis for the decisions above discussed applies

to this case.

_ Returning now to the case, ‘United States v. Northern Pacific Railway
Company, supra - as we have said_before, it is this case the Government
relies upon as finally determining that no reservations were created
by the Fort Laramie Treaty and hence no recognition of Indian title
resulted therefrom, as we understand the argument.

After affirming the trial court's action in dismissing the Government's claim -for the 13,300,000 acres of treaty land (jp. '31&7), the

Supreme Court said, as reasons therefor:

By an act of June 30, 1831L,'all lands lying west of the
Mississippi River, not within the States of Missouri and
Louisiana or the Territory of Arkansas, were designated as
Indian country. The fee of all this territory was in the
United States, subject to the Indian right of occupancy.

The treaties of 1851 and 1855 did not alter the status of

the lands described in them. The purpose of those treaties
was to estahlish.peace and.amity between warring Indian tribes
inter sees and between the tribes and the United States. To
this end the country or territory of each tribe was described
and the tribes agreed to respect the boundaries named.in the
treaties.

By these statements the court recognized the Indians‘ right of occupancy

of the tribes to their respective territories bounded by the Fort Laramie

admit the f-ee_Was always in the United States and that their right was

only one of occupancy.

Continuing, the court said:

' BY 3 2 of the Act of 1861+, it was provided that “The United
States shall extinguish. as rapidly as may be consistent with
public policy and the welfare of the said Indians, the Indian

titles to all lands falling under the operation of this act,
and acquired in the donation to the [E-can named in this bill.“
In at at .Section 3 limits the land grant to lands as to which the
United States "have full title, not reserved, sold, granted.
or otherwise appropriated. and free from preemption, orother
claims or rights. at the time the line of said road is definitely
fixed, . . ." The Government contends that this section excludes
lands embraced within the treaty limits for the reason that the
treaties “reserve” all the lands described in them for the signatory Indian tribes. We think the contention is unsound.

is we have noted, the treaties did not create technical

reservations as have many other treaties and acts of Congress.
They did not set aside a defined territory for the exclusive use
of a tribe nor contain the usual provisions for an Indian Agent
for schools. assistance in farming operations, etc. The country
described in the Treaty of 1851 amounts to one hundred and sixtythree million acres and that described in the Treaty of 1855, to
thirty-seven million acres. ' In the case of one of the tribes if
the treaty were considered to create a technical reservation it
would have allotted to each man, woman, and child in the tribe
more than eighteen square miles.

The Department of the Interior, as is evidenced by the patents

issued, has consistently treated” the lands in question as included

Indians‘ right of occupancy; were within the grant made by the Act

the obligation of extinguishing the Indian title in favor of the

company.

Bathing is here said that in any way is contrary to the holdings of
the Court of Claims as respects the Government's recognition of the

Indians‘rights to occupy the territories‘ of the respective tribes as

that treaty did not create "technical reservations as have many other
treaties and acts of Congress.“ Of this there can be no dispute, but in
our opinion there is nothing here to bolster the Government's position
that there was no recognition of original Indian title in the tribes who

executed the treaty of 1851, for, as we have stated above, the creation
of a reservation is only one way in which the Government may recognize
.Indian title.

In summary, we conclude that by the treaty concluded by the
several tribes of Indians, including the Crow Tribe or Nation, and the
United States, at Fort Laramie on September 17, 1851, ll Stat. 749, the
defendant recognized the original Indian title to lands involved in

this action and_that the defendant's Second Defense, set forth in its

answer must be denied.

Pursuant to the above jurisdictional act. the Crows brought suit
and in one cause of action sought additional compensation for the
3O.53O,761&.8 acres of land ceded by the treaty of 1868 (Finding 3). The
claim was predicated upon the assertion" that because the Fort Laramie
treaty (1851), after its ratification by the Senate and the approval by
the signatory tribes of the Senate amendment, was nevencommunicated to
the State Ilepartment, the Government; at the time of negotiating and con;
cluding the 1868 treaty, labored under the erroneous belief that the 1851
treaty had never become. operative and that the Indians acquired no. rights
thereunder; that as a result of such erroneous belief the Crows were

induced to cede their land for an inadequate price.,

' "‘ "‘ We can find nothing in the evidence to show that the
Crow Indians were at any time misled as to the nature of

their holdings under the treaty of 1851. but on the contrary,
the evidence shows that they considered the reservation, so
set apart in this treaty. as their lands and in all of their _

of 1868, those speaking for the Crow Nation referred to it as

But the corn't also decided that it had no jurisdiction to consider the

Eosever. under the Jurisdictional Act. this court is confined

to claims arising under and growing out of the 1851 treaty and the
treaty of 1868; both of these treaties set out the consideration

a treaty. and that a treaty remains the Supreme law of the land
and that no court. either ‘a court of law or of equity, can .
declare a treaty to have been procured by duress and fraud and
therefore inoperative. The rights of the parties must be considered and the legal and equitable rights determined under the
terms of the treaty. We can find nothing in the evidence to

Section 1%, the decree was a bar to future é‘1a1mel_"'o:y the  for such
lands.

The argzment of the Government seems: to overlook the action of the

Court of Claims. as we have shown above. the court very plainly and

definitely'decided that it had no power under the jurisdictional act to
go behind.the treaties involved. those of 1851 and.1868, to inquire into
the adequacy of the consideration paid the Crows for the 1868 cession,
in other words, the treaty was final in.that respect. I

As we recently decided in the Choctaw case,_2 Ind. cie. c. 551, 608.
the Court of Claims determination of its jurisdiction is conclusive and
binding upon us. So here. the decision of the court that it had no power
to question the amount of consideration provided for in the 1868 treaty

is conclusive and, it may be added, we believe the court was correct in

its decision.

Therefore, the Court of Claims. as it decided. could not and did not

determine the issue of inadequacy of the consideration for‘the 1868 cession,'

and obviously the bar of the provisions of Section N of the jurisdictional
act does not apply and the Crows were faced with no impediment by that act
in presenting a claim for the value of the Crow land ceded in 1868 based
upon unconscionable consideration. in

8 It follows from the foregoing, the deiendant's affirmative defenses,
Second, Third, and Fourth, must be denied and stricken from the answer.

Witt, Chief Commissioner, concurring:
I concur in the conclusion reached.by the majority; however, I
am of the opinion that this Commission has no authority to give consideration to the facts in evidence or to make any findings of fact.
I am of the opinion that the decisions discussed by Commissioner
O‘Marr_under the heading "DECISIONS OF COURT OF CLAIMS AND SUPREME
'COUET" constitute a judicial determination that the Fort Laramie Treaty
of September 11, 1851, recognized the ownership by the respective tribes
signatory thereto, including the Crows, to the respective tracts of land
set aside to them, as he does: and that this Commission is therefore precluded from a reconsideration of the same evidence on the question of
whether or not the said treaty constituted recognition of the ownership
by the Crow Tribe, petitioner herein, of the land for which they seek
compensation.

Commissioner 0'Marr, in discussing the cases to which he refers,

says:

. In three cases the Court of Claims had occasion to consider
the treaty of September 17, 1851, Fort Laramie Treaty, and in
each directly or in effect held that by that treaty the Uhited
States confirmed original Indian title in the tribal signatories
thereto, including the Crows.

 

We shall not extend this discussion in order to determine
whether the former judgments of the Court of Claims constitute
collateral estoppel under the doctrine of res judicata or whether
those decisions are merely stare decisis. Under either rule we
would, as we must, be bound by the det'erminati_on of ‘the’ ‘co’ urt of
Claims on the facts which were before that court and are now
before us on the ouestion of original Indian title based upon the

same document, the Fort Laramie Treaty. EUnderscoring supplied5.

Qommissioner 0'Marr follows these general statements with an analysis
of each of the three cases. He expressly states that each holds that ‘by
the Treaty of Fort Laramie the United States recognized the title in the
tribal signatory thereto to the lands set apart to them, including the

CTOWS 9

He thereafter analyzes the decision of the Supreme Court in North,western Shoshone Indians vs. _United States. 321$ U. S. 335. and quotes

language therefrom which he construes as the opinion of the Supreme Court
in that decision as determining that the Fort Laramie 'i'reaty recognized
original Indian title of the lndians involved, inclu.ding_the Crows.

He then discussesthe United States vs. Northern Pacific case which
the defendant contends overruled the previous decisions. He‘ construes
the opinion in the Northern Pacific case as confirming the holdings in
the previous cases.

I agree with his construction of these several cases, and so agreeing I concur _in his statement that we e.re_bound by the determination as
made by these decisions; and as I_ stated in the beginning, ‘being bound by
said decisions, we are therefore precluded from a reconsideration of the
same evidence.

Even if we disagreed with the Court of Claims as to the effect of the
evidence upon which it bases its decisions. our view would have to give
way to that of the higher courts, so I can find; neither authority nor purpose in reviewing the facts upon which such controlling decisions are based.
