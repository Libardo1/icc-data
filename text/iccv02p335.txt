The villages which were occupied by the tribe at various times were all
located on the south side of the Platte about 30 to 34-0 miles above its_
confluence with the Missouri. The tribe was usually found in only one
village when visited by explorers and traders, but this village was not
at all times in the same place, being occasionally moved from one location to another in the same vicinity. The tribe continued. to occupy
its villages in this area and to hunt over the area between the Platte
and Great Nemaha Rivers and as far west as the line between Townships

5  6 east of the Principal Meridian, and was so occupying ‘and using
said area in Indian fashion at the time the United States purchased
Louisiana from France in 1803,  at the time of the Treaty of Prairie
du Chien on July‘ 15, 1830.

3. The plaintiff tribe also claimed an undefined area east of the ,
Missouri River over which it sometimes roamed and hunted.

A. treaty between the United States, the Sioux and Chippewa, Sac
and Fox, Menominie, Ioway, Sioux, Winnebago, and a portion of the Ottawa,
Chippewa, and Potawattomie Tribes, was concluded at Prairie dn Ghien on
August 19, 1825 (7 Stat. 272), for the purpose of promoting peace among
said tribes and establishing the boundaries between them and the other \tribes living in their vicinity. I

Article 1; of said treaty reads as follows:

his Ottoes not being represented at this Council, and
the commissioners for the United States being anxious that
_ justice should be done to all parties, and having reason

to believe that the Ottoes have a just claim to a portion

of the country upon the Missouri, east and south of the

boundary line dividing the Sacs and Eoxes and the Ioways,

from the Sioux, it is agreed between the parties interested

therein, and the United States, that the claim of the Ottoes
shall not be affected by any thing herein contained; but the

Article 11 of said treaty provided that a council should be held
the following year, 1326, -with the Ottoes, to settle and adjust their
title to any of the country claimed by the sacs, Foxes, and Ioways,“
but no such council was held, no definite ‘boundary was ever agreed upon,
and no defimte area lying east of the Missouri River is shown to have
been occupied by or recognized as the exclusive property or territory
of the plaintiff herein.

ll». Differences having arisen among some of the tribes who had been
parties to the treaty of 1825 and who resided between the Mississippi
and I-iissouris Rivers in what is now southern Minnesota, tlowa, and northern
Missouri, a council of these tribes was assembled at Prairie du Cbien,

in the month of July, 1830, the purposes of which were to compose the

differences and establish peace between said tribes, and to provide

other sources for supplying their wants besides those of hunting. This

council resulted in the negotiation of a treaty which was concluded on

July 15, ls3o (7 Stat. 323), between the United States and the sees and

Foxes, the Medawah-Kanton, Wahpacoota, Uahpeton and Sisseton Bands or

Tribes of Sioux, the omabas, Ioways, and the otoe and Missouria.
Article 1 of said treaty reads as follows:

Article 1. has said Tribes cede and relinquish to the
United States forever all their right and title to the lands
lying within the following boundaries, to wit: Beginning at
the umer fork of the Dmoine River, and passing the sources
of the Little Sioux, and Floyds Rivers, to the for}: of the
first creek which falls into the Big Sioux or calumet on the
east side; thence, down said creek, and Calumet River to the
Missouri River; thence down said Missouri River to the Hissouri State line, above the Kansas; thence along said line
to the north west corner of the said State, thence. to the
high lands between. the waters falling into the Missouri and
Demoines, passing to said high lands along the dividing ridge
7-‘>9‘W9€1l the forks Of the Grand River; thence along said high

lands or ridge separating the waters of the Missouri from
those oi‘ the Demoine, to a point opposite the source of
Boyer River, and thence in a direct line to the upper fork
of the Demoine, the place of beginning. But it is understood that the lands ceded and relinquished by this Treaty,
are to be assigned and allotted under the direction of the
President of the ‘United States, to the Tribes now living
thereon, or to such other Tribes as the ?resident may locate
thereon for hunting, and other purposes.

nus treaty was ratified by the Yankton and Santie Bands of Sioux
at St. Louis on October 13, l830. It was proclaimed rebmary 21+, 1831.

5. In addition to the lands ceded by Article 1 of said treaty,
the sacs and Foxes, by Article II, ceded to the United States some
2,000,000 acres extending from the Mississippi to the Des Moines River,
and lying south of the boundary  the Sioux as fixed by the treaty
of August 19, 1825. The four bands constituting the Sioux ‘of the Mississippi, by Article III, ceded a like area north of I said boundary.

The consideration paid and promised to the various tribes for the
cessions mde in the treaty amounted to between $50,000 and $60,000, of
which approiimately one-seyenth was to go to the plaintiff tribe.

6. At the time of the treaty of my 15, 1330, and for many years
prior thereto, the lands described.in Article 1 of said treaty were used,
occupied and hunted. over by a number of Indian tribes, including those
who were parties to said treaty, but no one tribe had exclusive possession of any definite area thereof. The lands ceded by Article 1
comprised a total area of appron‘.mtely ll,000,000 acres, of which amount l,900,000 were in Missouri; 9,000,000 in Iowa; and 100,000 in
Minnesota. It has not been established in this case that the clairant

tribe actually occupied, used or possessed, to the exclusion of other

Indian tribes, any part of the lands described in said Article 1.

this treaty of 1833 never became effective because of the failure of
the United States Senate to ratify it. Under the later treaty, cone

8 (1) . The Otoes and other tribes who were parties to the treaty

of July 15, 1830, desired to make provision for their half-breeds, and
accordingly procured. the insertion of Articles X and II in said treaty,
which read as follows;

Article I. he omahas, Ioways and Ottoes, for themselves, and in behalf of the Yanckton and Santie Bands of
Sioux, having earnestly requested that they might be permitted to rake some provision for their half-breeds, and
particularly that they might bestow upon them the tract of
country within the following limits, to wit; Beginning at
the mouth of the Little Ne-mohaw River, and running up the
min channel of said River to a point which will be ten
miles from its mouth in a direct line; from thence in a
direct line, to strike the Grand Ne-mohaw ten miles above
its mouth, in a direct line (the distance between the two
Ne—mohavs being about twenty miles)-thence down said
River to its mouth; thence up, and with the Heanders of
the Hissouri River to the point of beginning, it is agreed
that the half-breeds of said Tribes and Bands may be
suffered to occupy said tract of land; holding it in the
same manner, and by the same title that other Indian titles
are held; but the President of the United States may hereafter assign to any of the said half-breeds, to be held by
him or them in fee simple, any portion of said tract not
exceeding a section, of six hundred and forty acres to
each individual. And this provision shall extend to the
cession. made by the Sioux in the preceding Article.

_.£1'ticle XI. The reservation of land mentioned in the

F preceding Article having belonged to the Ottoes, and having
been exclusively ceded by them; it is agreed that the Onahas,
the Iouays and the Ianckton and Santie Bands of Sioux shall
pay out of their annuities to the said ottoe Tribe, for the
period of ten years, Three hnndred Dollars annually; of
which sum the whee shall pay one hundred Dollars, the
Ionays one hundred Dollars, and the Yanckton and Santie
Bands one hnndred. dollars.

8 (2). 'ihe half-breeds of the omahas, Ioways, Yankton and Santie
E-I3-is of $1001, and of the Otoe and Missouria Tribe thus became invested
with the title to the tract of land described in Article X. The United
States consented to this cession to the half-breeds and thereafter acted
as trustee for them, holding and allotting said lands to them, but the

record does not show that the United States requested or suggested that
the Otoes cede any part of their lands to the half-breeds, but merely
acceded to the desire of the Indians and thereafter acted as trustee
for the half-breeds, holding and aILLotting the mjor portion of the
Lands to them, and paying them for the shortage in said lands caused by
an erroneous survey as set forth in a later finding.

8 (3). Lands to the extent of 93,861-L62 acres were allotted and
patented to the half-breed Onahas, Ioways, Yankton and Santie Sioux.
Patents were also issued to the half-breeds of the Otoe and Missouria
Tribe in the same proportion, according to their numbers, as were issued
to those of the other tribes. A total of 389 patents were issued. The
plaintiff tribe received the $3,000 which was paid by the other tribes
as provided in said treaty. The United States received no profit or
benefit from the lands ceded to the half-breeds. The cession to the
half-breed.was a transaction among the tribes named, at their request.

9. ‘Ehe lands ceded by plaintiff tribe for the use and benefit of
the half-i-breed nembers of the various tribes as set out in the preceding findings were surveyed in 1838 by John C. Mccoy, who had been
employed and authorized by the defendant hereinuto maize said survey.
This survey was erroneous in that it failed to place the western boundary of the cession as far west as was provided in the treaty. This
error caused the reservation, as surveyed, to contain 15,697 acres
less than the area called for by the treaty. This error was disclosed
by a resurvey of the reservation in 1855', while malcing preparation for
its allotment to the half-breeds. By the act of June 12, 1858 (ll Stat.

319), the line surveyed by McCoy as the western boundary of the halft.- ‘ _. '._ . .

breed tract was declared to be and was established as the true western

boundary of said tract. By the act of February 28, 1859 (11 stat. LL01),

Congress authorized an adjustment of the claim of the half-breeds for
‘the shortage of land which resulted from the erroneous survey and directed that they should be compensated at the rate of $1.25 per acre

for such deficiency. Thereafter, by act of March 3, 1363 (12 stat.

_'{92), Congress appropriated the sum of $19,621.27, which was $1.25 per”

acre for the 15,697 acres which had been excluded from the half-breed
reservation by the erroneous survey of Mccoy. The half-breed Indians
received allotments of all the lands included in their reservation as
surveyed by Mccoy, and were paid for that part‘ of the land described
in the treaty but which had not been included insaid survey—that is,
the 15,697 acres.

10. The land ceded by the Otoe and Missouria Indians to the halfbreeds by the traty of July .15, 1830, was at the time recognized and
acmowledged by all the parties to said treaty as belonging to the
Otobs andas being exclusively ceded by them. This tract was further
from the villages of the Otoes than the lands ceded by treaty of
September 21, 1833, or by treaty of March 15, 1851!. The lands ceded
by the treaty of 1833 adjoined the half-breed reservation on its west.
She lands ceded by the treaty of l85’-L lay between the northern boundary of the l833 cession and the Platte River in Nebraska.

of July l5, lS30, as the point of beginning; thence up the

Thence on a direct line West to the Range Line lying between Range 5 East and 6 nest of the Principal Meridian;
thence South on said Range Line to the Great Nemaha River;
thence down said Great bremha River to the Southwest
corner of the Nemaha half-breed reservation as defined
in Article X of the Treaty of July 15, 1830, to the point

of beginning .

The United States has paid the otoe and Missouria Tribe the sum of
$39,1l»l0 .15 under the provision of said 1833 treaty.

12 (1). By the treaty of March 15, 1351; (10 Stat . 1038), the Otoe
and I-{issouria Tribe relinquished all claim which they had theretofore
at any time made to any land on the east sidelof the Missouri River; and
also by Article I of said treaty ceded to the United States all their
remaining lands west of the Missouri River,

¢ '3 '3 excepting a strip of land on the waters of the
Big Blue River, ten miles in width and bounded as follows;
commencing at a point in the middle of the Main branch of
the Big Blue River, in a west or southwest direction from
Old Fort Kearney, at a place called by the Indians the
'Islands;' thence west to the western boundary of the

' country hereby ceded; thence in a northerly course with

said western boundary, ten miles; thence east to a point
due north of the starting point and ten-miles therefrom;
thence to the place of beginning; Provided, That in case
the said initial point is not within the limits of the
country hereby ceded, or that the western boundary oi‘
said country is not distant twenty-five miles or more
from the initial point, in either case, there shall be
assigned by the United States to said Indians, for their
future home, a tract of land not less than ten miles wide
by twenty-five miles long, the southeast corner of which
tract shall be the initial point above named. And such
portion of such tract, if any, as shall prove to be outside of the ceded country, shall be and the same is hereby granted and ceded to the confederate tribes of Ottoe
and Missouria Indians by the United States, who will have
said tract properly set off by durable monuments as soon

after the ratification of this instrument as the same can
conveniently be done.

12 (2). 0n'Decem'oer 9, 1851}, a treaty (10 Stat. 3.130) supplementary to the foregoing treaty of March 15, 1851}, -was concluded between the muted states and the otoe and!-Iissouria. Tribe wherein it
was recited that, upon exploration by the tribe of the reservation
provided by the March 15, 1851+ treaty, it was found that they had been
mistaken as to the location thereof and that the larger portion--nearly
the entirety-—of it was to the west of the Big Blue River, was without
sufficient timber, and they were dissatisfied. ‘Bo remove all cause of
complaint, it was agreed that the initial point of the reservation (in
lieu of that stated in the I-€arch.l5, 1351+ treaty) should be a point
five miles due east thereof, thence west twenty—five miles, thence
north ten miles, thence .east to a point due north of the starting
point and ten miles therefrom, thence to the place of beginning; and
that the country embraced within said boundaries should be taken and
considered‘as the reservation and home of said tribes in lieu of that
provided for  and described in the prior l853-l- treaty. ‘litls entire
area so described was outside the area of the cession made in the
March 15, lS51L treaty.

12 (3) . The parties hereto have filed a formal stipulation and
agreement fixing the boundaries of the cession mde under the March l5,
1853+ treaty, and establishing the acreage contained therein as 1,250,000
acres. The reservation provided in the aforesaid treaties, when surveyed, was found to contain 162,107.71 acres. The total consideration
paid under and by virtue of the provisions of the treafw of March 15,
1853+, for the cession and relinquishment was $L',63,1L23 .714. There is

no evidence from which it can be determined what amount, if any, was

in payment for the relinquishment of the claim of the Indians to the
lands east of the Missouri River. .At the time, the game in this area
had been practically exhausted and was of little value. The‘United
states assigned this land east of the Missouri River to the Potawattomie Tribe of Indians for a. home under the treaty of September 26,
1833 (7 Stat. #31), and it was thereafter occupied by that tribe until
settled by the whites.

13. .At the time of the treaties of September 2l, lS33, and
March 15, 185%, no other Indian tribe or band was occupying or using
or claiming the lands which were ceded by said treaties, and the

neighboring tribes recognized said lands as the rightful and ex‘elusive hunting grounds of the Otoe and Missouria Indians.

commissioner Ellsworth, who negotiated the treaty of September
21, 1833, in his report on said treaty to the Commissioner of Indian
.Af£airs, stated.that he had found the Indian title to the land ceded
to be good in the Otoe and Missouria Indians. The eminent historian,
.Dr; B. 3. Chapman, who has made a special study of the Otoe and Missouria
Tribe, says that the Otoe and.Missouria Tribe possessed the area ceded
by them in the treaty of l833 to the exclusion of all other tribes;
that no other Indian tribe or tribes claimed any part of this area;
and that the adjoining tribes recognized and respected the Otoe and
Missouria ownership thereof.

In his work entitled !An Introduction to Pawnee.Archeology,'
Dr. Ealph Waldo Wedel says:

3 * *. om.the east the Omaha controlled a large

area north of the Platte from Shell creek to the mouth
of the Eiobrara, and south of the Platte the Oto claimed

of the Big Nemaha. * * *

Early explorers, Charlevoiz: in 1821, Choteau in 1816, Major Long
in 1820, placed the plaintiff tribe as the exclusive users in Indian fashion of the territory ceded by the treaties of September 21, 1833,
and I-larch 15, 1851:.

George W. Manypenny, commissioner of Indian Affairs, reporting to
the Secretary of the Interior on the date of November 26, 1853, quotes
James M. Gatet-rood, Indian Agent, as saying in his report of October 16,
1853, among other things, that Hthe otoe and Missouria, a confederated
tribe that owned the country on the west side of the Missouri and ertending from the Great Nebraska (Platte River) to the Little Nemaha
have been reduced by a combination of circumstances over‘ which they
have no control to a state of poverty and suffering, etc. * * * * ".
These Indians have been induced of late years to rely less upon hunting
and more upon the products of the soil for their support. With that
object in view,'they concluded a treaty on the 31st day of September,
1833, with the United States, for ‘the sale of a large and valuable
tract of country lying to the south of the Little Nemaha, and trestwa.rdly to their western boundary.‘

11!». The tract ceded under the treaty of September 21, 1833, as
described in Finding ll, contains 792,000 acres of land for which the
Indians received the sum of $39 ,1!-10 .15-—being 34.9 cents per acre. We
find that this land hada value of 75 cents per acre at the date it
was ceded to the United States on September ?_1, 1833.

The consideration the otoe and Missouria Tribe received for said land was grossly

inadequate and constituted an unconscionable consideration.

15. Ehe tract of land west of the Missouri River ceded by the
Otoe and 1-iissouria Tribe to the United states under the treaty of
March 15, 1851!», contained 1,250,000 acres (rinding 12 (3)); the area
reserved by the plaintiff tribe in said treaty proved to be located
outside of the ceded area, and the area supplied by the defendant
for the reservation constituted 162,107 .71 acres. By reason thereof,
the defendant received by the cession a net of 1,087,892.29 acres of
land from the otoe  Missouria Tribe.

16. The Gomission finds the value of the land coded by the 1851}
treaty to have been $1.00 per acre at the timeof the cession, or
$1,087 .892 .29 .

17. The plaintiff tribe received the total sum of $1!-63,1$23 .71!»
from the United states under and by virtue of the provisions of the
March 15, 18514 treaty. This  my not, in a strict sense, be so
grossly inadequate as to constitute an unconscionable consideration
for !the land coded by the treaty; however, taking into consideration
all the facts and circumstances as disclosed by the record, the payment
by the defendant of such an inadequate consideration for the ceded land
and relinquishment as all rights in land east of the Missouri River was

unquestionably unfair and resulted in an injustice to the plaintiff

tribe.

18. Sale of 120,000 acres of plaintiff‘ s reservation ms authorized by act of Congress of 1376 (19 stat. 209). 3. M. Barnes, a
member of plaintiff tribe, was appointed one of the ayaisers at the

request of the tribe to evaluate the land to be sold. The secretary

31 ad... I

of the Interior appointed two others as appraisers.

Ihe lands selected for sale aggregated 119 ,8}-L6 .17 acres and were
appraised as having the value of $427,091.33, or $3.56 an acre. The
sum of $152,262.73 was received by the otoe and Missouria for this
tract, or approximately $3 .85 per acre.

19, mr act of congress of March 3, 1881 (21 stat. 380), authorization was granted. for the appraisal and sale of the remainder (being 143,051 acres) of the plaintiff!s reservation. on May 1%, 1881,

I the otoe and Missouria Indians in council agreed to the sale of said

remainder of said reservation and again appointed Francis M. Barnes

' as the appraiser to represent the Indians. The 15,051 acres were duly

appraised as of the value of $258,276.10, or an average oi‘ $5 .08 per
acre, of which 112,261.53-L acres were sold for the aggregate sum of
$516,851.52, or an average oi‘,$l2.22 per acre.

33. Ihe appraisal and sale of the lands hereinabove described

were fairly performed and the interests of the Indians protected by

!
rrancis M. Barnes, the appraiser chosen by the Indians to represent

thm, and by the agents of the defendant.

21. (l). The act of I-Sarch 3, 1881 (21 Stat. 380), authorizing
sale of the reminder of plainti:£f?s reservation lands was agoved
by the Indians on May 14- of the same year. Although this act contained
no provision directing the sale to be made at public auction, the commissioner of Indian Affairs recommended that the lands be sold upon
deferred payments as per terms of the act, and "to the highest bidder
who is a qualified purchaser.“ This recommendation was adopted by

the Secretary of the Interior, who instructed the commission of the

General land office to proceed with the sale after due advertisement

to the highest responsible bidder upon deferred payments in accordance
with the provisionsof the act of l88l. The lands were to be sold in
tracts not exceeding 80 acres each, and no purchaser could purchase
more than 160 acres. ‘Ho lands could be sold at less than the appraised
value. The purchaser was required to pay one—fourth in cash and the
remainder in three annual payments with interest thereon at five per
cent per annnm. '

a (2). In accordance with these instructions, the sale was set
for May 31, 1883, and was advertised in a number of newspapers in
eastern Kansas and Hebrew; The sale attracted large crowds and the
bidding was spirited. Theland had been appraised at an average of
$6 .08 per acre and was sold at an average of $12 .22 per acre. About
half of those who were the high bidders at -this first sale failed to

comply with requirements of the Land office, and a second sale was

advertised for December 10 , 1833, at which the successful bidder was
required to make payment of one-fourth of the purchase price upon

acceptance of his bid.
21 (3). Many of the purchasers failed to make their payments

of principal and interest when the first of their deferred payments
fell due, and began to petition congress for extensions of time and
other forms of relief , alleging that the lands had been ‘sold for more
than they were worth, and that they had ‘been promised relief from
excessive prices at the time of their purchases.

Z1. (1!-). By act of March 3, lS8’9', the Congress extended the time

for making final payments for a term of two years. Again, by the act

of August 2, 1885, the Congress granted an additional extension of two
years. Both of these acts were passed without consulting the wishes
of the Indians. These two extensions, taken together, ran to April 30,
1889. The act of August 2, 1886, provided that the interest then due
on the deferred payments should be paid annually "at the time said
payments are now due." However, nearly 12 years lat er, there were 1214purchasers who were in default, only 213» of whom had paid any interest
whatever.

22 (1). By the act of March 3, 1393 (27 Stat. 568), the Congress
mthorized and directed the ‘secretary of the Interior to adjust the amounts due by the purchasers by allowing rebates of the amounts paid
or agreed to be paid by them which were in excess, of the appraised
value of the lands purcknsed by them, "the consent of the Indians
having first been obtained." The Indians were convened in council on
Jamnary 3, -1895, by commissioners appointed to obtain their consent,
but refused to agree to any rebate whatever from the amounts for
whibh their lands were originally sold. The Land Office at Lincoln,
Rebraska, at the direction of the ‘Secretary of the Interior, notified
the delinquents that they would be granted. 90 days in which to pay the
principal, and interest due by them, or have their entries cancelled.
Shortly thereafter, on November 9, 1895, the Secretary of the Interior
directed the G-eneral Land. Office to take no further action looking to
the cancellation of the entries.

22 (2). In the year 1896 strenuous efforts were continued, both
in and out of congress, to devise some plan of settlement to satisfy

the purchasers which the Indians would accept. These efforts resulted

in a proposition of settlement by which only the settlers who were in

default should. have 10 years’ interest rebated if they would pay the
balance due by them in 90 days. This proposition was accepted by the
Indians in council on June 3, l896, and siged by a rajority of the
tribe. on December 20, 1896, the Assistant Attorney General ruled.
that if this proposed rebate should be granted to the purchasers who
were in default, that a like rebate would have to be granted to those

purchasers who had already paid in full. Following this ruling, bills

were introduced in congress providing for rebate to the purchasers of .

all money paid or contracted to be paid for the lands in excess of the
appraised values as determined in 1883. Ellis. bill was passed in the
Senate on February 11, 1898, over the vigorous protest of ‘the Office
of Indian Affairs, but was finally defeated in the House of Representativzes.

22 (3) . On February 20, 1899, the House committee on Indian
Affairs introduced a bill providing for certain rebates and deductions,
on which the Indians were to be heard, but which did not require their
consent.

22 (1%). While this bill was still pending, attorneys for the
purchasers presented a new proposition to the secretary of the Interior,
the terms of which were all for the benefit of the purchasers. This
proposition was submitted to the Indians on August ll, 1899, and was
by them rejected. They then addressed a vigorous letter to the
secretary of the Interior, protesting the granting of extensions and

rebates, and calling attention to the fact that all the extensions

given the purchasers by Congress had been granted without the consent

of the Indians.
22 (5). After the Indians had rejected the aboveproposal,

secretary of the Interior man, in .September,_ l899, directed Indian Inspector James McLaughlin to negotiate with the purchasers in
an effort to have them submit an offer to which the Indians would
give their consent. Mclazlgblin entered into negotiations with

the purchasers who were in arrears and ultimately secured from
them a proposal to pay the appraised value of their lands, plus
one-fourth of the net value, with simple interest at five per

cent per annum on the adjusted price from date of purchase, credits
to be given for all payments mde by the purchasers with ‘interest
from the dates of such payments.

22 (6). inspector Mclalghlin then proceeded to the submission
of such proposal to said Indians. He cellei a council of the Indians for November 20, 1899 , and presented this proposed compromise
settlement to them, fully explaining  Interpreters Shunatona
and Dervin, both members of the ‘tribe. '.Ehe Indians did not ratify
the proposed. settlement at their first meeting, and Mozaighlin
called them into council from day to day for several days. The
document accepting the proposed settlement was ultimately signed

by ‘[3 of the 88 adnlt male members of said tribe.
22 (7). The congress, by the act of April ll», 1900, approved and

confirmed the above settlement as a revision and adjustment of the

sales of the late reservation of the otoe and Missouria Tribe of Indian

It has been stipulated herein that this settlement resulted. in a re?
bate to the delinquent purchasers in the amount of $l68,'{81L.08, which
was due the Indians on July 1, 1900, on ‘basis of original sales contracts.

2‘ (8). Inspector Mclaughlin, in transmitting saidproposed settlement to the secretary of the Interior, wrote in this letter of December 9,
1899, with reference to the same, as follows:

The price at which the lands mere bid- in at the time

of sale was, in most instances, very high and undoubtedly

much above the market value ofwild lands in that section

of country at the time, and as the proposition of the

settlers for a compromise settlement has been accepted by

the Indians as per the enclosed Agreement, and the purchase

price agreed upon for the lands of the delinquent purchasers being, in my opinion, a fair and reasonable compromise

settlement, giving the Indians good value for the lands and

equitably adjusting the cost of same to the settlers, and

which will end this long standing and’ perplexing matter, I

therefore respectfully recommend approval of the Agreement.

22 (9). senator Hitchcock, chairman of the senate committee on Indian Affairs, recomended the approval of this settlement to Congress, and
on March 12, 1900, the bill passed the Senate, without debate, and thereafter passed the House on April 11» by vote of 101% to 13. Dennis T. Flynn,
a delegate from Oklahoma Territory, in whose district the Otoe and
Missouria Indians were then living, urged the mssage of the bill, stating,
among other things, nxf we hang up this settlement it is uncertain whether
the Indians will ever get the money.“

22 (10). In a. letter to the Secretary of the Interior of date M8-3'
l5, 1912, James McLaughlin, the Indian Inspector, stated that said settlement proposal was fully discussed in his presence by a. delegation of Otoe

and Hissouria in December, 1899, and that the delegates expressed their

full concurrence therein, and he again stated that the Indians had entered

¢-- —b -——--&'-4--u-:§--I-un_n¢-.a .--us...

into the compromise settlement with full knowledge and consent after

a thorough understanding by them of the provisions thereof.

22 (11). Approximately one-half of the signers of the compromise settlement ‘understood the English language and themselves signed
their names thereto, among them being Richard W. S}n1natona, who had
been selected. by_ the Indians as their special interpreter, and Mitchell
Dervin, the official interpreter, both being members of the tribe.
lhey also signed. a certificate to the instrument certii‘ying that they
had fully and carefully interpreted all that passed between the Indian Inspector (uczanghiin) and said Indians, and that the Indians
thoroughly understood the nature of the subject matter in controversy;
and that the Indians had signed same of their own free will and volition

23.
November 20, 1899, were understood by the Indians, one that they

we find that the terms of the compromise settlement of

executed the same of their oun free will and volition.
