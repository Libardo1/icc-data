p with the treaty were issued, for 5,926.22 acres of the Saginaw Reservation lands.

‘Under the provisions of‘Article 3 of the Treaty of October 18, _].~_8_61!-,
114 Stat. 657, Saginaw members who made selections in the Saginaw Reservation were given the right to make selections in Isabella Reservation in .
lieu of selections previously made in the Saginaw Reservation, and se-,
lections aggregating 5600 acres were accordingly made in Isabella Reservation. 3

Therefore, deducting from the total acreage of 98,051.13 withdrawn S.
from sale for the benefit of the Saginaw by the 1855 treaty, the selected
acreage of 27,931.80 (Finding 12), plus the 5600 lieupland selections referred to "in the last preceding paragraph, there remained in Isabella
Reservation 634,519.33 acres "for the exclusive use, ownership, and
occupancy of the said Chippewas of Saginaw, Swan Creek and Black River” '
(Art. -2, Treaty of 1861:), and which lands were available for individual
selections "by members of thesaginaw under the provisions of Article 3

of the 1864 treaty after satisfying the lien land selection mentioned
above in this finding.

11%. By the provisions of Article 1 of the 1855 treaty, the Saginaw
were__ given five years from July 1, 1856. to make selections (Finding 3)
and five years thereafter within which to purchase (enter) the unselected

to enteruand pay for the 70,119.33 acres of unselected lands in Isabella.

Reservation and 574,667.01 acres of unselected lands in the Saginaw Reservation.
