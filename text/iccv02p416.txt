OPINION

E WITT, Chief Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Comission;

The Claim in ‘this docket number is _briefly_ stated  the plaintiff in its brief as follows:

This is an action for an accounting of the proceeds
of the sale of 102,400 acres of land ceded to defendant
in trust by the treaty executed at Detroit on January 14,
1837, ratified July 2, 1838 (7 Stat. 538, 2 Kapp. 482),
and supplement correcting mistake in description. De- ,
fendant has failed and refused to account for the proceeds
of the sale of 60,124.41 acres of this land, which could
not be sold for less than $2.50 per acre. (5 Stat. 680;
Def. Ex. 1, p. l6). Claim is now made against defendant

The defendant alleges that by Article 3 of the treaty of

’ “Q August 2, 1855, and supplements thereto, (meaning the treaty of

-lg.:.T } October 18, 1864) it was released and discharged from.further lia.I._. ‘at

h_p% bility to account for the value 6f the remaining unsold lands (which

. ‘Inn

. filxif had been ceded to the defendant in trust by the treaty of January 14,

'.’”4 1837); and that the items aggregating $13,195.49 claimed as having

'i::1'Ff§ been erroneously charged to the plaintiff were properly charged to

3 the plaintiff, and as to which defendant should not be held liable;

or defendant's liability therefor, if any, offset by refunds due
it, or released by.Article 3 of the 1855 treaty.

The plaintiff contends that the release agreed to by the
Indians under.Article 3 of the treaty of.August 2, 1855, is unconscionable because the defendant has plead said release as a defense to other claims of the plaintiff based on prior treaties, the

pendency of whihh said claims and the defense urged thereto the Commission should take judicial notice of; plaintiff contending that

they "have elected to have the consideration specified in said treaty

of 1855 credited against the claims under the earlier treaties as

revised, commencing with the earliest in which recovery is had."
Defendant contends that the validity of the release must be

ascertained as it applies to each case before the Commission. The

question of the sufficiency of the consideration given by the Treaty

of.August 2, l855, for the release of claims based on treaties arising

prior to 1837 cannot now'be determined by the Commission for the facts

pertaining to those claims are not now ih evidence.

f

however, in this case to test the sufficiency of the release as it

It is possible,

specifically applies to the case herein at bar. The Commission is of
the opinion that the defendant's contention as to said release is
sustained, and that the determination of whether or not the release

discharges the defendant from.liability to the plaintiff for the value

of the 60,l2h.hl acrescof land unsold at the time of the treaty of l855

determination of the consideration received by the plaintiff under
the terms of the treaty of l8SS as contrasted with the value of the
cessions and relinquishments made by the plaintiff under the terms
of said treaty. i

The plaintiff makes the contention that the release should be
considered as applicable not only to the cessions and benefits specifically named in the treaty of 1855 as conveyed and released, but that

isame should be considered as applicable to the claimed liability of the

defendant to the plaintiff for the value of approximately 690,000 acres

;?%EDx of land ceded by'the plaintiff to the defendant by the treaty of July h,
‘ aé l805, for an unconscionable consideration; and for the reasonable value

: of approximately 2,620,800 acres of land ceded to the defendant for an

unconscionable consideration by the treaty of November 17, l807; and
of the liability for the reasonable value of approximately h,326,23O
acres of land ceded to the defendant by the treaty of September 2h,

l8l9, for an unconscionable consideration. (See Plaintiff*s Requested

f fdf Finding No. l2). Aside from.the fact that at the time of the treaty

of 1855 there existed no liability in law to the plaintiff for cessions
made for an unconscionable consideration, if any, and therefore the
plaintiff having no claim.of such character against the defendant at

the time, certainly a release, even if broad enough to cover all lia:'? bilities at the time of whatever nature, cannot'be considered as having

in contemplation the release of liabilities not then in existence.

It is further to be noted that the release provided by the
treaty of l8SS describes the claims to be released as those which

are “legal and equitable *-* * against the United States for land,

money and other thing guaranteed to said tribes, or either of them,

bw'the stipulations of any former treaty or treaties." (Underscoring
supplied). .

Under the Findings ofWFact (Finding no. ll), under the treaties
of 1855 and 186k (which l86h treaty merely'supplemented the 1855 treaty
as far as benefits accruing to the Indians is concerned), the Saginaw
Indians received individual allotments and patents to lands aggregating
more than 98,000 acres, and also money or expenditures in lieu of money
for their benefit in the aggregate amount of $252,000. If all the

‘annuities and benefits accruing to the Chippewa Indians under previous

treaties (as shown by Finding No. l2) are held to have been the property’
of the Saginaw Chippewas, and they are credited with capitalization of
all said annuities and benefits at the rate of six percent, they can
be credited with surrendering benefits of the cash value of $96,666.66.
crediting this on the net expenditure of $252,000 accruing to said
plaintiff would leave a net money consideration received by the Indians,
over and above that surrendered by them, of $lSS,333,3h.

If the Saginaw Tribe is not to be credited with all said an.nu.'.ties"
and benefits under the treaties named in Finding No. &2, but only for
those whichnare a fixed and definite obligation of the defendant to

said Indians, then they would have a credit of approximately $80,000

Under no basis of calculation of the value of benefits

;;§:}, released as compared with benefits received, applying same to the

moneys involved, can it be said that the plaintiff received less than

$lSS,333.3h in.excess of the benefits; which amount exceeds the value

of land ceded as claimed by the plaintiff in the amount of $150,311.03.
It is also to be noted that the Indians received individual allotments under the treaties of l8SS and 186k of over 98,000 acres of

en!

public land of the United States.
Summarizing the provisions of the treaty of 1855, as to the

benefits accruing to the United States thereby, they are:

(l) Full title to the lands unsold of the l02,h00 acres previously

amount of such unsold lands being approximately 60,l2h.hl acres.

said treaty to individual members of the Saginaw Tribe over 98,000
acres of land.

(2) The defendant further agreed to give the Saginaw Indians
$220,000 and to expend for their benefit $32,000, providing a total
money consideration to said Indians of $252,000.

As previously stated, under no basis of calculation can the
plaintiff be held to have received a less consideration for the 60,l2h.hl
acres of land conveyed by them to the defendant than $lSS,333.3h, which
is in excess of the liability asserted by the plaintiff against the
defendant on account of the conveyance of said land to the defendant.
in addition to this excess consideration in money received by the
plaintiff, they also received individual allotments of land in excess
of 98,000 acres. Therefore, plaint' f’s claim for the land cession must be disalloned.

as found by us in Findings Nos. l3, lb and l5, the items aggregating $l3,l9S.h9 sued for by the plaintiff as being items erroneously
charged against them.by the defendant were properly so charged because
of the provisions of the treaties involved; or were offset by refunds
due to the defendant; or if not properly charged to the plaintiff, or
offset by suchrrefunds due the defendant, were in any event released
by Article 3 of the treaty of l8SS. Therefore, plaintiff is not

entitled to recover as to said items, or as to any one of the same.
