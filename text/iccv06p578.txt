ADDITIONAL FINDINGS pg FACT

 

The Commission makes the following findings of fact which are
supplemental to the findings numbered 1 to 17, inclusive, heretofore

made herein:

13. The boundaries of the lands which the Commission found the

Nooksack Tribe held ‘under original Indian title in 1859, are set out
in Finding lb. The described area contains 80,590 acres of land, inC1‘-‘ding the Nooksack River bed. For convenience these lands will sometimes be referred to as the Nook:-3ack tract.

The Commission, in findim that the Nooksack lands were taken by
the defendant as of Harch 8, 1859, further found (Finding 17) there was
evidence that some Eooksack Indians may have acquired certain rights
Subsequent t0 1859 in a part of said lands, but the character and extent of such rights and how they were acquired were not shown by the
record.

No further evidence having been offered on this question at

the hearings completed on September 224, 1957, on the issue of value

6 S'{{.

l‘'‘'''. '

of the Nooksack tract, the entire acreage in the tract, 80,590 acres,
is to be valued as of the date of taking.

19. The Nooksack tract is located 9 to 22 miles northeast of
Bellingham Bay, on Puget Sound, in Whatcom County in the present State
of Washington. The northwest corner of this triangular tract of land
is 3% miles south of the Canadian border. The northern boundary of
the tract extends between the towns of Lynden on the west and Maple
Falls on the east for a distance of 17 miles on a line approximately
parallel to the Canwian border. This northern line crosses the
Sumas ‘Mountains and ranges from an elevation of 95 feet above sea level
at the western end to elevations of about 2500 feet across the Sumas
Mountain crests. The east line extends from Maple Falls southwest to
the town of Acme, a. distance of about 15 miles, crossing the foothills
Of the Cascade Mountains and rising to an elevation of 2200 feet. The
west line from Acme northwest to Lynden is approximately 19 miles,
crossing a range of mountains at an elevation of 3000 feet during the
first 8 miles and the remaining ll niles pass over relatively flat
terrain. 0 The Nooksack River and its forks run through the Nooksack tract.
The northwestern portion of the tract has a relatively smooth topography while the central section is mountainous with sharp rises to
an altitude Of 3000 feet above sea level. 0 The eastern section of‘. the
tract contains a fertile valley along the Nooksack River and the south
fork of the River mmich valley rises gradually to elevations of 1500

t0 2000 feet in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. Approximately

6 579+ *

115% of the Nooksack tract is rough and mountainous. The Nooksack

River bed and gravel bars along the river account for 855 of the tract.

The remainder of the tract ranges from level to gently sloping and

occasional steep areas.

The climate of the area is controlled by the moderating influences of the Pacific Ocean. The winters are mild and the summers

cool. There is an abundance of rain providing for a damp climate
during the entire year with the exception of a relatively dry period
during July and August.

20. The slowness of settlement of the Puget Sound area prior to
the l880’s can be attributed to its physical inaccessibility and the

lack of transportation facilities. As of 1859 all the communities. of
western Washington were virtually dependent upon water transportation.

At that time there were no roads nor railroads in the area. The construction of railroads west of the Mississippi was delayed until sufficient funds were available, which funds generally were derived from

the sale of lands granted the railroad. The first transcontinental

rail service was to California in 1869. The Northern Pacific railroad to the West Coast was completed in 1883 and did not :reach the

Puget Sound area until 1887.

21. By Act of Congress the Territory of Oregon was established on
August 111. 13118 (9 Stat. 323). This territory included the present
states of Oregon, Washington and Idaho. The Territory of Washington
was created by the Act of Congress of March 2, l8S3 (10 Stat. 172) and

included the present states of Washington and Idaho. The Act of

6580.

6 581.1%:

March 3 , 1863 (12 Stat. 808) created the Territory of Idaho and established the eastern boundary of the present State of Washington. On
November 11, 1889, ‘i‘5as'fnington was admitted to the Union as a state.

22. In 1852 the first settlers reached Bellingham Bay located
about 9 miles from the Nooksack tract. The first claim in tm
Bellingham Bay area under the Donation Act of 1850 was filed in 1853.
That claim, of l29..E;z3 acres, was 12 miles west of the 1‘-Iooksack tract.
Some fifteen other settlers filed claims during 1853-=~1551.h

Whatcom County was established in 1851; and included the area now
divided in Whatcom, Sizagit and San Juan counties. In 1860, the population of the T:Iashi_ngton Territory was '_L'L,93}J and of Whatcom County,
352. The 1870 census gave the population of 1:"hatcom County as 5314.

The first settlers arrived in the Nooksack area in 1861 and
settled in Lynden. The town of Lynden was established in 1870; Acme
in 1887; and Van Zanziiz in 1892.

Timber

 

23. The Puget Sound area lies in a band of heavy timber which
covers virtually the entire area west of the Cascade Mountains. In
fact reports indicate that nearly 9/l0ths of E-'ashington‘s timber is in
that area. The Douglas fir forms about 7/ 8ths of the forests’ growth.
There is also valuable timber such as red cedar and hemlock. In 1899,
H9111’? Gannett, Chief of the Division of Geography and Forestry for the
Department of the Interior, reported that "with the exception of the
redwoods of California, the forests of Washington are the densest.

heaviest: and most cortinuous in the United States. Except for a few

prairie openings, ‘and except where removed by fire or the ax, they
cover the country as a thick mantle from high up on the Cascade Range
westward to the shore of the Pacific." He reported that he found the
forests of the western section of Whatcom Counw, which would include
the Nooksack tract, to be from 75 to 100% of red fir, with 10 to 2553
hemlock and 10 to 25% cedar. As to Whatcom County, he stated:

This eastern mountainous half of the country has a light
stand of timber. The western half was originally heavily
timbered. Its forests were probably as dense as those of
any other county in the State, but they have been almost
entirely destroyed by fire. Certain areas along the coast,
on Nooksack River and on Bellingham Bay and British Columbia
Railroad, have been logged, but the amount is small as compared with that destroyed by fire. T

214. Virtually all reports concerning the early life in the settlement of the Puget Sound area refer to forest fires in the area. While
it is not possible, from the available evidence, to as’certa.in the dates
of any such fires in the Nooksack tract, it appears that fires did
much damage to the forests of the area, even prior to the arrival of

white settlers. There are reports of the Indians setting great broadcast fires to keep down undergrowth so they could see the game, and
to improve the growth of berry patches. There were reports of great
forest fires throughout the Cascades in 181.19, of ‘a large fire in the
terril-701"'Y 5-T1 1855 and again in 1857. The Nooback area General Land
office surveys, which were made in the l870‘s, 1880's, and 1890's,
contain frequent references to burned out areas. The Township ho,
Range )4 East, surveyed in 1871;, which includes a portion of the north

31‘ 99- Of the Noolcsack tract, was described by the surveyor:

6582:

-39 it -3’: Timber is about all killed by fires, there not being
more than a section of the township unburned. The township East of this lies in the mountains, and the timber
being all destroyed by fire, is entirely worthless.

The surveyor described Township Lo, North, Range 5 East, surveyed in

1891 (the south two tiers of sections being in the Nooksack tract)

as follows :

This township has all been burnt over in the last 20 or

30 years except sections 36 and 35 and parts of sections

25, 31;, 1, 2, and 3.  e<- -:2

Of Township 39 North, Range 5 East, surveyed in 1890, the northeast section of the Nooksack area, the surveyor reported:

This township is very rough and broken. The only land
suitable for farming is situated in the narrow valleys
along the north and middle forks of the Nooksack River.
The balance is rough and mountainous and covered with a
dense growth of timber and brush. Most of the timber
is small and thick, there having been a fire through
most of this country years ago, and the present growth

hanng come on since, it being from twenty to thirty
feet high.

The surveyor’s notes for the areas surrounding the Nooksack tract also
make: reference to past fires having burned out large areas of timber.
25. The Nooksack River is the main drainageway of Whatcom County.
There are three forks of the river and they pass through the Cascade
Mountain foothills in the eastern part of the Nooksack tract where they
join the river then flow through the entire tract from the southeastern
portion to the northwest corner. The Nooksack was a navigable river
but portages were required around massive log jams in both upper and
lower rivers .

In 1881;, the surveyor's report on Township 39, North,

Range 11 E353 (the central and eastern portion of the Nooksack tract)

6 S83 1.:

6 584

refers to “driftwood jams which now obstruct navigation“ in the Nooksack River .

26. In the early days of our colonial history, the forests were

generally regarded as inexhaustible and were in many instances considered a liability rather than an asset, since many of the early
settlers were interested in the use of the land for agriculture and
grazing purposes and the clearing of lands for those purposes was a
burdensome and expensive process. That was the attitude of some of
the early Oregon-Washington settlers where fires were started by them
in the forests as an aid in clearing the land. However, there also
existed a recognition of the need for timber for homes and local industries as well as for shipbuilding and export. From a commercial
standpoint the lumber industry in this country had its beginning in
Maine, and gradually extended along the Atlantic seaboard and then
into the Great Lakes region in 1850. Lumbering operations of any
importance did not reach the Oregon-Washington area until about 1890
to 1900 although shipments of timber began on Puget Sound around 1850.
The earliest commercial uses made of the vast timber resources were
1'01‘ Spars and pilings. The huge trees were cut by the settlers and
dragged to the waters‘ edge to be sold and loaded on ships for trans‘portation to the world markets.
27- The first sawmill on Puget Sound was a small water-power mill

at a site named New Market, now Tum-rater, near the present city of
Olympia; Washington. In September l8S2, there were three sawmills in

Operation in what became Washington Territory. Two years later there

were thirty-three sawmills in operation in Washington Territory. In
1855 there were twenty-four sawmills in the Puget Sound area. All the
sawmills were constructed along the waters of the Sound or on the banks
of rivers whose waters could be utilized in transporting the logs as
well as providing power for the saws. The first steam plant sawmill
was Yesler’s mill built in present Seattle in the winter of 1852-3.
It had a capacity of l0,000 to 15,000 board feet per day and became
the main industry in Seattle and for years furnished employment for
the local inhabitants.

In the winter of 1852-3 a mill was built at I-Ihatcom, Bellingham
Bay (l5 miles from the Nooksack tract), is since water power failed
in the summer its capacity was 5,000 board feet per day during 1'u‘.gh
water. This was the only sawmill in Whatcom County in l860. The
first sawmill north of b'hatcom was built in 1882 on Ten Mile Creek,
five miles south of Lynden, within a few miles of the Nooksack tract.
In 15811 a sawmill was built at Ly-nden in the northwest corner of the
Nooksack tract. That mill put out 1500 board feet of lumber per day
and utilized timber from the Nooksack land. In 1889 a sawmill was y
built a few miles -west of the Nooksack tract which furnished much of.‘
the lumber used to build the city of Bellinghan during the l890’s.
The logging was done by oxen and teams hauling the lumber over a
P18-I'a_}<::%d road to Bellingham.

28. The early lumbering operations were very crude. The logging

was done by manpower. Trees were felled by ax, which was used until

the earl)’ 3-880’s when the cros-cut saw came into use. The trees were

6 585 g"

6 586

out into logs of a length which men could handle and were rolled or
dragged to the nearest water to be floated to a sawmill. Because of
the laborious operation, the timber was cut slowly. The timber first
cut was that along the waters of the Sound and those streams which
could be used to drive logs. Even as late as 1880 it was reported
that the forests along the shores of Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan
de Fuca, and the lower Columbia River had been culled only of the best
trees for a distance of only one to two miles inland. In the lJepartment of Interior's Census Office Report on the Forests of North America,

 

by Charles 5. Sargent (1881:) it is reported,

The methods adopted by the lumbermen of western
Washington territory are wasteful in the extreme.
Loggers out only timber growing within a mile or a
mile azda half of shores accessible to good booming
or shipping points or which will yield not less than
30,000 feet of lumber to the acre. Only trees are out
which will proéuee at least three logs 2L; feet long,
with a minimum diameter of; 30 inches; Trees are out
not less than l2 and often 20 feet from the ground, in
order that the labor of cutting through the thick bark
and enlarged base may be avoided, while no or 50 feet
of the top of the tree are entirely wasted.

29. In keeping with the early settlers‘ attitude toward the
liability of seemingly inexhaustible forests and his desire to clear
land, Was the feeling of the lumberman who cared little whether the
timber he 13°01‘ 1988-ll-V belonged to him or not. Timber was cut indj-SCT5-minal391F from a neighbor's land, railroad land, or the public
domain» It has been reported that Puget Sound was the center of wholesale timber Stealing. In 1861 measures were taken to suppress this

illegal Biztivity and the areas leading lumbermen from Port Gamble,

POI‘t Madison, and Seabeck (all lumbering centers on the shores of the

southern part of Puget Sound) were indicted. The usual penaliar upon a

finding of guilty was payment for the land upon which the timber was cut
plus a jail sentence of "an hour of jolly communion“ with the court, the

prosecution and the defense.

In an effort to prevent spoliation of public timber a charge of

$2.50 a thousand was made for timber cut on government land. This
"stumpage fee” was opposed by mill men of Puget Sound, who felt the
price was e:d'1orbi.ta.nt since the land, if surveyed, could be offered

for sale at $1.25 per acre. An agent sent west during the Grant administration. found that since 1855 on Puget Sound alone timber to the
value of not less than $10,000,000 had been stolen from the govermneuritg. '
During this period a common term in the Pacific Northwest was “round
forty.” A settler would acquire ho to 160 acres of land; then he would
out not only the timber on his own land but on the surrounding land on
all four sides. Before he was through cutting, he would have cut from

160 to 6&0 acres of timber from this government land in addition to his
own 1:0 to 160 acres.

Agriculture

-O

The Nooksack tract contained some fertile river bottom land
which could have been used to produce crops. However, much of this land
‘735 s5ub3§%ct to flooding and could only be utilized where a systm of
drainage ditches had been dug. Other areas of this tract which contained EOOC1 agricultural soil were heavily timbered and the cost of
clearing such land, estimated at from $50.00 to $300.00 per acre, was

Prohibitive. However, most of the soil in the tract was unprodlctive

In

for any agricultural use. Approximately 1:5??? of the total acreage would

be classified as rough and mountainous.

The l86O census report listed 366,156 acres in the Washington
Territory as farmland. This compared with 2,060, 539 acres of farmland
in the Oregon Territory. In 1860 there were only 12 farms containing
2 ,O2§ acres in all of Ehatcom County, exclusive of the San Juan Islands
(Whatcom County at that time also included the present Skagit County).
Less than 0.2% of the total area of Whatcom County was listed as farmland in the 1860 census. Of this amount, only 95 acres were listed as

improved. The early history of the entire Washington Territory and in

particular the Puget Sound area indicates that the use of land for

agricultural purposes was almost exclusively for the subsistence of

the settlers.

31. Under the Oregon Donation Act of September 27, l8S0 '(9 Stat.

I496) settlers were able to acquire a right to land in the Oregon Territory, which included the present State of Washington. The Act originally
provided for grants of 320 acres to single, and 6140 acres to married,
white settlers who had settled on the land claimed prior to December l,
1350. The Act required that the settlers live on the land for four
years, cultivate and improve it for their own use and not as agent for

31130119 91533 that no town lots, mineral lands or lands reserved for

Public Purposes could be selected. -The act limited the donations to

01‘-9 Pei‘ person. Actual proof of a settler‘s compliance with all the

terms of the act was required before a patent could issue, and no patent

could issue until the land was surveyed by the government surveyor.

6 588

I;

In 1851, 58 entries were made in the Washington Territory under the
Donation Act, and in 1852 there were 11? entries.  Preemption Act
of September 1:, 181:1, was made applicable to Washington in 1851;. Under
the Preemption Act , any person who did not own land in the Territory or
who ms not the proprietor of 320 acres of land in any other State or
Territory, might secure 160 acres of public land at $1.25 pr acre provided the land was surveyed, the Indian title extinguished, actual
settlexrsnt made with a dwelling erected, and the settler living on the
land. In 1859 the total acreage taken in the Washington Territory under
the Donation and Preemption Acts totaled 11,277 and this increased in
1360-"50 17,9711 acres. The total number of donation certificates and

acres of land granted in Washington and Oregon was:

Oregon -- 7,317 certificates; 2,563,757.02 acres
Washington -985 certificates; 290,215.33 acres

The Homestead Act was enacted May 20, 1862 (12 Stat. 392) permitting settlers to acqure farms of l60 acres (or 80 acres on land
33111118 for $2.50 per acre) free except for a nominal filing fee. The
Act required cultivation, improvements and five years’ actual occupancy.
However, my person claiming under the Act could secure title before the
expiration of the five years by the payment of‘ the minimum price of the
3-and 393-9°"53d ($1.25 or $2.50 per acre).

Public land could also be acquired by the location of military
land bounty warrants, under the Act of February 11, 181;? (9 Stat. 125),

and °f agricultural college scrips, under the Act of July 2, 1862 (12
Stat. 503).

The Timber and Stone Act of 1878 (20 Stat. 89) permitted the sac

of timber lands in quantities not exceeding 160 acres per person and
at a minimum price of $2.50 per acre.

Title to public land could, of course, only be perfected after the
land was surveyed. The public surveys of the Nooksack land were made
in the l870’s, 1880's and l890‘s; although this did not preclude settlers
from securing private surveys. While it appears that private surveyors
were available in Olympia at the southern point of Puget Sound as early

as 1853, there is no evidence of any private surveys being made in the

immediate area of the Eiooksack tract prior to the evaluation date.

Taking an area which includes all of the Nooksact tract and approximately ILhh,OOO additional acres around it ; the rate at which the land

passed from federal cm:-rmrship was as follows:

10 year Eerioa Acreage Percent of total
1850-1859 0 -0
1860-1869 0 0
1870-1879 12,006 5.3
1880-1889 108,816 148.5

1900- 32,51? 1h.5
School land 9,956 11.11

22h,63l 1 .0

During this period over 5053 of the land was hon:-esteaded and less than
15% was purchased under the Timber and Store Act.
The rate at which the Nooksack land itself passed into private

ownership lagged slightly behind the slmrounding area as shown by the

following table :

32. There is no evidence of any sales of land comparable in size,

character or location to the Nooksack tract prior to 1859. There were,
however, several sales which were similar in certain respects to the

land involved in this case.

The Pope and Talbot firm, the Puget Mill Company, was one of the
earlytpurchasers of tracts of timber land. This company was one of the
largest saavmill companies with a m1'_'L'L at Port Gamble on the western
side of the Sound. Under the Act creating the wesiungton Territory,
two townships of land were allowed for financing the University. The
land could be sold for not less than $1.50 per acre. Pope and Talbot
were permitted to select the best of this University land and the records
5h°W P‘-T!‘ChaS8S of 787.75 acres in 1801; S6S.S(l acres in 1862; and 17,1150
acres in 1863, all at a purchase price of $l.S0‘per acre. The land so
Purchased was choice, accessible timberland, not more than a mile to a
mile and a half from the shoreline of the Sound and within the immediate
Vicinity of the Port Gamble mill. Pope and Talbot also utilized military Scrip ‘to acquire 17,398 acres in 1863 but the exact price paid
cannot be determined,

The Puget Hill Company p11I‘Ch&58d 2, 8119.75 acres

in Island County f or about $1.05 per acre in 1866.

6 59'

The first sale ‘E7 the Northern Pacific Railroad Company was in
December, 1872, when it sold 211.69 acres north of Kalama on the Columbia

River at a price of $5.00 per acre. The first sale of more than 200
acres was in May of 1871;. That involved a tract of 590.36 acres on the
Nisqually Plains which sold for $3.15 per acre. From July 1, 1883, until
June 30, 1881;, the railroad sold a total of 2U.17,1'.50.h9 acres in Washington
for $h.70 per acre. I

The first large purchase of Washington timber land was made on
January 31, 1900, when the famous Weyerhaeuser Timber Companv purchased
900,000 acres of the finest Washington timber land from the Northern
Pacific for a price of $6.00 per acre. However, none of the timber land
was located in the Kcoksack tract or Whatcom County.

The only evidence of land sales referred to by the claimant's expert appraiser in his report was areference to “a number of sales of
partially cleared claims in Whatcom County in the fifties at prices
averaging about $3.00 to $3.25 per acre."

33. The claimazrt called one witness, James A. Crutchfield, to
testify as an expert appraiser. The only exhibit mt:-oduced by the
c1aiina:rt“ in the he-aing on valuation was Mr. Crutchfield‘s l9 page
appraisal report.

Mr. Crutchfield. is an economist holding Bachelor's, Master's and
Doctor's degrees in economics. He is employed as a Professor of
Economics at the University of Washington. He testified that he had
worked for l8 months on a regular basis and at intervals with Larry

Smith 8.: Co., real estate consultants. He was also employed from 191:3

to 19115 as a district economist for the Office of Price Administration

and was employed from 1951 to 1952 as regional economist for the Office

of Price Stabilization. Mr. Crutchfield testified that  wwk for

Larry Smith & Co. involved some valuation of specific properties and

valuation of alternative uses of property to see in which the income

would be higher. On cross examination Mr. Crutchfield testified that

Larry Smith & 00. had never appraised tracts of land in the thousands
of acres and he stated that he did not hold himself out as an expert

appraiser of lands on a contract basis.
Mr. Crutchfield evauated the Nooksack land by two alternative
methods.

(a) The first method used to determine value was on the basis of

the actual commercial use which land might have. Mr. Crutchfield determined that the primary commercial use for the Nooksack area would be
from the prospective yield of the merchantable timber. He then "assumed"

that the timber in the Nooksack area would have averaged 111,000 feet BM

per acre in 1859. He then took a valuation figure of $lLx.OO per acre
as 0f _1900 and discounting that figure at 855 computed a value of $2.01.;
per acre as of 1859. Mr. Crutchfield further found that at least 10%

of the Nooksack land would  usable for agriculture and these were
valued at an average price of $2.50 per acre net of the value of timber,

or an additional 25 cents per acre’ for the entire tract. This results

in 331 average Of $2.29 per acre valuation. No value was assigned for

mineral resources .

(b) The second method of evaluation used by Mr. Crutchfield was

the "subsistence valuation.“ Hr. Crutchfield, in his ‘report, states

that Indians in Washington were employed at money wages of $0.50 to

 8. days 1'1?‘

-50

Taking an average rate of $1.00 a day, Crutchfield
considered that an Indian in 1859 could have earned from $150 to $300
per year. Taking the lower ($150) figure and multiplying it times

[150 (the reported total population of the Nooksack tribe in 1859),

Mr. Crutchfield arrived at a figure which he claims the Nooksaclc Indians
could have made had they worked for the white man rather than in making
their own subsistence from the land. Since it appears the Nooksack
Indians preferred their own way of life to employment at this annual
income, Mr. Crutchfield submits that the land must have been worth at
least that annual income figure. At a capitalization rate of 6% he
computed the value of the Nooksack land to be $1,125,000 from which sum
he deducted 10% or $112,500, representing the ‘value of the fishing rights
retained by the Indians. This leaves the sum of $1,012,500, or about
$12.58 per acre, which he considers was the value of the Nooksack lands
as Of 1859 under Indian usage.

Mr. Crutchfield then multiplied the figures arrived at by both
valuation methods by 2i.7,-‘?I3l‘lch is, he maintains, the value by which
the dollar has depreciatedlsince 1859 on the basis of the index of
wholesale prices of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

311. The defendant submitted voluminous documentary evidence

bearing of the valuation of the Nooksack. land, including an exhaustive

appraisal I‘€‘POI“«> by Mr. Vern A. Englehorn, who also testified for the

defendant as an expert appraiser. Mr. Englehorn is a partner in the
ownership of Western Farm Management Company, which he reports is the
largest farm and ranch management and appraisal service in the western
half of the United States. He has had extensive and varied experience
in land appraisal. Hr. Englehorn appraised the land on the basis of
its fair market value in 1859 taking into consideration that its highest
and best use was timber production and considering its size, accessibility, surrounding sales, and other factors which would be involved in
its utilization or resale. Hr. Englehorn, based on all the facts out‘lined in his report, was of the opinion that the Nooksack area had only
a nominal fair market value not exceeding $5,000, or a little over 6
cents an acre, as of March 8, 1859.

35. Upon the basis of the record and the facts as found above,
the Commission finds that the Nooksack tract, consisting of 80,590
acres, had a fair market value as of March 8, 1859, of $0.65 per acre
or $52,383.50.
