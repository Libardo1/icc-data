stipulation of the parties upon a compromise settlement. Funds to
satisfy the judgment were made available pursuant to Public Law 95-260,
approved March 7, 1978.

3. Attorneys’ Contracts. Contract No. I-l-ind. 42239 dated October 15,
1949, was entered into between the Seminole Indians of the State of Florida
and attorneys John 0. Jackson and Roger J. Waybright. That contract,
approved January 6, 1950, for a term of 5 years, was extended a number
of times. A supplement to this contract, approved by the Department of
the Interior on October 8, 1959, made Effie Knowles, Roy L. Struble, and
Charles Bragman parties to the contract with Roy L. Struble designated
chief attorney having sole responsibility and complete control of the
claims involved in Dockets 73 and 73-A. Contract No. I-l-ind. 42239
expired on January 5, 1965.

On April 30, 1965, the plaintiff tribe executed a new and separate
contract (Symbol 14-20-0650 No. 1292) with attorneys Roy L. Struble,

Effie Knowles, and Charles Bragman which was approved on June 3, 1965.
This contract was amended on June 29, 1965, to cover services rendered
by the attorneys from January 5, 1965 to June 3, 1965. This contract

ran for a term of 10 years from January 5, 1965.

142 Ind. Cl. Conn. 155 157

On November 22, 1974, the Seminole Tribe of Florida entered into a
new contract (K5lC1420092l) with attorneys Roy L. Struble, Effie Knowles,
and Charles Bragman for the prosecution of claims before this Comission
in Dockets 73, 73-A, and 73-B. That contract is for a term of 10 years
from the date of its approval on April 16, 1975. (§gg_39 Ind. Cl. Com.
167, 172 (1976)).

The contracts, as amended, extended, and renewed, provide for a
contingent attorney fee not to exceed 10 percent of the amount of recovery.

4. Notice to Parties. The Clerk of the Commission sent notice of
the filing of the fee application to the plaintiff tribe, the Department
of Justice, the Department of the Interior, and to attorney Effie Knowles,
one of the contract attorneys herein. On March 15, 1978, Mr. Howard E.
Tommie, Chairman of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, informed the Commission
that the Seminole Tribe had no objection to the fee application herein.

On May 11, 1978, attorney Effie Knowles filed a reply directed to the

petition for reimbursable litigation expenses, a matter not under

consideration in this application.

On May 17, 1978, the Department of Justice, taking no position with
respect to allowance of attorneys‘ fees in this case forwarded to the
Commission a letter dated April 28, 1978, from the Associate Solicitor,

Division of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, and a memorandum

dated April 19, 1978, from the Deputy Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Indian

42 Ind. c1. Comm. 15.3 153

Affairs, Department of the Interior. The report of the Deputy Assistant

Secretary, in which the Solicitor concurred, concluded as follows:

While the total fee allowable in the case as
compensation earned by the attorneys is not to
exceed $5,000.00, this Bureau did not participate
in the litigation; thus, we do not have sufficient
detailed information upon which to make a recommendation as to the amount of compensation earned
by the claims attorneys.

5. Attorneys’ Services. The attorneys for the plaintiff in this
docket undertook serious responsibilities and engaged in complex
litigation pursuant to agreement wherein the payment of compensation was
contingent upon recovery. Considering the responsibilities assumed, the
difficult problems of fact and law herein presented, the time and work
involved in successfully litigating the issue of liability, the award
obtained, the contingent nature of the compensation, and all appropriate
factors pertinent to the determination of attorney fees under Section 15
of the Indian Claims Commission Act, 60 Stat. 1049, and standards
established pursuant thereto, the Comission finds that the claims

attorneys have rendered valuable legal services in prosecuting their

client's claim.
6. Conclusion. On the basis of the entire record in this docket,
Section 15 of the Act, the above stated standards, and the contract

currently in force between the attorneys and the plaintiff tribe, the

Commission concludes that the attorneys herein have earned a gross fee

of $5,000.00 representing 10 percent of the award to the plaintiff.

&2 Ind. C1.Conm. 155 159

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that there shall be awarded to Charles Bragman

and Roy L. Struble the amount of $5,000.00 for distribution by them to all

participating attorneys and other persons entitled to share in the fee.

This sum shall represent payment in full of all claims for legal services

in this docket.
