3 - Tflejrarious bands of / ‘I!'%_>1_:awatond.' Nation, which under a
treaty concluded in June, 1811-6, had been removed from their homes
east of the Mississippi to two reserves in Iowa and on the Osage
River in Kansas, were again removed to a tract on the Kansas River
in Kansas. (Dkt. Lu, 3 Ind. Cls. Comm. 13.17)

0/. On November 15, 1861, a treaty (12 Stat. 3.191) proposed by
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs was concluded with the Potawatomi
Nation in order to distribute part of its lands among those who
desired individual allotments and the assignment of part to those
who preferred to_ hold their lands  common.‘ Thus, the Citizen Band,

numbering 114-O0 members, and the Prairie Band, numbering 780 members,

were formed from the Potawatomie Nation in Kansas under the 1861

treaty.

6 6-’4~{ *1

By Article III of said Treaty of l86l it was provided and
agreed that, upon proper proof to the satisfaction of the United
States District Court of Kansas of their ability to control their
affairs and interests, and that they have adopted the hébits Of
civilized living and have been able to support for at least five
years themselves and their families, adult male Potawatomies would
cease to be members of the tribe and could then become Citizens Of
the United States.

This treaty further granted an option to the Leavenworth. Pawnee
and'Western Railroad Company to purchase the remainder of the lands
within siximonths after the above—mentioned Indian selections had
been made.

The funds from.the sales of their lands were to be held

in trust b1 the United States for the Pottawatomies.

Ratification of the treaty was protested.in a petition presented
by the Prairie Band. However, the treaty was ratified'by the United
States Senate on April 15, 1862 and proclaimed on.April 19. 1852(Fdg. 13, Dkt. 11.1, 3 Ind. Cls. Comm. 23)

5. By'l862 many'emigrants passed through the Potawatomie lands
in Eastern Kansas on their'way'further‘west. Theft and trespass upon
Indian property grew to be a rather common occurrence. The Commissioner
of Indian Affairs, in.his annual report to Congress in 1852, and for
several years subsequent thereto, repeatedlY'UfSed that treaties be
negotiated with the tribes in eastern Kansas, including the Potawatomi,

whereby new reservations would be established in the Indian countI'5" to

the south of Kansas for such of the Indians as would be willing to

'.'z'1OV€' .

6. On February 27, l867, the Citizen Band of Potawatomie
Indians entered into a treaty with the United States (15 Stat. 531_)«»
This "Treaty of 1867," as amended, was ratified by the United States
Senate on July 25, 1868 (15 Stat. 535).

This . “Treaty of 1867" recited in its preamble, as amended, as
follows:

Whereas the Potawatomies believe that it is for the interest of their tribe that a home should be secured for .
them in the Indian country south of Kansas, while there 15‘
yet an opportunity for the selection of a suitable reservation; and whereas the tribe has the means of purchasing

such reservation from funds to arisefrom the sale of lands
under the provisions of this treaty, without interfering
with the exclusive. rights of those of their people who hold
their lands in common to the ownership of their diminished
reserve, held by them in common, or with their right to

receive their just proportion of the moneys arising from the
sale of unallotted lands, knot-In as surplus lands: (15 Stat533-. 534. 535)

Article I of the Treaty of 1867 provided a Potawatomie delegation
to accompany a government conmission "in order to select, if possible,
a suitable location for their people without interfering with the
locations made for other Indians“ and to be approved by the Secretary
of the Interior; that “ 
eaaa-2. shall be set apart as a  —
D8-1'1C“,f of that tribe * * *, " same to be patented to the Potawatomie
Nation. (Underscoring supplied).

Article 11, as amended, provided the price to be paid by the
tribe for said reservation "shall not exceed the cost of same to the
Government of the United States"; and providing such sum to be taken

from tribal funds received from the sales of their Kansas lands, and

 :2

since the Leavenworth, Pawnee and Western Railroad Company had failed
to exercise the option to purchase such lands as provided in the Treaty
of l86l, that the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Company be
granted an option to purchase such lands.

Article III provided that after such Oklahoma reservation shall
have been set apart for the Potawatomies, it shall never be included
within the jurisdiction of any state, or territory, unless an Indian
territory be organized and that Potat-ratomies resident thereon be given
equal representation with other tribes.

Article IV provided for a register to be prepared both of those
Potawatomies electing to stay in Kansas and of those desiring to
remove to Oklahoma and for the right of alienation of the Kansas lands
of those removing to the reservation in Oklahoma.

Article V contained the terms and conditions of the use of the
funds held in trust by the United States "for the benefit of such
owner" in his removal and that of his family to the new reservation.

Article VI provided that the trust funds and other provisions of
“Article third of the treaty of April nineteenth, eighteen hundred

and sixty two, relative to citizens who desire to be come citizens.

shall continue in force * * f“ (underscoring supplied).
7. In February, l870, a Citizen Band delegation selected a

tract in the Indian country pursuant to the l867 treaty’.
21-21+).

(Pet. Ex.
Secretary of the Interior Delano gave his approval of their
selection on November 9, 1870, in his letter to Commissioner of Indian
Affairs E. S. Parker, wherein Secretary Delano unequivocally recogized their ownership, including therein this statement:

6 650»?

The site selected by these Indians is reported as including the land between’ the Canadian River and the North

Fork of said river" and bounded on the I_i2.as_t by, thewest ].:'me

of the Seminole lands & e:c'té'nding;"we§t,l "from said boundary

line to embrace nine hundred square miles, to which they are

entitled. (Pet. Ex, 30, Comp., p." 59)

This tract comprised appro$_mately 575,877 acres, of which about
two-fifths had been acquired by the Government from the Greeks and
about three-fifths from the Seminoles at. a total cost to the Government
of approximately $119,79o_,oo, (Bet, Ex.__51+,‘Comp., p. ll’-I»; Def. Ex. 9)

8. The so-called Absentee Shawnees had separated from ‘the body
of the Shawnee Nation during the early 18140 ‘s and had settled at that
time within the tract selected in 1870 by the Potawatomies. (I_’et. Eic.
33, 51, 5L», and 57) . They remained loyal to the Union during the Civil
War and suffered severe losses of livestock and crops because of their
loyalty and were driven from Oklahoma. However , by 1870 , they numbered
575, nearly all of whom possessed horses, cattle and hogs and raised
corn and had moved back to their homes on the tract which was a portion

of the tract selected as a reservation for the Citizen Band of the
Potawatomi. (Pet. Ex. 25)

In February 1872 the Absentee Shawnee addressed a petition to the
President of the United States setting forth these aforementioned
facts and that they had never received any payment for Shawnee lands
in Kansas and praying that the President give them title to a portion
of the land on the Potawatomie reservation north of Little River upon

which lands they had made their homes and had constructed valuable

inaprovements over a period of many years.

6 651

Indian.Agent Hadley endorsed the petition with the recommendation

that it be granted "as reasonable, just and right.” Superintendent

Hoag transmitted the petition to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs

6 652

also with a request of favorable action. He reported that the Potawatomi

had expressed a willingness not to disturb the Absentee Shawnee, but had
asked that their reservation be extended westward so as to include an

additional eguivalent area. (Pet. Ex. 43, Comp. pp. 78-80) (Underscoring supplied)

By letter dated April 15, 1872, the Commissioner of Indian.Affairs
recommended to the Secretary of the Interior that legislation be enacted
t0 Provide for an allotment to each Indian of pure or mixed blood of
Absentee Shawnees, being a head of a family. or*a male over 21 years of
age. of 80 acres of land, to include so far as possible his improvements.

together with an addition of 20 acres for each.male child under 2l years"

of age.__(Def. E3» 3)_ ?his_led to the passage of the act of gay 23, 1872
(17 Stat. 159. Pet. Ex. 49).

This Act of 1872 authorized.the Secretary to make allotments of
lan within.the reservation of the Oklahoma tract of land to each member
of the Citizen Band an provided also for allotments to Absentee Shawnee
Indians, within the Potawatomi Reservation, who had resided thereon for
three continuous'years, without payment of any consideration. The
statute also contained this proviso:

Provided, Said.Pottawatomie Indians shall neither acquire

nor exercise under the laws of the United States any rights
or privileges in said Indian territory. other than those

9113035-‘d by the members of the Indian tribes lawfully residing therein. And for the protection of the rights of

persons and property among themselves , they may enforce

the laws and usages heretofore enforced mong them as an

Indian tribe, not inconsistent with the Constitution and

laws of the United States, and shall be entitled to equitable

representation in the general territorial council and subject to -the general laws which it may legally enact.

On, December 31, l8-81+, Commissioner Price reported to the Secretary
of the Interior that only ll members of the Citizens Band and no Absentee
Shawnees had been issued certificates of allotment, a majority of the

latter refusing to take lands in severalty.

9. Both the members of the Citizen Band and the Absentee Shawnee

continued thereafter to reside on the Oklahoma tract. However, the

Citizen Band maintained the position that under the l867 treaty the
land belonged to the Band and that the Absentee Shawnee were merely

residing thereon by their permission and were subject to being evicted
by them. (Pet. Ex. 1+3, 55 and 56, comp. pp. 80, 1.17.119)
10. On February 8, 188?, Congress adopted a General Allotment

Act (24 Stat. 388) which authorized the allotment in severalty of lands
Of 3113’ tribe or band located on a reservation and also provided nonreservation Indians could obtain individual holdings on public lands .

Section 6 of the Act provided for citizenship of Indians who had

adopted habits of civi'Lized lii‘ e without impairment of their individual
or tribal property rights.

\

UPOII passage of this Act the Secretary of the Interior held that
provisions of the General Allotment Act applied to both the Citizen
Band and to the Absentee Shawnee, and allotments on the Potawatomi

Reservation in Oklahoma were made to members of both groups thereunder.

f

ll. In l889 the Secretary of the Board of Indian Commissioners
reported his conclusions that neither the Absentee Shawnees or the
Potawatomies had obtained any legal title to any lands in the 
'teI'T5-J‘-0T3? because the Absentee Shawnees settled upon such lands without authority of the Government; and the Potawatomie , had never paid
for such lands, and were therefore never issued a patent to same.
(Pet. Ex. 55, Comp. pp. 118-119)

However, the previous year, on February 7 , 1888 , the House Com...
mittee on Territories had published Report No. 263, 50th Congress,
Stating that 550 members of the Potawatomie Tribe occupied a reservati0n 05 575,877 acres with a map of tribal lands attached which

omitted any mention of any ownership by or reference to the Absentee

Shawnee. (Pet. Ex. 66)
12. The Government concluded an agreement with the Citizen Band
June 25. 1890. which provided in substance as follows:

CL) The Band relinquished to the United States 2.11 its "elm,
title and interest” in the Oklahoma tract as described by metes and
bounds, “containing an area of five hundred and seventy-five thousand
eight hundred and seventy and f orty-.two one hundredths acres of land"
(Art. I) .

(2) Allotments made and being made under the General Allotment
Act were confirmed. If more than .l?+OO Indians should have allotments
so confirmed, than $1 per acre of such excess allotments should. be
deducted from the consideration to be paid the ‘Band for its cession.

(3) The United States agreed to pay the Citizen Band the sum

of $l50.ooo and also agreed to pay the Citizen am an additional

6 651+

6 655

$3-l9.790.75 should it be ascertained the United States had retained
said amount from the Indians‘ fund as reimbursement for the original.
cost to the Government of the Oklahoma Reservation under the terms
of the 1867 treaty. (26 Stat. 989, 1.016; Pet. Ex. 61.»)

13 . On the following day , a similar agreement was concluded with
the Absentee Shawnee wherein the Government took a cession of the
identical tract asdescribed in the cession from the Citimen Band for
the sum of $65,000 less $1.00 per acre for individual allotments in
excess of 650. The Absentee Shawnee allotments amounted to a total
of 54,677.57 acres. (26,Stat. 989, l0l9)

914. A total of 213,0)-#+.78 acres were allotted to 1,118? members
of the Citizen Band. (Def. E3}. 9; Def. Proposed Fdg. ll; Pet. Proposed
mg. 29). '

15. The United States, in the 1867 treaty, promised thelcitizen
Band o'i_‘ Potawatomi Indians "a home in the Indian country" not exceeding
thirty miles square (900 square miles). This treaty was signed on
February 27, 1867, ratified by the United States Senate on Juli-’25, 1868
and proclaimed by the President on August 7, 1868 (H Kappler 970; 15:

Stain 531. 534. 535).
The express conditions set forth in this treaty were:

(1) A Government commission, accompanied by a delegation
of the Potawatomi would select the reservation lands with the approval

of the Potawatomi delegation.

(2) The location would be subject to the approval of the

899797331‘? Of the Interior.

(3) A survey of the reservation lines and boundaries would be

made. Payment for the reserved lands upon a cost basis to the Government would be taken from funds of the Potawatomi. Those funds were held

in trust by the United States from sales of Kansas lands which had been

ceded by the Potawatomi in the 1861 treaty.

(4) The Government promised such lands would be "set apart
for the exclusive use and occupancy of that tribe " and the United
States would issue a patent to same to the Potawatomi Nation, and thereby it became obligated to convey same to petitioners. The patent was

never issued. (Pet. Ex. 1&6, Comp. pp. 89 and 90)
It is not disputed that the Citizen Band relied upon the Government‘ 5 promise of a home and removed from Kansas to the Potawatomi

Reservation in Oklahoma. The Citizen Band occupied a portion of same

as their home 1‘ rom l872 to 1892. After individual allotments were made ,
the unallotted lands were ceded back to the Government by formal agreement in 1890. (626 Stat. 989)

16. The Oklahoma tract of land known as “the Potawatomi Indian
Reservation“ contained a total of 575,877 acres. This reservation
was approved by the Secretary of the Interior in his letter to Commissioner Parker dated November 9, 1870.

(Finding 8 above)

Petitioner was entitled to compensation for the surplus
lands: that is, 575,877 acres less allotments of 213,0?-14.78 acres,
leaving as surplus 362,83;.22 acres. Petitioners received $160,000

for said surplus lands. Future hearings will be had as to their value

6 656

as 05 June 25. 1890. As to whether or not this was iihconscionable

will be determined after determination of the value on June 25, 1890.
‘t_“urther evidence will also be received as to whether the plaintiff

Indians are indebted to the defendant in the original obligation of
$119,790.75.
