the tribal records pertaining to the Choctaw Court of Claims,
the Choctaw net proceeds commission and other tribal papers
concerning the disposition of the money appropriated by

Congress to satisfy the judgent of the Unitedhgtates Court
in the net proceeds case on file in this office, it does
not appear that any absent Mississippi Choctaw Indians

this fund.“ -_- - _ 16. In a letter of the First Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of

case of the Choctaw Nation vs. the United States.“ (Referring
to thepclaim-decided by 21 Ct. C15. 59 and 119 U. s. 1).

The letter further continues:

‘An appropriation in favor of the Choctaw Nation was
made by Section 9 of the act of Congress of June 29, l888
(25 Stat. L 217-239) in settlement of the clams of the
Choctaw Nation and people against the United States, (that is,

U. S. 1) and was disbursed in accordance_-with various acts
of the Choctaw Council, the distribution to the individual

claimants being a tribal matter, the Choctaw Ration having

assumed the liabilitr to the individual claimants.‘
