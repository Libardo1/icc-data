years after July 1%, 181%’. comprised a number of tribes. nations. bands,
and rancherias or villages. Each group occupied a definite part of the

area of the state. _

treaty of July 1&,;l81l8, tens of thousand of whi to people entered the
State, and asha result of this great influx of white people, the Indian
Communities wereldisrtzputod. many of their members killed, and those ronaining. scattered throughout the State. Asa result of this treatment

Jarnzary, 1352, eighteen treaties were conmsraatecl between 139 tribes,

nations, and bands of California Indians, accozeiing to the number o£

gasps iniicated in the treaties. It is pro'oahie, however, that in
spite oi the 139 eigeatories to these treaties they were not made with
more than a'eo*.1t 56 actaal tribes, nations, or hands,
