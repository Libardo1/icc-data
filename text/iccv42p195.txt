4. Response of Parties. No response was received from the tribal
representatives. The Department of Justice takes no position with respect
to the allowance of attorney expenses in these dockets, as stated in its
letter of June 28, 1978. Incorporated in the letter of the Department
of Justice was a letter dated June 14, 1978, from the Associate Solicitor,
Division of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, and a memorandum
dated June 6, 1978, from the Assistant Secretary, Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior. The memorandum and letter from the Department of
the Interior indicate no objection to the allowance of items claimed as
expenses in the petition for reimbursement. The memorandum states that
the items claimed appear to be reasonable and fall generally into those
categories of expenses proper for reimbursement.

5. The Application. The petitioner requests that the Commission

enter an order for payment to him of the sum of $9,330.72 as reimbursement
for litigation expenses, itemized in several categories in the petition

and supported by vouchers.

6. Petition Adjustments. Upon examination of the petition and the
documents filed in support thereof, the Comission determines that three
adjustments of claimed expenses are in order:

1) Louis L. Rochmes, Law Offices, Voucher No. 34, $42.23
for long distance telephone calls~-on the itemized list of
expenses are shown telephone calls totaling $43.23, but through
apparent clerical error only $42.23 was claimed on the voucher,
leaving a one dollar discrepancy in favor of petitioner. The

Commission has included $43.23 as the correct figure in its
total of awarded expenses.

42 Ind. C1. Com. 195 198

ii) Expenses of trip to Washington, Voucher No. 54, $127.52

representing a 3/8 share of $340.14 in expenses prorated among
four tribes--this share should have been computed as $127.55,
creating a three cent discrepancy in favor of petitioner. The
Commission has included $127.55 as the correct figure in its
total of awarded expenses.

iii) Under the SUMMARY OF REIMBURSABLE EXPENSES, the petition
omitted a figure for court reporting, although vouchers for same
were submitted with the petition and were reflected in the
itemized list of expenses accompanying the petition. Court
reporting in Vouchers 20 and 45 totals $751.44, and the Commission

has included this figure in its total of awarded expenses.

The claimed expenses, as adjusted, are as follows:

(a) Expert assistance, research $4,996.76
and related expenses
(b) Travel expenses 1,057.58
(c) Printing of briefs and petitions 1,773.28
(d) Reproduction of exhibits 302.90
(e) Long distance telephone 447.04
(f) Court reporting 751.44
(g) Postage, filing fees and 2.75
miscellaneous
Total expenses $9,331.75.

7. Determination of Reimbursable Expenses. Pursuant to Section 15
of the Indian Claims Commission Act, 25 U.S.C. 5 70(n), and Rule 34(b)

of the Comission's Rules of Procedure, 25 C.F.R. § 503.34(b), as amended,
39 Fed. Reg. 41173 (1974), the Commission's Policy Statement § 102 issued
July 15, 1968, the findings of fact entered herein, the employment contracts
between the parties, and the entire record of expenses incurred in the

prosecution of the claims presented in these dockets, the Comission

42 Ind. Cl. Comm. 195 199

concludes that items claimed in the petition as adjusted are reasonable
and proper for reimbursement in the amount of $9,331.75.

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that out of funds appropriated to pay the
award in Dockets 27-B and 338 there shall be disbursed to Jack Joseph,
attorney of record, the sum of $9,331.75 as reimbursement in full for
expenses incurred in the prosecution of the claims of the Delaware Tribe
of Indians, plaintiffs in Docket 27-3, and the Absentee Delaware Tribe

of Oklahoma, plaintiffs in Docket 338, said sum to be disbursed in turn

by Jack Joseph to all parties having an interest in this application.
