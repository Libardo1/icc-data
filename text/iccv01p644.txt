ADDITIOKAL FINDINGS 9E_EACT

The Commission makes the following additional findings of fact:t
Article 1; of the Treaty of November 15, 1821+, 7 Stat. 232, provides:

The Quapaw Tribe of Indians will hereafter be concentrated and confined to the district of country inhabited by

the Caddo Indians, and form a part of said Tribe. Ehe said

nation of Indians are to commence removing to the district

allotted then, before the twentieth day of January, one

thousand eight hundred and twenty-six.

10. Pursuant to the provisions of said Article, the Quapaw Indians were removed from their ceded lands in Arkansas to the country inhabited by the Caddo Indians and were located therein on the Bayou
Treache on.the Red River. The boundaries of the land occupied by the
Quapaw in the Caddo country are not shown in the evidence.

11. The United States was not required by the treaty of 182M to
provide the plaintiffs with any land in the Caddo Indian country, and

did not do so, for the land they were removed to and occupied therein

was given them by the Caddo Indians.

12. ‘The country occupied by plaintiffs proved unhealthy, was
subject to frequent inundations which annually destroyed their crops,
and the Caddo refused to incorporate them into their tribe as was
contemplated by the 18214 treaty. As the result of the unhealthy climate
and physical conditions on the Red River, and the antagonism of the
Caddo Indians, most, if not all the Qpapaw, returned to their former
home in.Arkansas and requested the defendant to restore part of the
lands the Indians had coded in 1821+. This the defendant would not do,

but it agreed to provide the Quapaw with a permanent home in.a more

qsuitahle location, and this was done by the treaty of 1833, hereafter

referred to.
.13. Article 2 of the treaty of November 15, l82H, reads as
follows:

In consideration of the cession made in the first
article of this Treaty, by the aforesaid Chiefs and
Warriors, the United States engage to pay to the four
head Chiefs of the Qpapaw Nation, the sum of five hundred
dollars each, in consideration of the losses they will
sustain by removing from their farms and improvements.
The payment to he made at the time they receive their
annuity for the year 1825. .And, also, to the said nation,
the sum of four thousand dollars, to be paid in goods, at
the signing of this Treaty. .And the United States also
engage to pay to the Qnapaw Nation, one thousand dollars
in specie, annually, for the term of eleven years, in
addition to their present annuity.

The defendant paid to or expended for plaintiffs the following pur)suant to the provisions of said article;

Annuities in cash or goods...... ..... .. $ 7,150.00

and as a compensation for the losses sustained, and the

and salt, for six months, from the first day of January,
one thousand eight hundred and twenty-six. The United
States further agree to furnish a sum.not exceeding one
thousand dollars, to be expended by their agent, to facilitate the transportation of the said Tribe to the district
of country herein assigned them. An.agent, Sub Agent, or

and to reside among them.
