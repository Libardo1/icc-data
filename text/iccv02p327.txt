Witt, chief commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Comm.ssion.

claimant denominates itself as The Sa.iattle-Sa:I3.1: Tribe of Indians, sometimes known as The Suiattle Tribe, and it is alleged in the
petition, that said claimant is a tribe, band, or group which has a
tribal organization recognized by the Secreta_r'y of the Interior, and

that said claimant is an identifiable group within the mean& of the

Indian claims Commission Act.
claimant alleges that it occupied an area of land composed of
Townships 3o, 31, 32, 33, and 314 North, in Ranges 9, lo, 11, 12, 13,
and 111-, East of the Willamette Meridian, being lands extending along
the suiattle and Saul: Rivers west of the summit of the Cascade Range
. of mountains in what is now the State of Washington. The total number
of acres is not alleged in the pleadings filed, but in a suit previously filed (but later dismissed). in the Court of Claims (Cause No.
In-33), it is alleged the land owned by it comprised approximatelqr
1,600,000 acres. claimant‘ alleges that said lands were appropriated
by the defendant for its own use vzithout  any payment to claimt
therefor; that this was done without any treaty 1'-rith this tribe of
_ Indians. claimant alleges the value of the lands in 3.855, at the

time they were taken by the defendant, to be the sum of $15,000,000.

It sues for .that sum together with interest.

, {the defendant, by answer, sets up that (1) the petition fails
to state a claimtagainst the defendant upon which relief can be
granted; (2)  the claim sued on is barred by the decision of
the court of claims in the case entitled Duwamish, et al. v. United
States, reported. in 79 0. 01s. 530; (3) that the claimant is not a
Itribe, band, or other identifiable group of Indians" within the
meaning of the Indian claims commission Act.
By order of this commission of date August 211-, 1951, the com—- '
mission directed a hearing upon the defenses of lav: and fact involved

inthe plea that the decision of the court of claims constituted a

bar to the consideration of this case, and upon the defense raising

the issues of fact and law as to the capacity of the claimant to

maintain the action.

A hearing was held and evidence introduced. on September 21%,
1951, on the issues involved in said special defenses and thereafter, by orders of the commission, the defendant was allowed to

file additional evidence consisting of defendant! s Exhibits Nos.

la. to 30, inclusive, and clainant was allowed. to file additional

evidence consisting of claimant's Exhibits Nos. 6 to 23-A, inclusive, and the depositions of sundry witnesses were taken at
Darrington, Washington,‘ on November 20-21, 1951, and filed herein

on Ijecember 27, 195.. Thereafter briefs were filed by both claimant
and defendant as to said issues so submitted.

Presumably the land involved in the instantcase was the same
land made the basis of the suit L—33 filed in the Court of Claims,
though an examination of the pleadings in that case discloses that
the land is not described in the same way it is described in the
instant case.

I

claimant, and the claimant's requested findings of fact, considered

The pleadings, the proof, the argument znde by the

along with the Dmamish case, are confusing. In this connection,
attention is called to the fact that while claimant sues in the name
of The suiattle-Sank or Suiattle Tribe, by its Requested Finding No.
11!» it asks this Commission to find that The Suiattle—Sau.h' Tribe is
the same tribe as the Sliattle Tribe and the same tribe as referred
to in exhibits as the Sak-wi-behu, S8-kumehu, Sah-l~n1-zne-lrm, Sao-mengh, Sock—a-muk, and Sabhiuqu, and "that as such they existed in

2

329

...-su .uu.-:-.J-I-oL-u-.-oo'1855 and for time immemorial before that; that they continued to
exist since; that the said tribe is in existence today; and that
as such it is a tribe, band or other identifiable group of Indians
authorized to and having capacity to nnintain this action.‘

The treaty of Jamiary 22, 1855 (12 Stat. 927), known as the

Point Elliott-Treaty, names the Sah-kn-me-hu as one of the tribes

executing the same, and one Indian claiming to be a sub—chief of
that tribe is shown as a signer to such treaty._ It would seem,
therefore, that if the Suiattle—sa.u.k or suiattle Tribe is the same
as the sah-1:u-me-hu Tribe, then the rights of claimant herein cannot

be determined as a non-treaty tribe as claimed in the petition, but i

 

must be rights, if any, or wrongs, if any, growingout of the said
treaty. It is not in evidence that any treaty was ever made with
any tribe of Indians described as the suiattle—$.ul: Tribe, or the
suiattle Tribe, and this seems to have been recognized by Congress

in the passage of the jurisdictional act under which the Duwamish
suit ‘was filed, because in that act the Suiattle Tribe or Band is
among those withswhom it is stated no, treaty had been mde. If the
Sah-kru-me—m. Tribe is the same tribe as the Suia.ttle—Saulc or Suiattle,

as claimed by the claimant by its Requested. Finding Ho. 13+, then the

reason for not having made a treaty with the Suiattle—Sau.‘: or Suia-'6?-18

Tribe may be because said Indians were not so known at the time of
the Point Elliott Treaty. That this was the situation is indicated
by the fact that the Point Elliott Treaty takes a cession of all

the northwest portion of the present State of Washington (then called

Oregon) that was north of the 147th parallel and west of the cascade

33

—.n-o-—--—-___...—.p.._-—auun--1_-_._po_....o- --~I-I--"-'-""""""'Mountains, including the lands claimed by the claimant herein, and
that said treaty is executed. by practically  the tribes or bands
of Indians whose names appear on the various mps in evidence as oi‘
that period, including the Sah-1:u-me—hu; and that none of these maps
shows the names of Suiattle-Sank or Suiattle as being a tribe occupying any portion of the territory ceded by the Point Elliott Treaty-—
though said maps do show the Sah-kzu-me-hu as occupying the territory
now claimed by the Suiattle-E or the Suiattle.

In this connection notice is taken of the act of Congress of
June 5, 1850 (9 Stat. 3437), wherein the President is authorized to appoint commissioners to negotiate with the several Indian tribes in
the territory of Oregon having claims lying west of the Cascade
Mountains; that said commissioners, in negotiating the Point Elliott
Treaty, did not include any tribe known as the Suiattle—n or
Suiattle, but did include seemingly every known tribe in the territory ceded (including the .Sa.h-ku-me-hu) . Ehis is persuasive that
at that time there was no such tribe existing as the Suiattle-Sauk
or Suiattle Tribe , and that the Indians that thereafter beme known
as the Suiattle-Saul: or siiattle Indians were originally known as the
Sah-Em-me—hJ.1 Indians, or as some other tribe.

The evidence submitted indicates tint among the claimant Indians
are Indians whose ancestors lived on the Saulz, Suiattle and skagit
Rivers and that they represented some autonomous villages on said
rivers, but we think same is insufficient to establish that they

constitute a definite determinable Indian tribe, band, or other identifiable group of Indians, or the successor, or the descendants

The treaty ceding the land involved in the instant case along
with other lands, as herein previously stated, is the treaty of
January 22, l855 (12 stat. 927), called the Point Elliott Treaty,
-d5ij§fff= which was negotiated by Governor Isaac Stevens and associates, all
. of whom were familiar with the territory involved and the various

tribes and bands of Indians living thereon. Maps of Governor Stevens
in evidence dated September 16, 185k, December 30, 1856, and March,
1557, shot: neither a '*3.1ia‘ttle" nor a "Su.iattle-Sank“ thereon, but

River. A war Demrtment mp of the territory involved dated 1858

, 55 does not locate either a Suiattle or.a sniatt1e—sauh Tribe in the
area involved. Dr. George Gibbs, an Indian Ethnologist, in his
publication entitled “Contribution to North American Ethnology,"
Vol. 1, 1877., makes no mention of either a Suiattle or Su.iattle-Sank

 Tribe or Band; in his mp, however, of Indian tribes of the Washington

Territory of 1376, he identifies the sah-hn-ne—hn Tribe as being Skagit.
Rev. mrron Bells, a missionary writing in l87'{, mentions the Sah-1:11-mehu as being Skagit and living on the south bank of the S1-2.g:I.t River.

    He makes no mention of a Siiattle or a Suiattle-—Sank Tribe or ‘Band.

Dr. James I-Iooney's map showing tribes of the upper Columbia region

in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, including the areainvolved. herein,
shows same as S‘.-cagit territory, t no mention is made either on the
map or in -his writings of a Suiattle or St3.iattle—Sa.ulc Tribe orBa.mi.

in 1910 , mentions the Sa.h-lni-ne—hn. as one of the numerous hands around Pugit Sound, but he does not mention a Stiiattle or SuiattleSaik Band or Tribe. In fact, no anthropological or historical

writer undertaking to identify Indians occupying the territory
involved in 1855 or thereabouts speaks of  group known as
Suiattle or aiiattle-i. The evidence indicates that the use

of the name Suiattle and Suiattle—Sau}.-: came about in later years

and was indicative only of the Indians living on or near the Suiattle

and San}: mvers. The earliest reports so describing said Indians

as Suiattle or Suiattle-San.k_were made more than 50 years later

than 1855, and as previously stated,'it is thought the‘Indians

were so described because of their geographical location.

If the Indians are descenmts of the Sa.h-1:11-me-hues, as

claimnt requests us to find, pthenthey are precluded from suing

as a non-treaty tribe becanse they were mrties to the Point Elliott
Treaty; if they are descendants of the Skagits then they are precluded
becaiise the sea;-its were parties to the Pointrglliott Treaty; and for
the further reason that the Skagits were parties to the Duwanish

suit heretofore mentioned, and are plaintiffs in a suit now pending
before this Cozzmission, styled Docket I1'o._92, based on the same land
involved in the pending suit.

Regardless of whether or not the suit should be dismissed ‘oecanse of the fact that claimants were either Sah—1:u_—me—-hues or Ssagits,

it would have to be dismissed because of the failure to establish the

‘ : fact that they are descendants of a tribe, band, or other identifiable
