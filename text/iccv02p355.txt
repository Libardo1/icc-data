OPINION CF TEE COMMISS ICIN

 

-o

IITT, _Chief Commissioner, delivered the opinion of the Commission.

This case involves seven claims presented by the Otoe and Hissouria
Tribe of Indians, which are separately treated and will be separately
considered. - A

FEST CAUSE OF ACTION

This cause of action is based on a claimed undivided interest of
approximately one-seventh in the lands lying east of the Missouri River,
principally in the territory now part of the State of Iowa, ceded by

treaties to which plaintiff was a party,-dated July 15, 1830 (7 Stat.

......:.-u-is-a..—n-_-on-.—-..s..- - .. q. . -.-— _ .. - —

2 356

328), October 15. lS36 (7 Stat. 52k), and March 15, l85h (10 Stat. 1038).
Plaintiff's interest is alleged as being approximately 2,322,285 acres
of the average reasonable znarket value of $1.25 per acre; plaintiff
alleging that the consideration received by it by said cession was a
total of $614,682.78, or 2.8 cents per acre. ‘Ends consideration, it
alleges, was unconscionable, and it sues for the difference between the
alleged value and the amount received. The land involved is tract l5l
on B.oyce‘e Map df Iowa Ho. 1. 3 ; ‘

Plaintiff claims, if not Indian title Jointly with the other plaintiffs, at least a bona fide :"right of occupancy and use f or‘hunting purposes.“ The initial question to be considered ‘is the title, if any, of

the plaintiff to the lands claimed. In this connection, it is to he noted

that there is no substantial proof of the actual occupancy by the plaintiff tribe at any time of any definitely described portion of the land in
which it claims an undivided interest. !Ehe most that can be said of the
proof is that the plaintiff tribe did some hunting on some portions of
the territory. |

Early in the Eighteenth Century the plaintiff tribe was located in
that is now the southern part of Nebraska, between the Platte River on
the north, and the Great Hemaha River on the south. The villages which
were occupied by the tribe at various times were all located on the south
side of the Platte about 30 to 3+0 miles above its confluence with the
Missouri. lhe tribe was usually found in only one village when visited
by explorers and traders, but this village was not at all times in the
881118 Place. being occasionally moved from one location to another in the

same vicinity. The tribe continued to occupy its villages in this area

, . .

and to hunt over the area between the Platte and the Great Nemaha Rivers, west‘ of the Missouri River, and was so occupied in using this

area in Indian fashion at the time of the Louisiana Purchase, and at

the time of the treaty of July 15, 1830.

Uhile the plaintiff tribe also claimed an tmdefined area east of

the Missouri River over which it sometimes roamed and hunted, we find

no actual occupancy or claim of the right _of possession to any defined

area east of the Missouri River. Therefore, this Commission holds that

the plaintiff tribe has not established Indian title to any of the lands

claimed as a basis for its First" Cause of Action. Said tribe at most

only had hunting rights to be exercised Jointly with other tribes over
an undefined area east of the Missouri, and theyalue of these hunting I
rights was growing _less and less as the buffalo and other_game disapPeared, and the Commission, even granting ownership of such rights, is
unable to determine their value, or that the compensation received

therefor was not adeqzate or was unconscionable; or that the plaintiff

has; been unfairly treat ed.

The First Cause of Action must therefore be di smissed.

SECOND CAUE OF ACTION

This Cause of Action is based on Article X of the treaty of July 15,
1330. In this article there is set aside a tract of land west of the
Missouri Ever and bounded on the east by said river, and lying between
the Little and the Great Nemaha Rivers (being Royce's Plat 155 of Heb1'333<'-3). C0111PI'iSi11é.’ 1343.6}-F7.33 acres, to the half-breeds of the plaintiff tribe and of other tribes. The treaty recites that the acreage

so set aside to said half-breeds belonged at the time to the plaintiff

tribe, and the plaintiff tribe "alone of the tribes making the cession
was paid for said lands? the sum of $3.000, or 3.26 cents per acre. Of
the lands so ceded, 93,894.62 acres wereallotted to half-breed members of tribes other than the plaintiff tribe. Plaintiff contends
that it owed no duty to the half-breeds of- the other tribes and that
the defendant, as the guardian of the plaintiff, ovzed the plaintiff

the duty of preventing it from disposing of its lands at such a price,

‘ and that it should have a Jmiaent against the defendant for the difference between the then fair actual value of the said 93,853.62 acres allotted to the half-breeds of tribes other than half-breeds of its on
tribe and the consideration actually received by it for said lands.
Growing out of this same cession, plaintiffalso asserts a cause
of action for the difference in the amount received and the fair market
value, at the time, of 15,697 acres which plaintiff alleges the defendant failed by error in surveying to allot to the half-breeds.
Plaintiff alleges that at_the time of the cession, the value of

ther93,s6h.62 acres was $2.50 per acre, and that of the 15,697 acres

bras $14.82 per acre.

ihe article of the treaty making this cession recites that the
Omahas, Ioways and Ottoefs, for themselves, and in behalf of the Yanckton
and Santie Bands of Sioux, having earnestly requested that they might be
permitted to make some provision for their half-breeds, are conveying

the land involved to said half-breeds. It is aPPa.rent that the de1.3353-D-15 113-i'°h9I’ Suggested that this cession be made for the benefit of
these half-breeds or what the consideration moving to the tribe for such

conveyance should ‘be. There was no profit or benefit of any kind moving

......;-._-—m—. _ _..-_.__ - .

,__......-..._.......‘_.._._.-4..-.to the defendant by reason of such conveyance to these half-breeds.

we find that the Indians were intelligent enough to know what they
were doing and that they were not improperly influenced in any way
in the making of such provision for half-breeds. This Conmission_

does not think the duty of the defendant warranted its interference
in this transaction of these tribes with each other; nor that the

plaintiff can require, Just because the defendant stood by and did

_not interfere with the transaction, that it should be held liable

to the plaintiff when it (the defendant government) was not profiting in any way by the transaction.

With reference to the question of liability of the defendant
for its failure to convey 15,697 acres to these half-breeds because
of an erroneous survey, Congress is shown to have made an appropriation of $19,621.27, which was $1.25 per acre for the 15,697 acres
which the half-breeds failed to get, and that this.money was paid
to them in lieu.of the lands which they did not receive. The
plaintiff tribe had.made an outright cession of these lands for the
benefit of their half-breeds, and when the half-breeds were reimbursed for the loss of this acreage as to which complaint is made,
it would seem that the liability of the defendant for its error had
been discharged.

This Commission cannot sustain the contention of plaintiff that

defendant has not fully discharged its obligation growing out of

this erroneous survey.

Both claims, therefore, under the Second Cause of.Action must

be dismissed.

.7‘ i ‘C :*_-“mm CAUSE OF ACTION

This Cause of Action is based on the cession of 807,1!-56.’-L9 acres
of land made by the treaty of September 21, 1833. By stipulation this
acreage is reduced and fixed as T92,000_-acres.

Plaintiff contends that it had Indian title to the land ceded;
that the land had a true value at the time of the cession of $1.50 per
acre; that the consideration of $39,510.15, or 1l.9 cents per acre received by plaintiff for the cession was unconscionable and not fair,
and plaintiff should receive an award for the difference between’:-zhat
it was worth and what it received. therefor, together with 5 per cent
interest thereon from thedate of the treaty. .

The first question to be decided is whether or not the plaintiff
has established by satisfactory evidence the aboriginal possession and
ownership of the land involved.In this connection, attention is called to the reports by Charlevoix
in 3,723., _by Choteau in 1816, and by_Major Stephen H. Long in l820, all of
tom place the- plaintiff tribe in. occupancy of different villages on the
tract involved. No other tribe contested the occupancy in Indian fashion
or the claim of ownership of plaintiff tribe of any put of the entire
acreage involved at these dates . The eminent historian and researcher,
Dr. Waldo Wedel and his wife, Mrs. Wedel, and B, B. Chapman, Professor
of History at Oklahoma Ad-M College, all confirm the exclusive use and
occupancy by plaintiff of the tract involved herein, and probably somewhat further‘ West and south. DI‘. Chapman was positive in his testimony
that from his study of this tribe it possessed the area ceded in 1833

to the exclusion of all other tribes; that no other Indian tribe or

tribes claimed any part of this particular area; and that the adjoining

tribes recogiized the Otoe and Missouria ownership and possession thereof.
The treaty _involved was negotiated for the United States government by
Henry L. Ellsworth and he reported to the Secretary of _the Interior with
reference to the lands described in the treaty - “I find the Indian title
in said lands good.“

As confirmation of the generally recognized ownership of this land
by the plaintiff tribe, attention ‘is also called to the admitted ownership by the plaintiff tribe on the part of the United States to the lands
ceded by the 1830 treaty to ‘the half-breeds, in which treaty of cession
(July-15, 1830, 7 Stat. 328; Art. XI) the ownership of the lands ceded
to said half-breeds is stated as being in ‘the plaintiff tribe. This
tract is Plat 155 of Nebraska by Boyce, and lies immediately east of
the 1833 cession, and is further removed from the villages of the plaintiff tribe _just south of the Platte River than most of the 1833 cession,
and further than any part of the 18534; cession discussed later herein
upon which plaintiff's Fourth Cause of Act ion is based. As will be
pointed out in a discussion of the Fourth Cause of Action, which involves lands to the north of the cession of 1833, apmoximately 342 cents
per acre was paid the plaintiff tribe for said cession of 18514-, vdnich
price can hardly be considered as compensation for only a quitclaim,
rather than for recogized Indian title. This is very persuasive of
the ownership also of the lands ceded in 1833 involved in this Cause of
Action, because as stated, this 1333 cession lies largely between the
cession of 1851: and the Previous cession of 1330 to the half-breeds of

lands recognized as owned by the plaintiff tribe.

Based. upon the proof held necessary to establish Indian title as

made by this commission in previously decided cases , we are of the opinion that Indian title to the land in this cause of Action has been established. ’

The next question to determine is whether or not the consideration
received. by plaintiff tribe for the cession was unconscionable or so '
grossly inadequate as to be unfair and @ust. It is undisputed that
the consideration paid for the cession was $39 ,1-L10 .15, that is, 14.9
cents per acre. The evidence of value consists of the testimony and
research of Dr. Thomas E. Le Inc, Research Professor, Department of
History, University of Nebraska, a witness for‘ the plaintiff, and Mr.
John Muehlbeier, an Agricultural Economist of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, Department of .A.gricu.lture, a witness for the defendant.‘ The lands of this cession were not put on the market by
the defendant government until 1859; much of it was sold at the ceiling
price of $1.25 to actual settlers, and the only sales in evidence are
sales of smaller tracts in nearby states. Based on these sales, Dr.
138 Due contends that the land  be valued at $1.50 per acre as of
the date of the cession.’ MI‘. Muehlbeier places "a value of 15 cents an
acre on the land as of l833. It is conceded that the lands End no actual market value in tracts of the size involved at the time of the
‘cession.

We find that the 792,000 acres involved in this cause of action
had a fair actual value at the time of the cession of 75 cents per

acre, or a total of $591+,0OO .00.

Applying the principles and reasoning as to the determination

as to whether or not a consideration is unconscionable, as previously
held by this Commission and the Court of Claims, we decide that the
consideration paid for the land involved herein was unconscionable

and that plaintiff is entitled to an award in the amount of $591L,000.00,

less $39,1$l0.l5 paid‘ under the provisions of the cession, that is,

- $594,589.85, less such offsets, if any, as may hereinafter be allowed

in accordance with Section 12 of the General Rules of Procedure of this
Comission.
__-,1-ousm onus}: or ncmctgr

This Cause of Action is based on the treaty of ifarch l5, 18514»,
which ceded 1,250,000 acres (acreage and boundaries stipulated), west
of the Missouri River, together with any remaining claims the ‘plaintiff
tribe might have east of the river. The plaintiff claims Indian title
to the land west of the riverhceded and sues for additional compensation therefor based on the contention that the amount received under
the terms of the treaty was much less than the fair value of the land
ceded at the time, and was unconscionable. It is undisputed that the
money consideration for the cession ~.-.-as $1463.11-23.7]-I». '£he treaty also
grants to the plaintiff a reservation in lands owned by the government
in the amount of 162,107.71 acres in Kansas and Nebraska, vdiich tract
was located some miles to the south of the tract ceded, so that the
net acreage ceded to defendant was 1,087,892.29 acres.

The proof of possession and exclusive occupancy by plaintiff
tribe of said ceded tract is substantially the same as that of the
tract ceded in 1833, upon which treaty and cession the Third Cause

of action is based. Exerefore, we are of the opinion that possession

and exclusive occupancy of the land involved has been established; or

if not established, that such ownership was recognized by the defendant
forathe reasons set forth in the discussion of the Third Cause of Action,
and for the further reason that it is hardly conceivable that any such
consideration as was given the plaintiff tribe for this cession would
have been given for a mere quit-claim, or in the absence of recognized
ownership. As heretofore stated, the consideration in money for the

net acreage of 1,087,892.29 acres ceded was $1l63,1$23.'{3-L, being approximately 32 cents per acre. While said treaty also ceded whatever remaining rights the plaintiff tribe had in territory east of the liissouri
River, those rights were only hunting rights, the value of which are
little, if anything, because the game at the time” of the cession had.
largely, if not wholly, disappeared; and in l833 the area was occtqaied
by the Potawattomie Tribe to whom said land had been ceded by the United
States.

_ 4! The proof of value of the tract ceded as in the Third Cause of
Action consists almost wholly of _t—he testimony and research of Dr.
Thomas E. I-e Ihic, a witness for the plaintiff, and Mr. Jokm Muehlbeier,
a witness for the defendant. The lands involved in this tract include
more valley acreage because of the extensive frontage on the Platte and
Missouri Rivers; and this frontge also provides for the tract an easier
approach from the states to the east, to-—wit, Iowa and Missouri, which
were in 18511» rapidly being settled by the whites, together with better
transportation facilities than the acreage involved in the mird Cause

of Action. The value of this acreage must also be made as of a later

date than that involved in the Third Cause of Action, £ter more ' ¢—. .-u—-uu-.-.—_ . . _ . _.

development and increased demand for these lands had come about. Based,
upon his research, Dr. Le Duo contends that the land had a value as of

the date of the cession of $3 .165 per acre. Hr. Muehlbeier places the

value at 115 cents per acre.

He find that the 1,087,892.29 acres involved in this Cause of Action
had a fair actual. value at the time of the cession of $1.00 per acre, or
a total of $1,087,892.29.

while the difference between the value of _, the land involved,‘ as we
find it, and the consideration received for it, might not make the
compensation received unconscionable, yet under the facts and circumstances said consideration was so inadequate. as to be unfair and work
an injustice to the plaintiff tribe. Therefore, the connission finds
that the plaintiff is entitled to an award in the amount of $62l+,h68.55,
(being the difference between the $1463,1¥»23 .7’-L received for the land, and

its value of $1,087,892.29), less such offsets, if any, as may hereafter
be allowed in accordance with Section 12 of the General Rules of Procedure of t3J.s domission.
FIFTH AIIZD SIEH CAUSES 0,? ACTION

These two causes of action are based on the contention that lands,
the ownership of which is acknowledged to have been in the plaintiff,
were under acts of Congress sold for the benefit of the plaintiff, and
that the consent of plaintiff to said sales was secured by duress, and
that the selling procedures were at variance with the provisions of the
acts of Congress providing for such sales, and the consideration re-—
ceived therefor, as compared with the value of the lands at the time,

which plaintiff alleges was $7.53 per acre, was unconscionable; or in

any eve_nt, the defendant wasguilty of unfair and dishonorable dealings;

and that plaintiff should recover the difference between the value of the
lmids and the amount plaintiff received therefor.

me 119,8}-l»6.l'{ acres of lands involved in the Fifth Cause of Action,
appraised as having the average value of $3.56 per acre, were sold for a
total of $1&62,262.73, which was $3.85 per acre, ‘He-do not think that the
difference between the alleged value, if we so found such value (which we
do not),  the amount received, would mice the price received unconscionable; and the fact that the lands were sold for the amount at which
they were appraised at the time by three appraisers, one of whom was selected by the Indians themselves, would indicate fair and honorable
dealings. In this connection, it is significant that the same appraiser
selected by the Indians to appraise the land involved in this sale was, a
few years later, selected by the Indians as their appraiser of the value
of the lands from the sale of which arises the Sixth Cause of Action.
'2he¥Indians during this time were receiving substantial annuities from
the Federal Government and we are .of the opinion that the evidence does
not justify a finding that the agreement providing for the sale of these
lands was secured by duress.

The Sixth Cause of Action isbased on the sale of the remainder of
plaintiff's reservation, to-wit, 1¥2,26l acres, the sale of which was provided for by act of Congress of March 3, 1881. Ehese lands were sold for
an approximate average of $12.22 per acre, which was twice their appraised
value. The plaintiff contends that the fair actual value at the time of

sale was $15.23 per acre. We are of the opinion that the difference in

value between the lands and the price for v:h.ich they were sold, if there

was the difference claimed (which is not admitted), would not warrant a
finding that the consideration received was unconscionable, nor would
the sale or the methods of sale justify a finding of unfair and dishonorable dealings.

As stated, we are of the opinion that the consent of the plaintiff
was properly and fairly secured to the sales involved in these two causes
of action and was not due to duress, and that there were no irregularities
or procedures at such variance with the acts of Congress providing for
such sales as to invalidate the same; however, even though duress and
selling irregularities occurred, the defendant had the legal authority

to sell this land without the consent of the Indians and upon its own

lterms and conditions, subject only to liability for damages that may

have been sustained by the Indians through such action of the defendant.
Since the selling of said land was thought by the defendant to be

in the best interest of the Indians, and was marketed in a manner that

was thought to be fair and with a proper regard for the interest of the

Indians, and for the first tract sold there was received by the Indians

a slight increase over the appraised value of the land, and in the second

sale there was received more than twice the appraised value of the land,

it is thought all the duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff was

discharged fairly and honorably, and that no liability was incurred to

the plaintiff regardless of whether or not there was duress in the securing of plaintiff's consent to the selling, or a variance in the

method of selling to that prescribed by the statutes providing therefor.
Therefore, both the Fifth and Sixth Causes of Action should be

dismissed.

SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
This Cause of Action is based on the contention of plaintiff that
a compromise settlement dated November 20, 1899, between the plaintiff
Indians and certain delinquent purchasers of lands previously owned by
the plaintiff and a part of their reservation in Kansas and Nebraska,

under the terms of which $168,784.08 (a stipulated amount), then due and

I

owing by these purchasers should be "forgiven,"was of no binding effect

because it was secured by duress and fraud, based on no existing law
authorizing the same, was due to neglect on the part of the defendant
government as guardian of the plaintiff, its ward; and that plaintiff

should have a judgment against the defendant for said $168,784.08, and

"interest.

Long prior to the execution of this instrument there had been
default in payment by many purchasers of land previously owned by the
plaintiff tribe in Kansas and Nebraska, and these purchasers at the time
of the execution of said instrument were in default to the extent of
$288,583.08 and had for many years been making the contention that misrepresentations had been made to them at the time they purchased the lands;
that prices they were induced to bid on .said lands were far in excess of
their value at the time, and that in justice and equity some readjustment
of their contracts of purchase should be made and they should be granted
some rebates or reductions thereon. By act of Congress of March 3, 1893
(27 Stat. 568) the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to revise the
sales involved, "the consent of the Indians having first been .obtained,''.
by allowing to the purchasers rebates on amounts paid or agreed to be

paid. The nature of these rebates remained in controversy until the

compromise settlement of November 20, 1899 was entered into, This
proposed settlement  thereafter ratified by Congress by act of
April It, 1900 (31 Stat. 59). The vote by which the House of B.ePresentatives approved this settlement was 1014 to l3. and Dennis T. Flynn,
a delegate from Oklahoma Territory in whose district the Indians were
then living, urged the passage of the bill approving the settlement ,
stating among other things, “If we hang up this settlement it is uncertain whether the Indians will ever get the money.“

While there is evidence that this compromise settlement was executed
in an irregular way by the tribe md not in formal council - we do not
thin}: that such evidence is "sufzficient to discredit the document as a
voluntary and binding waiver on the part of the Indians of the amount _
therein involved. The document provides for the acceptance by the Indians
of a. proposition made by the delinquent purchasers by a recasting of their
P11-1‘chase cohntracts so as to make provision for a sale of the lands involved
at the appraised value plus 25 per cent thereof, plus annual interest at
the rate of 5 per cent per annm from the time of their purchases, and for
immediate payment of the purchase price on the basis of such revised sales
price. This instrument involved a reduction of the purchase price in the
amount of $l68,'{81+.08 (e. stipulated amount).

This proposed settlement was submitted to  Indians a f ew days
before its actual execution, by James McLaughlin, the United States
Indian Inspector, a man referred to by the plaintiff in its brief as a
“reliable” trouble-shooter. lciclsaughlin, immediately after the execution of the instrument, and many times thereafter, with reference

to the circumstances of its execution, stated that it was fully ex‘ "9 -n--71¢:-n-_..— -.—..._j_-....--_....._... ...., o

plained to the Indians_ and that they signed the same with full knowledge

and understanding of its contents. We find that there was no ulterior
motive on the part of said McLaughlin actuating him in his activities

or his statements, and nothing to reflect upon him as a man of honor and
integrity.

Congress thereafter, as stated above, approved the settlement made
after giving full consideration to the matters involved.

7 It is in evidence that a majority of the Indians were capable and
intelligent persons, and one-half or more of those signing the document
well understood the English language and were able to sign their own
names to this paper. Among ‘the siaatures are those of Richard W.
Shunatona, who had been selected by the Indians as-their special interpreter, and Mitchell Dervin, the official interpreter, both being
members of the tribe at the time. These interpreters also signed a certificate to -the instrument, certifying that they had fully and carefully
interpreted a.'l.l that had passed between the Indian Inspector (McLaughlin)
and said Indians, and that the Indians thoroughly understood the nature
of the subject matter in controversy, and that they had siaed the same
of their on free will and volition.

While it is a fact that years later some of the Indians who executed
this settlement docuznent testified to questionable conduct on the part of
Hclaaughlin and to traitorous conduct on their own part, this testimony
was that of self-serving witnesses, which, we do not thin}: should overcome
the statements of Mclaughlin himself, statement of the interpreters, and
that subsequent ratification, after full consideration, by the Congress

of the United States.

Although the defendant government was at the time a trustee for
the Indians in the matter of sale of and collection for these lands,
yet, as to this particular transaction, the Indians had been recognized‘
as of sufficient intelligence and mental capacity to determine for themselves as to whether or not they would accept the terms of settlement

proposed, the Congressional Act of 1893 authorizing a compromise of these

matters, provided that no settlement should be made except“ with the consent

of the Indians. Therefore, it would seem that as to this transaction they

were recognized as and were “sui juris.”

In this connection, attention is called to the fact that the defendant

in no way benefited by this settlement, but the same was in settlement of a

controversy entirely between the Indians and the defaulting purchasers of
their lands.

As for the contention that the instrument vzasgexecuted by individual

members of ‘the tribe and not the action of the Indians as a council, this

seems immaterial to us; The act of Congress of 1893 merely provided that

the consent of the Indians should be obtained, and it is in evidence that

three-fourths of the adult members of the tribe siged the instrument. A

similar document in the form of a release was held valid by the Supreme

Court in the case of'E.amath and Moadoc Tribesjvs. United States, 296 U.S.

elm. Such release, while submitted to the Indians in council, as was done

in the instant case, was executed by the siging of the individual Indians.

Attention is also called to the language of the Court in holding the release valid because it was not shown. that “anything was done to overreach
the plaintiffs. On the contrary, the circumstances disclosed by the findings

tend quite strong to indicate that the negotiations were fairly conducted.“

As in the D.emath case, our findings fail to show that any person

i
   acting for the United States deceived or misled the plaintiff in

 connection with the transaction under scrutiny.
..-i   o In determining the validity of this compromise settlement and

its binding effect on the Indians, consideration must also be given

J’  .». _ to the fact that the original purchase price of the lands involved

was-far in excess of the appraised value thereof -- that said ap‘ V  praised value had been determined by appraisers, one of whom had been

’ 5"?  selected by the Indians themselves — that contentions had been made

1 , from time to time of misrepresentations made by government agents at

the time the sales were made, and that promises of adjustment of excessive bidding were made at the time — and that the controversy over

full payment of the unpaid portion of the original @chase price had '

  raged unabated for a period of sixteen years following the sale.

. While it is argued by the plaintiff that the reason for difficulty
in “getting the money“ was the political influence of the settlers who
wanted the rebate, and not because the land involved was not worth the
full balance due, the question as to whether or not to make this rebate

and get the balance imediately was a practical one. The Indians,

 doubtless, came to the conclusion that they would prefer to get "the

bird in hand” rather than to try for the ‘two in the bush."

AWARD

From the above opinion and findings of fact on which based, it
follows that plaintiff is entitled to an awa-d in the mount of
$1,179,o58.1%o. less such offsets, 1: any, as may heresitper he allowed.
in accordance with Section 12 of the General Rules of Procedure of
this Commission.

On the question of plaintiff ‘s right to interest on the awards
made, we are of the opinion that there was not a Vtalzing" of plaintiff s‘
lands in a. constitutional sense, and the Indian Claim-as Commission Act
does not provide for the allowance of interest on awards made under
clauses (3) or (5) of Section 2 of the Act. Interest on the award,

therefore, is not allowed.
