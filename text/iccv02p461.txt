FEINGS OF FACT

The Commission makes the following Findings of Fact:

1. The Ottawa Endians are, ethnologically speaking, of Algonquin stock.
The ward Ottawa is an Indian word meaning "trader" and is the tern used by
other Indians and white men after the first contact to identify those Indians

of the Algonquin race with linguistic and cultural characteristics and of a

common ancestry which differentiate said Indians from other Algonquins such
as the Chippewa and Pottawatomie Indians who were also Algonquins. (See

2. The earliest known contact made by white men with that group of

Algonquin Indians which became known as Ottawas, occurred in the year l6l5
when Samuel de Champlain, a Frenchman, visited them in the area south or

southwest of Georgian Bay. Champlain called them the "Cheveux Releves"

or “High Hairs,” and reported them to be a numerous people who "have severe
chiefs who take command, each in his own district." ‘(See Deft's. Ex. 12}.

3. In the early contact period, that is, during the l7th century, as

many as seven Ottawa Tribes of Indians are mentioned by historians. The

tribes of Ottawas most frequently mentioned during that period were four in
number; the Kiskakons, the ttawas du Sable, the Ottawa-Sinago, and th
"people of the Fork." These four divisions of Ottawa Indians were indiscriminately referred to by contemporary writers in the‘contect period

Nations, Tribes, and Bands. Beginning with the last half of the 18th c

ntt
such denominations of the Ottawa Indians became extant and the various grot
and bands of Ottawa Indians began to be known by their geographic location

rather than by their totemic, or clan, designations. Even during the early

Jcontact period certain bands or tribes of Cttawas were known solely by thei

geographic names such as the Cttawas du Sable and the "people of the Forkr”
(See Deft's. Ens. l4, l6, l7, 18, 23, 24, 26, 27 and 28).

4. Although one discovers, in documents relative to the early contact

period and in documents pertaining to the early transactions between the

United States and the Indians, the use of the words " ttawa Nation" or

.- . , ¢-T.-.

ibe“ -aere is no record existing to establish the fact that the:

States, or which possessed a continuity of collective or communal existence
with a common leadership and which evidenced an exercise of political authority over all Ottawa Indians. (See Testimony of Kinietz, Tr. pp. 95, 96,

97, 1043 111, 112, 113, 114, 130, 131, 132, 133 and 134‘.

l"'T'

5. inc documentation of the history of the Ottawa Indians from their

.-s.

rirst contact with white men to the present time illustrates vividly the

‘I

division of the ttawa Indians into seyarate and independent tribes, bands

and groups which were wholly autonomous in their political actions and

Jother movements. At the beginning of the 19th century there was no policical connection between the Ottawa Indians in tee northwestern section

or the lower peninsula of Michigan with the Ottawa Indians on the Manmee
according to an interview Henry R. Schoolcraft, a noted authority, had
wits an Ottawa Indian of northern Michigan. In l82l the Grand River

Gttawas, who were located along that river in southwestern Michigan,

three h their chief, speaking at the treaty council considering the Treaty

=..'..'J

~ust 29, 1821, complained that the Grand River Ottawas had no par

in the treaties whereby the Ottawas of the Manmee had ceded tneir claimed
in: rest in lands. (See Deft”s. Exs. l, 3, 12, 18, 23, 24, 25, 27 and 28).

6. when the United States first treated with the Indians within

rs"!

its borders, begirnine in 1785, the Ottawa Indians of the Northwest retri“(.7

tory were scattered in independent bands and groups over an immense terri‘K

tory in the area of the Great Lakes. Along the Mannee River and its tribu$&Il€o in Ohio were the Ottawas an an as the Ottawas of the Mawmcc, or too

were located in the vicinity of the Grand River in Michigan; while
still others had settled further south as far as the Saint Joseph River,
in the southwestern part of Michigan. There were also a few Ottawas who
had found their way into Wisconsin and Northeastern Illinois. A small
part of the Ottawas were also located in Canada on Manitoulin and Walpole
Islands. (See De t's. Ex. 31). I

7. From 1785 to 1867, the Ottawa Indians were parties to numerous
treaties with the United States. The terminology of the treaties variously
referred to the groups or bands of Ottawa Indians so treating with the
Suited States as the "Ottawa Nation," tae "Ottawa Tribe" or the treaties
mentioned specifically the bands or groups parties to the treaty. In
addition, Ottawa Indians are mentioned in other treaties as affiliated with

“Unite Tribes of Ottawas, Chipawas, and Pottecertain groups such as the
watcmees, residing on the Illinois and Melwakee rivers, and their waters”;
the "Snited Nations of Chippewa, ttawa and Potawatomie Indians, of the

waters of the Illinois, Milwaukee, and Manitoouck Rivers"; and the "United

Nation of Chippewa, Ottawa and Potawatomie Indians." In two other treaties

groups or bands of Ottawa Indians are referred to as being affiliated with

sother tribes or bands. (See Treaties).

8. The available definite information as to the location of the lands
ceded by the Treaties of August 3, 1795, July 4, 1805, November 17, 1807,
September 29, 1817, and August 29, 1821, together with an analysis of the
provisions of said treaties and a comparison of the Indian signatories
to said treaties makes it clear that these negotiations were executed by

certain bands or groups of Ottawa Indians rather than by an Ottawa Nation

or Tribe embracing within its authority all Ottawa Indians in the united
States. (See Treaties).
9. The following annuities were payable to the Ottawa Indians under

Q

tae treaties listed below as of the year 1822:

Ereaty Annuity Type
August 3, 1795 $1,000 Permanentl
November 17, 180? $ 800 Permanent
September 29, 1817 $1,000 15 years
September 17, 1818 $1,500 Permanent
August 29, 1821 $1,000 Permanent

(See treaties).
10. The records of the Government available for study at this time

fail to disclose the amounts disbursed for Ottawa annuities from 1796 to
1811. The records from 1812 to 1820 indicate only that disbursements were
made for the Ottawa Tribe or Cation without disclosing the specific bands
or groups of Ottawa Indians receiving said annuities. .Beginning with tnc

‘F

'1 to 1862 disbursements are shown as saving been made to two groups

of Ottawas. One group was identiiied as the Ottawas residing on the Grand
River in Michigan and the other group was ascertained to be the Gttawas
residinr on the Miami (Meamee} River and its tributary streams in Ohio, or
the Ottawas of the Maumee, Blanchard‘s Fork, Auglaize and Roche de Boeuf.
{Sea Deft's. Ex. 5).

11. Th~ records of the General Accounting Office of the United States

disclose th t in the year 1821 the Grand River Band of ttawas in the

£1.

'te of Michigan received an annuity payment of $700.00 while the Ottawas

-- 1

or tae Maumee, B1anchard's Fork and Roche de Boeuf received an annvity payment of $3,600.00. In 1822 the annuities of the Grand River Band of Gttawas

2 466
were increased to $1,700.00 following the Treaty of August 29, 1821,
while the annuities of the Ottawas of the haumee, Blanchard's Fork and
Roche de Boeuf remained $3,600.00. In 1834, the annuities paid to
the Ottawas of the Maunee, B1anchard's Fork and Roche de Boeuf were
reduced $1,000.00 to $2,600.00 when the fifteen-year annuity payable
under the Treaty pf September 29, 1817, (7 Stat. 160; II Kapp. 145)
to the Ottawa Tribe elapsed. (See Deft's. Ex. 5).

12. Ehe records of the Government disclose that only two groups
of Ottawa Indians were the recipients of annuities from the United States
in the year 1821. They were the Ottawas of the Grand River in what is
now t.e State of Michigan and the Ottawas of Ohio, or the Ottawas of the
Maumee, B1anchard's Fork and Roche de Boeuf. Documentary proof also discloses that prior to 1820 the Grand River Ottawas had not been receiving
any annuities nor had any of the other bands-of Ottawa Indians in Michigan
been receiving_annuities. (See De£t's. Exs. 1 and 5).

13. The Ottawa Indians, who were parties to the Treaties of August 3,
1795, July 4, 1805, November 17, 1807, September 29, 1817, and September 18
1818, and who were thereafter recognized as having the larger interest
in.the Ottawa annuities provided by said treaties, were-those bands and
groups of Dttawas known as the Ottawas of the Maumee, B1anehard's Fork,
Auglaize and Roche de Boeuf (whose successors in interest are the petitioners in Docket 133). (See Testimony of William Vernon Kinietz, Tr.

b. 157; also, treaties of August 30, 1831 (7 Stat. 359); Febr. 18, 1833
(7 Stat. 220); June 24, 1862 (12 Stat. 1237); and Febr. 23, 1867 (15 Stat.

513, 517)).

2 467

14. The Ottawa Indians who were parties to the Ereaty of ingest 29,
1321, and who'were thereafter recognized as having the right :r the
entire Ottawa annuity provided by said treaty, were those Ottawes known
as the Ottawas of Grand River in Michigan. This group also participated
in previous annuities. (See Findings Nos. 11 and 12). Their snccessors
in interest are the petitioners in Dockets 40eB, C, D, E and F. (See
Claimant's Exs. 1 and 2, and Defendant's Ex. 5).

15. The treaties executed by the ttawas and other Indians with
the United States of dates August 3, 1795 (7 Stat. 49); July 4, 1805“

(7 Stat. 87); Nov. 17, 1807 (7 Stat. 1057; Nov. 25, 1808 (7 Stat. 112);
Sep. 29, 1817 (7 Stat. 160); Sep. 17, 1818 (7 Stat. 178); Aug. 29, 1821

1867 (15 tat. 513), by reference are a part of the record and are hereby
made a part of these Findings of ?act.

16. Defendant’s Exhibit No. 5 in its entirety, by reference is
hereby made a part of these Findings.

17. The evidence shows that the Ottawa Indians were not recognized
as a single political entity; and all the lands ceded by the various
tr aties were not owned by the ttawa Nation as a single entity, but
wtatever ownership was'had and whatever right of cession existed was in
specific bands-or groups of Ottawa Endians.

18. Claims are now maintaineble only by the successors in interest

of the respective bands of Ottawas, and recoveries are to be had, if any,

the lands involved and made the basis of claims. Such interests are
determinable only after the introduction of evidence upon the trial of
the cases on their merits; awards, if any, will be made to the respective

bends if the liability of the defendant is shown-to exist.
