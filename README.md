##Text Analysis of the Indian Claims Commission Decisions
==============

The Indian Claims Commission was a legal body that adjudicated hundreds of claims that Indian Tribes had against the United States for past wrongs. It produced 43 volumes of decisions over more than 30 years of work. This work attempts to analyze how the Commission used historical knowledge and provide a case study in using text mining over a large corpus of documents.

This analysis collected the the Decisions from [Oklahoma State University:](http://digital.library.okstate.edu/icc/index/iccindex.htm)
Performed OCR of the PDFs using tesseract and Lincoln Mullen's make recipe from [Civil-Procedure-Codes](https://github.com/lmullen/civil-procedure-codes)

The rest of the work is various R scripts that process and analyze the textural data. It was created as a final class project for CLIO3: Hist 698 at George Mason University
